For the difference between a rational and an irrational number: A rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are integers, and the denominator is not zero. An irrational number cannot be expressed as a simple fraction and has a decimal expansion that is non-terminating and non-repeating. Examples of rational numbers include \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) and \\( -2 \\), while an example of an irrational number is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) or \\( \\pi \\).\n",

The correct answer is '29', which is a prime number. The other choices (4, 15, 28) are not prime because they have additional divisors: 4 is divisible by 2, 15 is divisible by 3 and 5, and 28 is divisible by 2 and 14.\n",
