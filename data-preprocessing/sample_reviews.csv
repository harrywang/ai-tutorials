We went in on a Sunday evening, with reservations. When we arrived, the host told us that there were no tables available in the quiet area (we had not asked for a quiet table), so if we wanted to sit away from the stage, we would need to wait. She suggested we sit at one of the bar tables and have a drink and an appetizer. While we were asking her if she would come get us when a table was ready, another party of two interrupted us to let the host know they would be seating themselves in the quiet area. Rather than let the party know she would take care of them after she finished with us, the host left us standing there while she followed them to a table with menus. They sat at a table that would have accommodated three people, and informed the host they did not need menus, as they were just there for drinks (begging the question why the host did not seat them in the bar area and give the party with the dinner reservation the table in the quiet area). We then sat at a low table (not appropriate for dining), and the host did follow us with menus. We sat for several minutes (I waited tables for 10 years and know guests' tendency to exaggerate, but it was at least 5 minutes) before being greeted by our server. The two other members of our party had already chosen drinks, but I wanted to know which gins they offered. Our server simply said they had ""a lot"" and did I have a particular one in mind. I said I wanted a pine-y gin, and she said she only liked botanical gins, so could only recommend Tanqueray. This is a very small qualm that I would not mention if the rest of the experience had been good, but she should have offered to check with the bartender for a recommendation. I ordered Tanqueray on the rocks and our server never returned. At least 10 minutes after ordering our drinks, with no one having come by to check on us or let us know about our drinks or table, we walked out. On our way out of the restaurant, both the host and manager simply said ""thank you,"" either unaware or indifferent to the fact that we had not been served. When we walked out, it was around 25 minutes from the time we walked in.",2014-10-24 02:02:29

I was not even able to get my poor cat's RX filled after multiple phone calls and transfers to different people.  Horrible experience.  It was not anything unusual that should have been hard for them.  The vet called in capsules but liquid is easier so they changed it immediately after putting me on hold forever and before I was done asking questions.  When they returned I found out they automatically were putting chicken flavor in which our cats never liked at other pharmacy - but they loved cherry, so asked for that.  OMG - they have to change the entire compounding protocol to use cherry and would have to put me on hold forever again just to find out if this was even possible - and it would take days extra if by chance it was even possible and on and on and on....   Help!  Save me from ever asking that again!  Ridiculous - at the other pharmacy they ask what flavor and then just do it.  Amazing concept.  Now mind you - I am at work and trying to work and must work long hours. Finally we are set and we are getting fake chicken flavor our cats have hated in the past - the price is now over $90 for just 10 ml of liquid and the cat takes .65 ml at a time.  What?  The pill form was $50.  How could this even be?  I have purchased at lot more of this drug - in cherry and liquid for a lot less with fewer phone calls and less time.  I could not deal with them any more at this point and had to end call.  They called me back to harass me some more a little bit later and I had to tell them I am done with you now and the sad part it is hurting my cat - the very one they are supposed to be helping.  Yeah right - charging over $90 for 10 ml of a liquid medicine that normally sells for a lot less - that's right - they don't care about you or your pet.  Guess my old
compounding pharmacy is looking good.  And I am so mad they put me on hold and bothered my vet without even letting me finish or say if I even wanted them to actually do that!  It would have been nice if they mentioned the extreme price change no one else charges at that point.   Idiots - the lot of them involved in the entire mess that I was transferred around to.  Should have been 1 - 2 people, with them calling me back - no surprise epic holds!  I am so done!",2020-06-18 09:59:51

This property group managed my sight in Hartford, CT.  Story below.

A very similar experience to everyone else here.  I rented a unit from October 2009 to October 2010.  I was a good tenant, paid my rent, and created little bother despite several issues like the ones listed above.  I even remember seeing the guy with 4 unleashed pitbulls running out of the place! I actually think I was living there while this happened and I saw the security guard that got hurt.

Unlike Lynn K., I was promised free parking for 1 person and the option of $50 per month for the purchase of an additional spot.  When I later tried to claim another spot the management said that they had never heard of such a deal.  The company had hired another company to fill the units upon opening which then disappeared as soon as the place was mildly occupied.  They also could not provide with the name of the person I talked to (who signed my lease as witness), which just blew my mind.  

Upon move out I was calling to ask where I needed to put the keys as I heard nothing from them.  They then informed me that there is an automatic renewal if I do not give them notice within 60 days of the lease ending.  In my past experience, when you sign a 1 year lease, it terminates within one year.  There is a clause in the contract stating that the lease will automatically renew if written notice is not given.  Basically a new contract is in effect WITHOUT YOUR SIGNATURE!  Totally unheard of by me.  As with Lynn K., I then discovered loads of hidden fees and no help in re-renting the unit.  

I had worked out the problem with a manager by the name of Donna in which only my security deposit would be collected.  It is now OVER a year later and I am receiving calls from a collection agency about back owed fees.  Donna is no longer there and I had long ago deleted email correspondence about this because the issue was resolved.

This is clearly a company trying to trick clients into paying for as much as possible and without any support to the tenants.  Avoid this at all cost and don't let the remodeled exterior fool you.  Like everyone else who has written, you will end up paying more than you planned for in the end.",2011-11-16 20:00:14
L9_NsptDT4U-AM0VodoC1g,4DyMRBKrokax6d8LCI3GAw,S8saWaZlToeNoloR2fMrAQ,5.0,32,20,25,"When I am bored and tired of tasting local light red wines, I always end my own wine stroll (or tour when guests are in town) at Grassini. After relocating from Seattle many moons ago, I had grown a love big, bold Bordeaux varietals like Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot, and Malbec. I am so glad to have Grassini's tasting room serve this style of wine.

What makes Grassini's Tasting Room special is that it is semi-hidden within the gorgeous El Paseo among the alleyways and fruit trees. This not only demonstrates the classic character and history of Santa Barbara (heck, De La Guerra family's own wine cellar is just around the corner), but it is also a world away from the Funk Zone plagued with immature wine palettes. The tasting room fits a Western theme of wood and leather with a beautiful fireplace to keep cozy. Be sure to take a peek at the beautiful wood tasting counter! There is a separate dining room for groups and an outdoor patio for those pleasant days. They also conveniently offer cold water from a machine and cell phone chargers.

Now let's get to the wines! I am not a huge fan of white wine, though Grassini is well-respected for their award-winning Sauvignon Blanc. Segwaying into red wines...Few know that the Grassini Family Vineyards possesses the oldest Cabernet Sauvignon vines in Santa Barbara County--and it shows! While the bottles poured in the tasting room are roughly 4-5 years old (it's currently 2020, so they're pouring 2015 & 2016s), all their wines are still extremely robust and full of complex flavors. The estate Cabernet Sauvignon and the Articondo (a cuvée of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Petit Verdot) are always my top two wines to sip on. However, I never pass up a taste of their exquisite Merlot which has a very small slice of acreage and low production on their estate.

Whether or not they have a bottle of Equipo open when you visit, trust me and buy a bottle. It is a super affordable, delicious red table wine, yet what I most appreciate is that all the proceeds go toward the ""equipo"" (team) that works in the vineyards to produce Grassini's fabulous wines.
No matter who is pouring at the tasting room, I can always count on being treated well and them being knowledgeable about wine. I must say, however, that if Lauren and Ronnie are my top picks to be around. Sidenote: If you become a wine member, you can always request a private tour of their Happy Canyon Vineyard. Unfortunately, the property is closed to the public due to horses being bred nearby. For now drink up and enjoy photos of the vineyard on the TV--Cheers!",2020-01-19 17:52:24

I ordered a double whiskey from Main Bar and the bartender asked for my I.D. I live in Idaho and came to Reno with 6 friends for my birthday. I knew that my driver's license expired on my birthday and didn't want to have any issues with it when I came to Reno, so l went to my local DMV to get it renewed prior to our trip. In Idaho when you renew your license, they take your expired one and give you a paper one that says ""temporary"" on it. You keep this license for 2-3 weeks while they create you a hard copy of the license and then send it to you by mail. The temporary ID is a state issued, VALID ID, that has absolutely everything on it that a plastic ID has, except it is made of paper because it is TEMPORARY. Keep in mind there is absolutely no way around this. Every single person in Idaho who renews their license receives a paper temporary ID for 2-3 weeks. Every single one! I used this temporary ID to check into the hotel. The front desk looked at it a little funny but still allowed me to check in with no problems. I used it to acquire my Players Card with absolutely no problems. The bartender at Main Bar looked at it for 5 seconds and then told me he would have to have security come verify it. Security was there almost instantly and approached me. I showed him the ID and without even looking at it for a second he said ""We don't take no paper ID's"". I kindly explained to him that it was a valid ID while I was waiting for my hard copy. He told me that's not how it worked and that the DMV would give me my hard copy with holes punched in it. That is absolutely not true in my state. This guard also told me that my ID looked photocopied, which was very insulting as I am a 33 year old, law abiding, government employee holding a state issued valid ID card in my hand. I continued to try and explain what a temporary ID is to this guy, and he decided to call another guard in to look at it. Another guy came in and I should have got his name but I didn't. He was extremely obese if that helps identify him. This guy was even ""tougher"" than the first and also immediately rejected the ID because it was made of paper, without even inspecting it. I told him that I had been using it all weekend at this casino and used it to check in to your hotel. He said he didn't care and that he would not accept it in his casino. I told him he was being ridiculous for turning down a state issued valid ID and he said ""No I'm not"". At this point all six of my friends were standing near me and were suggesting we go somewhere else. We all walked out of the casino over to Circus Circus and Silver Legacy, and spent the next several hours there gambling before returning to Sands to go to sleep. I'm writing all this to let you know that because of the service I received, mostly by the security guards, you lost 7 people's business that night, and I will not be returning to Sands in my lifetime or recommending it. This was my second stay there and used to be my casino of choice, but I will be going elsewhere on my next Reno visit.",2018-10-20 17:49:49

To me, this place isn't that bad for what you get, especially when it's cold and I don't want to wash my own car. They say they charge more than $25 for an SUV but they didn't for mine.

At this place I paid $25 to have my car hand-washed and towel dried, waxed, tire shine, the mats scrubbed, the inside vacuumed. Only I didn't know that's what I got for $25 so I wasn't prepared. We had just driven cross-country and I had a lot of stuff in my car. The signs are confusing and don't actually lay out exactly what you get. Turns out I was getting more than I thought so that was good.

They did a good job but the place was slightly confusing. There are a ton of people working and they pointed where to go but I still wasn't sure where to drive because  there are two lanes, and had to back up a little and go into the correct lane. Basically, once you drive around if you're getting a hand wash, go into the far lane. If you're going through the washer go into the closer lane (the one with the drive through wash, duh) and they'll rinse and scrub down your car a little first before you go in. Someone pulled up behind me into the wrong lane and they had to move so I could back out when I was done.

They have a sheltered waiting area you can get inside while you get out of your car for them to do the inside.

Anyhow I did the $25 option and they snubbed down the car with different types of brushes and sponges , then hand dried it with stiff, wax-infused towels. Then they had me back up and drive into the drying lane but I hadn't realized this so I just told them I didn't want to have the inside done (we had way too much luggage and trash lying around). I didn't ask for my money back because I didn't know I was getting this service anyhow, but they sure as heck didn't offer it back to me either.

When the car was done it looked really good. I saw some places around the plastic the outlines the tires that had some dirt that washed out, but for as dirty as it was it looked great. I had never waxed my car and it looked awesome. When I came out the next day in the sun I was like ""WOW!!"" and taking pictures of my car bc it looked sooooo nice. The tires were new anyhow but looked amazing after being scrubbed and shined. Some guy actually came out and asked if someone had messed with my car since I was taking pictures! XD

I will most likely come back here to get my car washed again. I'll spray it off myself at the car wash to keep the salt off but before I head back home I'll probably be prepared to let them do the inside to. For $25, you can't beat it!",2015-11-30 18:59:28
KqFTVcT5ICQAKqG5UBqVUA,vhMMA4vymXwtoTbIrD1g6A,BXfXO9qx67QjzASjMVyJwA,5.0,4,0,0,"Just purchased a 2014 Audi Q7 from here.  Was in the market for an SUV and really hadn't narrowed it down much since one day to the next I'd consider a third row a must have while other days it wouldn't be a big deal.  Also hadn't decided if I really cared to have a 'luxury' SUV or save money.  So, this indecision lead to me visiting Reeves Audi, a few Ford dealers, Infiniti, Lexus, Acura, Jeep, Dodge and VW.  I did a LOT of research on all the various models I was considering and put together a spreadsheet with the information.  What I didn't have, I'd ask of the dealer.

In any case, my experience with Chris Billings at Audi Tampa was far and away the best out of all the dealers and sales folks.  He knew everything about the car and was very well rehearsed at presenting every single feature to you.  He didn't bumble around like many of the other dealers trying to remember what they should show me, he had an answer to every question I asked and there was zero pressure.  He even took the cellular SIM card out of his own Audi to use when demonstrating the navigation system since to get the full demonstration, the vehicle needs an active cellular connection to feed it real time data from Google Maps and Earth.

In the end, I decided the price premium for the Audi over one other finalist was worth it since it was just so much higher quality.  When it came time to make it all happen, I got what I feel was a fair price.  The 'finance guy' you always encounter when buying a car was right next to all the sales staff in a clean brightly lit room.  He presented all the add-on revenue generating stuff like you get at every car dealer; extended warranties, paint protection, etc. and when I declined them all, that was it and we moved on.  It wasn't like many car dealers where some creepy guy in the basement of the dealership gives you the ultra hard sell on why you can't live without that extended warranty.

I was in and out in probably four hours, with at least half that time being them doing a very thorough detailing job on the car; not a spray down and cover the car in swirl marks by using a dirty rag.  Could not have been happier with the experience.",2014-01-27 22:47:23
FJZPw60_ttf1doO4tdzayA,Spz8JoUlPT1kdpUL6x-CGw,F96zZwm8zAMxUB2DvLkmEA,1.0,1,2,1,"I just returned from a very disappointing dinner experience at Roberto Cafe with a group of 5 friends. I came into the restaurant with good spirits; I love Italian food and was excited to try a new BYOB in Philadelphia. As soon as we sat down, though, it felt like we were a low priority: one member of our group wasn't given a menu, we had to ask for bread three times before they brought it, and we repeatedly asked for water refills. These inconveniences were annoying, but there are three reasons why I'll never return to Roberto Cafe: 

(1) A member of our party, who is a vegetarian, tried to order the Penne Amatriciana (""Penne pasta with pancetta, onions, and romano cheese in a lightly spicy marinara sauce"") without the pancetta.  When the dish came, it was literally a bowl of penne with marinara sauce. My friend asked where the onions and cheese were, and if the sauce was spicy. Our waiter (presumably the owner) assured us that the onions were inside the tomato sauce (even though we didn't see any onions, even minced onion), then he brought over some red pepper flakes to ""make the sauce spicy"" and, after more requests, finally some cheese. Upon spooning cheese onto the penne, the waiter made sure to tell me that my gnocchi had cheese on it already, but if I wanted more, he would give me some more. 

(2) Overall, the food was less than mediocre: the bread basket didn't even have enough bread for everyone at our table (there were six of us, so it shouldn't have been difficult to put six slices of bread in the basket). The portions were also TINY: I left starving (I'm 5""2, 110 lbs, and I had a snack before coming to dinner) and I've never left any restaurant -- much less a restaurant where I load up on carbs -- hungry. 

(3) The menu prices in the restaurant did not reflect the menu prices listed on the website. I think that this is an extremely dishonest way to conduct business. Finally, when we got our bill, which averaged $16/person (for our bowls of pasta and sauce, which probably cost less than $3 to produce) we saw that there was a predetermined 20% tip built into our bill.  We assumed that there would be a fixed gratuity because we were a party of 6, but we didn't know that it would be 20%. Additionally, and outrageously, the bill was totally illegible and impossible to decipher, and our ""tip"" was based off of the price AFTER tax. In other words, we ended up tipping on more than 20% of our food bill because our tip was calculated on top of the tax. 

I go to restaurants to eat food that is better than what I make at home. I also don't like to feel like I'm being taken advantage of, especially when I'm paying for food. Roberto Cafe should be more careful with the way in which it describes its dishes on its menu and in how it calculates its bills -- tip and tax are always calculated independently of one another. If I could give this restaurant zero stars, I would.",2014-02-23 03:19:41
oouOXojsE3Vwf64S3TsWjA,AvGJVv7Z3a0q1MJT1Ykd0w,1LUZupYFJ6CxSKU37qDSXw,4.0,9,9,4,"As I accepted this hefty menu and felt it's weight  (I'm thinking like a large, newborn baby) I knew I was in for a different experience to my usual chain fare.

We had come after seeing a movie at AMC. My buddy and I wanted to try a place we hadn't before so Redstone was it. I had heard it was good. Preston and Steve crew often talks about it do I was ready to join the Elite (not Yelp Elite, of which I'm already a member , but real world Elite).

The place is gorgeous, from staff to decor (and later food). On a Thursday at 5pm, it was bustling but we were sat immediately. Our server was Nick, who was pitch perfect in light conversations, putting up with my dad jokes, food and drink suggestions, and pacing. We were neither bothered by him or in need of him.

I'll admit that I wasn't paying for the meal, but had a case of sticker shock while perusing the menu. I surpassed the $40 steaks and fell to the thing that my basic bitch ass always loves...meatloaf. What they described sounded divine but for $19 I was being stubborn. My friend insisted I get it however, so I went for it.

He also ordered a Jerk chicken fondue appetizer which was out of this world. I dipped everything they gave us in that cheese; Croutons, grapes, apples, chicken (we also ordered steak chunks)
And also dunked a few things they didn't give us. My apologies about the woman's weave at the table next to ours.

My meatloaf finally arrived and it was a work of art, both aesthetically and taste. Grilled Meatloaf (I opted for the Marsala gravy, a great decision) over wonderful garlic mash, with a side of perfectly prepared green beans. My only complaint about it, was that I loved the touch of crispy onion straws on top, but there were entirely too many and it distracted from all of the rest of the great flavors. Still, I have to rank it as the best meatloaf I've ever eaten (taking the spot from Silk City). It also paired really well with my Lagunitas Coffee Stout.

My friend ordered the Crab cakes and was really pleased with them, even showing me that they were mostly crab than filler. 

Overall, it was a fantastic experience. The only thing keeping it from a 5 star in my eyes is the price. If money is no object, it's a great place to spend some time and get a great meal.

If I hit the lottery or find wealthy , generous friends, I'll certainly be back.",2016-02-26 03:06:01
dpdbMDcxij7UP9INTJziZA,OLGQ7alK4VKl3YdQk6UF5g,wUnLSg_GKfEIQ5CQQ770_g,5.0,4,0,5,"I don't know how long I've been saying that if the world was ending or if I was dying, the first thing I'd do is rush to Vetri. Thankfully, neither scenario happened, and I was privileged to finally dine there last night. 

With that being said, I obviously preemptively put Vetri Cucina on a pedestal surrounded with unrealistic hype. I had butterflies the moments leading up to my visit of combined sheer giddiness and nerves, that I would somehow be let done. I'm ecstatic to report that my dining experience at Vetri was one of the top dining experiences of my lifetime, and I found it to be truly everything everyone says it is, and more. 

Upon entry to the restaurant, I was actually a little uncertain. The hallway was narrow, and I had to walk through a crowd to get to the hostess stand. That literally was the lowlight of the evening, and that's not even horrible. Every aspect of the evening was stellar from there-on-out. 

Where to begin? Well, to start, I wish I was taking notes. Our server was so knowledgeable that I wish I could've written down everything he said about the food and the wine. The wine paring was extraordinary from the thorough to description to the actual pairing. I had the six-pour pairing and I'd absolutely recommend going that route. I didn't view the actual list until after the meal, I didn't realize that they literally listed the wines and dishes they paired with on the page. This is a great keepsake, and guide for my own future pairings. 

After our aperol spritz, we started with a few ""snacks"" and a vegetable crudités platter for the table. We passed the veggies and helped ourselves to the snacks from the center of the table. Our next course, after the bread, was our antipasti. I didn't realize the plate in front of me was my tuna crudo, and mine alone. Theoretically, a group could share and pass everything. We did, to some extent, however we mostly ate the plate in front of us. Based on specific wine pairings, this does make sense.  

Taking a step back, before our tasting journey began, our server gave us some time to discuss the menu and our preferences. I was told to ""not be shy"" if there was something I really wanted to try. While the tasting menu had the element of surprise at every course, the meal was centered around that initial conversation with the server. From just looking at the menu, there were a few standouts that I simply needed to try. 

After the antipasti- we moved on to multiple rounds of pasta. Mamma mia! The swiss chard gnocchi with brown butter was one of the most exquisite things I've ever eaten in my entire life. The gnocchi melted in my mouth as the flavor of the brown butter sauce lingered. This was served with the tortellini with truffle sauce that would've been a knockout on its own. I received the mafaldini with lamb shank ragu as my second pasta course. This was my must-have, and while delicious, the gnocchi still takes the cake. Special shout out to the delectable seafood in the tonnarelli al Frutti di mare that I sampled for one of the other plates

At this point in the meal, I was starting to hurt, however there was no looking back. No food down, no food left behind. Of course, I had to sample the next round of bread that came out- the sourdough. No regrets either. 

I rallied in time for our secondi; in my case, the milk fed veal with asparagus- yet another standout from my initial menu review. I've said this before about veal, however, we have a new winner. This was the BEST veal I've had in my life. We had two different preparations of this tender, tender meat. One was more tender and filet-like, the other was delectably fattier with a slight crisp. There was a dollop of sauce, however I preferred the veal in its own juices. 

Finally, we reached dessert status. Based on our groups eagerness to try everything, our server ended up bringing us one of each dessert option. The pistachio flan was placed in front of me, and the pistachio that oozed out of the flan upon dipping my fork was a highlight. We literally based the plates around the table and it was great to try a little of everything. I hit crazy status when the little pastry tray was placed in the center. Did I need to try one of everything? Probably not, but when at Vetri, you try to eat it all. 

While the food was phenomenal, the staff added to the entire experience. Aside from our fantastic server, the team work and collaboration of guest service was apparent. We had so many people interacting with us throughout the meal that were aiming to please and perfectly harmonized with the actions of their colleagues. 

I was smiling on the outside and smiling on the inside. This meal is a true highlight in my culinary life.  So, I'm so thrilled the world isn't ending and I'm not dying. While I've checked a major item off my bucket list, it's only left me with the taste for more of the finer Vetri Cucina dining experience.",2018-06-21 17:52:08

What the heck?! This hotel is UHMAZING!!! WAAAAYYYY better than the other ones I physically saw while there.  The complaints that people expressed worried me a little but the MOMENT I stepped into the hotel, all of that went away.   The staff was on point and the place was beautiful, trendy and a breath of fresh air!  I have ZERO complaints and believe me, I'm no push over. either its good or bad and the Q&C is on top of their game.  Shout out to Michael (Concierge) & Lonny who both went above and beyond! Tip them!

The room: It was perfect for our 4 night stay.  Sufficient space, very clean and NEW, in a great location. 

Bathroom shower (addressing other reviews that almost kept me from booking Q&C): Like some said, the shower in my room had a separation glass (no door).  If you stand outside the shower, you feel a very, very light spray but nothing serious at all.  I put a towel on the floor near the shower (just in case) and it didn't even get wet.  I love that they have the shower gel, shampoo, conditioner dispenser on the wall.  The gel was so great that I now am searching to buy it.  I NEED IT IN MY LIFE!

Bathroom toilet (addressing other reviews that almost kept me from booking Q&C): It is very close to the tissue but it didn't bother me at all, seriously... I'd rather it be close to me then have to lift my bum to reach for it.    I loved the bathroom and felt right at home.  Plenty of towels and robes were provided. 

The BED: Very comfortable with cute lights attached to the headboard for reading etc. NOTE: The ironing board is below your bed.

The lighting: I had no issues with it.  Ample light came into the room.. Mind you, I do my makeup and need good lighting otherwise I'd be pissed.

When I saw they added the vehicle back for sale I got in touch with Tony Mirabella. He let me know he lowered the reserve and that If I wanted the vehicle I could send him a deposit and he would close the auction.

Before I sent the deposit I expressed some concern since I was unable to go and see the vehicle in person. On the phone Tony went out of his way to assure me he was a ""reputable dealer"" and that I would be ""happy with the vehicle"". I thought it prudent to send him a quick email which spelled out that if the vehicle didn't match the description that I would receive my deposit back within 30 days.

After sending the deposit I immediately scheduled an independent inspector to go and check out the vehicle. Tony passed me off to another employee to get the inspection scheduled and after a couple of weeks they were able to retrieve the vehicle from another auction and make it available for inspection.

The inspector was to review paint, interior, and quality of maintenance. They also perform a test drive however for some reason that day the vehicle wasn't able to be driven. In any case the inspection report came back with photos and a narrative that indicated poor color match and door jam and fender mis alignment. An airbox that was stuffed with leaves and greasy hand prints on the interior door (Light Gray Interior).

When I got back in touch with Tony to let him know I would like my deposit back he initially wasn't available. Then after several weeks he was ""slammed since getting home"" and that he would ""get to it next week"".

After a week or so I followed up again and he asked me the address where to send the refund.After another week or so I followed up again and he asked for a copy of the inspection report.

After another week or so and on regular intervals I've followed up with him and their office through email, text, and phone calls. I have been ducked and dodged with no answers except a request to not leave a negative review and ""I'll follow up with Tony"".

My deposit was on the magnitude of thousands of dollars which as of now it seems I'll have to file a small claims suit in order to recoup. Since i'm out of state I'll have to pay an attorney to stand on my behalf.

Long story short, I would exercise caution if you plan to purchase a vehicle from them.

Your experience may vary but after some research I've found this may be a typical experience.",2022-01-18 17:39:47

Hi Stacey .. Since you stated you read all the messages on YELP.. I also wanted to let the whole world know when they use your services.. they will receive the following responses .. 

IF I, the consumer is dissatisfied with your service 
-I am sorry that you are not satisfied with the shipment that you processed and does not understand something 
-I am sorry that you did not understand the GLS option you processed such as why are there so many charges it is clearly stated in the terms and conditions that you agreed to that there was going to be charges for the duties and taxes so I am sorry that you did not read these, 

don't you think it's rude for you to constantly refer to your ""terms and conditions"" all the time 
-unfortunately no it is not rude to refer to the terms and conditions as that is why they are there for you to read and agree to before the shipment is processed? 

I've voice my opinion on your rep Nikki H. how she also copy and paste BOLD in RED responses back to me 
-we always reply in red after your questions that way you can see them if you like I will be happy to change the color for you and yes we bold things from time to time to point our what you need to see. 

You as a VP, has offered no response to that situation or offered even the slightest apology or state you will look into it, but then I've notice you've done nothing but the same exact thing 
-what would you like me to apologies for, so far no one here has done anything wrong. 

How are you and your reps so RUDE to consumers? Please refer to your YELP reviews as one also mentions you 
-yes I have read them and most of what is listed is due to the shipper such as yourself not reading about the shipping option that they processed? 

Why don't you find out why there are so many fee's. It was 1 box, 1 gift box
 -It is not up to IPS to find out what the fees are going to be that is on the shipper to contact customs in the country you are shipping to if you want to know what those fees are going to be. 

Why don't you offer assistance OR ideas to help get those fee's lowered 
-it is not up to IPS to work with customs to get those fees lowered, IPS does not work with or for customs, do I need to make my gift           prices lowered it is up to you on what you list for the value of the items?

You will be ""more than happy to find out what the return shipping cost will be for your package""
-yes you said that you wanted the package to be returned to you in the states so I will be happy to look into what the rate is going to be to return it to you in the states  

You guys have had my package more than 1 month.. OH calendar days, you guys took my payment, took forever to get my package there, is trying to take more money and now you'll be ""more than happy""
 -Unfortunately GLS is a non time definite shipment due to booking with cargo planes 

I get how GLS does business now. Take the money, take the time to get it there by the slowest means of delivery, Take more money and more money then states you agreed to the ""terms and conditions"" 
-You are the one that processed the order online, you were the one that processed the order with GLS, and yes it is one of the slower options.",2018-10-24 20:33:49

Last week (still under the care of Pet Doctor for bladder stones) I called the office first thing in the morning because I noticed my dog was having issues peeing and I could tell he was in pain. My vet was on vacation so I left a message to have one of the other vets to call me. The person that took this message was told that it's an emergency, I asked when she thought I would get a call back and she said after lunch. I asked her that if at all possible to have someone call ASAP because I was very worried that something was wrong. This receptionist has always been very rude and my last encounter with her I reported to the office manager Doreen and even told her that this front desk receptionist is a liability. 
The receptionist (Joana I believe is her name) never relaid the message as an emergency so almost a whole week has gone by and today the doctor called me in the evening. 

I'm actually grateful to Pet Doctors complete incompetence because that forced me to get multiple opinions and find another vet.  My dogs breeder's vet (who lives abroad) reviewed the records and told me he does not see any stones and that the urinalysis contradicts the stone theory also. I also sent these same records to a family friend vet in Mexico City who echoed the same, that he didn't see any stones. I scheduled an urgent appointment with a vet that was recommended to me, they stayed after hours to do an ultrasound and their own evaluation, this vet confirmed that my dog does NOT have any stones and mentioned that surgery would NOT help, what he needs is to have his bladder flushed out because he has ""sand"" that hasn't turned into stones yet. We were able to schedule this procedure for the next day and now my dog is doing great. My vet will also be testing the sand to see what the cause is, so we can avoid any future issues. 

If this was a human this sort of care would be complete malpractice.  I would not recommend anyone to take their pet here, I don't know how my dog was misdiagnosed unless it's the techs that are looking over all the lab results and x-rays.

The office manager actually had the nerve to say that the special diet dissolved the 4 large stones that my dog was diagnosed with. In less than a month??? Maybe, except the fact that what the other three vets reviewed was the original records taken by pet doctor, so it was the same records that Dr. Ferrel used to diagnose the 4 large stones. 

And just to be certain I asked my new vet for an ultrasound, new x-Ray and a repeat of all lab work. Obviously this cost me a lot $$$ but now I have very detailed records and know that my dog is in excellent hands.",2020-08-27 03:12:16

It's a disaster, and I've already encouraged everyone I know to NOT go here.  I'm in a wedding party and we got our dresses here.  The saleswoman was pleasant enough while we tried on different styles, but copped an attitude when we asked if it was possible to see a dress in the color that the bride was choosing because ""whatever is on the rack is what we have, we can't have a dress in every color.""  Oooookay.  Then when we were measured, we weren't allowed to see what she was writing down since we could theoretically then go somewhere else and give them our measurements to order the dress.  What she didn't tell one of the girls was that her measurements put her into ""plus size"" and she was going to have to pay $20 extra - they saved that for when she called during the ""trunk show"" to place her order.  Charming, right?  That's not even the worst of it.

When they sent us our paperwork to sign and mail back, since we ordered through the trunk show on the phone, one of the girls saw that they had the wrong color so she called right away to say ""Hey, this color is wrong, please make sure the dress is right.""  They assured her that it was fixed, no problem.  The bride called a couple times to double check that they'd caught the mistake before ordering, and they told her it was fine.  She even stopped in and asked them to go check the folder, and they came out and told her it was right.  Then everyone's dresses came in except for Girl X, and the bride called AGAIN.  Do you know what they said?  They admitted that they ordered the wrong dress.  They had lied repeatedly, not only over the phone, but to her FACE.  When the bride had a bit of a freakout, they told her not to worry and that they had ordered a new, correct dress, and that it would be in ""in time, because we can do alterations in two weeks.""  What would make them possibly think that any of us want to deal with them after this?  Not to mention, they didn't correct the mistake until after our dresses came in (in the right color).  They didn't catch it back in the spring and fix it then, when it was brought to their attention.  They waited until midsummer.  

We've all picked up our dresses, finally, and none of us are ever going back.  I've never experienced such unprofessional behavior.  As others have said, they gossip, they stand around, they ignore customers, and when I tried on the dress when I picked it up I saw a bridal gown in a heap in a hallway, just lying on the floor.  Of course, all of this pales when you consider that they thought lying to customers over and over wasn't a problem.  

Save yourself the aggravation and go to any other salon, where you won't deal with dishonest, unprofessional, offensive salespeople.",2013-09-06 23:58:38

I'm not a huge fan of working out, but living in South Tampa, there's a ton of opportunities. After hearing horror stories about Crossfit, it really was the last place I planned on going, until a friend convinced me otherwise. 

I went to a few Crossfit gyms in South Tampa; One was great but was too expensive; at another gym, the coach paid no attention to what I was doing and trust me, I will hurt myself before I ask for help...stupid, I know; the last gym I tried was really cliquish and no one said a word to me, which made me feel pretty uncomfortable, considering they were talking to each other a lot. 

Finally, a work colleague forced me to try Crossfit Ybor. I've heard the ""This one is different"" line before, but against all judgment, I went. 

Surprisingly, when I walked in the door, 3-4 people introduced themselves within 5 minutes of me being there. They showed me the warmup and got me set up to do the workout. The coach knew I was a new guy, so he showed me, very carefully, how to do the workout for the day and put me on a scaled workout, so I wouldn't injure myself. 

I've been going for a few months now and I'm doing great! Although the workouts are still tough for me (and I usually finish last), I've lost 3"" off my stomach and put 3"" on my shoulders. I get nutrition advice, the coaches are very attentive and make sure that I'm always working out with correct form and ensuring I have the proper weight (they don't let you lift too heavy if you're not ready for it). 

The gym throws social events!! WHAT?!?! It's not always about working out! They have weekends where they bring in margarita machines and beer and you socialize while learning about aspects of fitness. I've never been to a gym that had parties IN the gym.

But let's be honest...the main reason I go is the people! They're like a family! We go drinking together, volunteer together, watch movies together...it really is a lot like a family. 

I live very close to other Crossfit gyms (i mean, one of them is 500 feet from my front door), but I choose to drive to Crossfit Ybor. They're affordable, friendly and you get a hell of a workout. 

This is the first time in my life that I enjoy working out!!!",2014-05-30 20:47:54

When they delivered the chaise it was damaged leaning to the side, their response not to replace it but to use the warranty and fix it, this is a new piece they brought to me damaged and I can only use the warranty . So now I have a chaise that's still leaning but they did fix it go figure. Ottoman ripped at seems 3 months after having it, they replaced it through warranty. Ripped again 1 month after that, their now trying to fix it, said they sent parts to my home but I didn't receive them I thought I had them since I had 2 bags but they were the microwave parts. Also the couch is peeling in the creases only 1 year after having it. They sent someone out and said they don't cover that but they told me when purchasing they cover anything! Hmmm. Now to the dishwasher there was a center piece that broke because the plate was not attaching to it. They had to fix that, it takes them so long to fix stuff at least 2 different appointments meaning money lost for me cause I have to take off work. They just left fixing microwave and dishwasher, they said I need to rinse my dishes. Well what it's a $1600 dishwasher are u kidding me. It mildewed all my dishes. I keep telling them it's not drying or cleaning my dishes, they keep saying it's working. I also told the technition and supervisor that came to my house, I shouldn't have to rinse any dishes by hand and the tech said the sales ppl will tell you anything to buy it. The thing is I did my research I clean houses and the better arms and sprayers on dishwashers get stuff clean without rinsing. They said they turned up the heat it's good to go. I waited till cycle was over and I rinsed my dishes also and it's still not working. I called them back to see if they would exchange my item, they said no Only Volunteer repossession or return 30 days after purchase. Wow that's a way to treat your customers. Are you kidding me!

I went to the one in Warrington a year or two ago and I enjoyed my experience there on a not-so-busy morning, with attentive wait staff. This time, not so much! I probably won't be back in a rush. The food was decently good. The service was another story.

We got a spread of items. The salted caramel waffle, cinnamon bun pancakes, a side of pork roll, iced coffee, s'mores hot chocolate, the roadhouse bacon stack grilled cheese, the low country shrimp hash bowl, and the bourbon walnut banana pancake. Most of the food items were great. The cinnamon bun pancakes were true to their name, but were incredibly sweet from far too much icing on top. I still enjoyed them after scraping off most of the icing. The low country hash bowl was excellent minus the fact that they didn't poach the egg properly and the yolk was solid on the inside. I enjoyed the roadhouse bacon stack but there were too many onions and not enough bacon.

Even the things that I wished would be improved, I did not bother to ask the wait staff. This was because they were not attentive at ALL! The waitress didn't check on us often. She passed us many times as we tried to get her attention when she walked by, but she didn't see us. Even the people who were dressed very formally (which I believe to be managers) did not stop to check on us! There were 3 people who seemed to be managers - man with a tablet, and two women. The man with the tablet was exceptionally annoying, because he was just walking around staring at tables with his tablet in his hand. Not once did any of the ""managers"" ask us how we were enjoying our meal, nor did they notice when we tried to flag them down! The man with the tablet kept walking as he was too focused on his tablet/staring at tables. Even some of the wait staff didn't seem to be crosstrained. A young gentleman spent my entire meal walking up and down the aisle and the only thing he did was set a table when one party left. No interaction with customers. I understand that it was busy, but given the sheer AMOUNT of staff, customer service and attentiveness was lacking severely. May not come back for this reason.",2019-07-05 12:23:20

1) they are super weird and aggressive about payment. Once the doctor discussed the treatment plan with me, a man in a suit came into the exam room to explain the pricing to me. It just felt very ...invasive? Confrontational? They wouldn't do the treatment until I paid and I had to leave the exam room to do that. That's not usually how dental practices do things, you usually pay at the end for services performed. For some reason my insurance did not cover most of what they were doing so it was a big sum of money. 

2) The doctor and dental assistant seemed to be annoyed with me asking a lot of questions before and after my procedure. I left not really knowing what my full recovery time would look like, and just a sheet of paper with instructions that were not that helpful, especially because they were for wisdom tooth extraction which is not what I had done.

3) I am in a great deal of pain and don't feel like they warned me at all about what to expect. They said if I had the procedure done yesterday I'd be able to get on my flight the next day (work trip) but am in so much pain I had to postpone the flight. I might have decided on a different course of treatment had I understood how much pain and swelling I would have. This goes back to not taking the time to really explain the recovery process to me. Now I have to get on a flight tomorrow for a work trip and spend a conference looking like a chipmunk and slurring my words. 

4) This is supposed to be a 24 hour dentist. They have someone on call. I called around 8pm because I was in excruciating pain and wanted to know if that was normal. No one answered. I left a message. It's now 9am the next day.. the practice is now open, even and I haven't received a call back. Unacceptable. 

I haven't recovered yet from the procedure so I can't yet tell if they did a good job or if I'm going to have any complications. So, I'll update this review with that o

UPDATE:

It is now about 5 weeks later. I started off recovering well, and they even squeezed me in for a follow up when my faced swelled up. 

However a few days ago I started to have intense pain in the rear of my mouth. I was away for Thanksgiving and saw a local dentist to make sure I didn't have an infection. They didn't find anything. So I made an appointment to be seen as soon as I return, tomorrow morning, because I'm still in intense pain. CCED just called me and told me I can't see anyone besides my original oral surgeon even though my pain is likely unrelated to the tooth i had extracted a few weeks ago. The person who did my extraction is only in on Fridays and Saturdays which means they want me to wait a week to be seen. When I'm in excruciating pain. So, this is not an emergency dentist. Be forewarned.

The other reason I am lowering my review is that after I left my initial review I was confronted by their office manager when I came in for a follow up about my review. They wanted to explain themselves and wanted me to change my review. It was very awkward because i was nervous my quality of care would be impacted by my review. After my appointment the office manager texted me again, asking me to reconsider my review. It made me uncomfortable.",2018-11-24 20:47:44

Ristorante Pesto takes you back to the days of classic Italian meals from classy corner restaurants. In a true Italian family way, you come in to the warmest welcome, great smells comes from the kitchen, and a nice glass of vino being poured.

Let's just say that if you live in the Philadelphia area and have not come in during the past 25 years that they have been right on Broad Street, what in the name of everything holy haven't you?

This isn't fancy-pants not-real-Italian gourmet food. The is high-end classic (and 'certified') Italian like your grandmother (I'm assuming everyone has an Italian grandmother, don't you?) made Sundays (and Mondays, and Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, and Thursdays, and Fridays - plus twice on Saturdays) that even once you are full you cannot stop tried just a little more.

We came in after a fun day in Center City reacquainting ourselves with the city, we were more than hungry and needed a real good meal. We started with the Burrata and prosciutto and the misto appetizer along with pasta fagoli for three of us.  Concetta  came out with a small taste of eggplant, spinach, and ricotta cheese in a rose sauce that we couldn't stop wiping the plate up with the crusty Italian bread.

For main entrees, the youngest likes her clams and while she's gotten used to Maine steamers, she dug right in to the little necks with the perfect garlic and wine sauce that she mopped up with the bread. The two older kids got chicken Parma and, a special for the night, shrimp, clams, mussels, and fish over squid ink linguine with a slightly spicy red sauce. Let's just say the plates didn't need cleaning afterward. 

My wife wanted gnocchi and the chicken piccatta, but knew better and shared the gnocchi with the entire table. The gnocchi were little pillows in a nicely seasoned rose sauce, not too creamy and not too spiced. Her chicken was thin and just the way it should be for an Italian dish. My wife said she could eat it every day.

My dish was the night's main fish special and one of my favorites to get at an Italian restaurant. Branzino is a true test of the skills of the chef to make it come out flakes and moist, and not over cooled and rubbery. Tonight it was spot on with a little crab and shrimp as stuffing. Done to perfection, the branzino was the best dish of the night, in my estimation.

So, if you can't guess by now, Ristorante Pesto is your home for that South Philly Italian dinner you've been searching for - even if you need to come 6 hours for it.",2017-01-16 02:09:14

Possibly some time in the '80s, except then everything wouldn't be so flaked and cracked and falling apart.

It was a last minute splurge, since it was close to where I needed to be, and I didn't have anywhere else to go. I figured, why not? Was it expensive? Sure. Sure it was incredibly, overly expensive. I bet it is very hard to NOT have super over priced rooms there. I knew this before I went in. I made my peace.

I had a single bed, single jacuzzi room in the Polynesian suite. The hallway had a nice Polynesian theme, with trees and a volcano moulded by the elevators. Low ceilings, which I non-sarcastically, actually do like.
Then I checked into my room.
The room was... fine. Small, with a crappy mural and what was suppose to be, I can only assume, the front of a lopsided boat coming from behind the bed. I don't entirely understand what they were going for with that. The bed had some nice pillars and fancy sides, but was IT suppose to be a boat? Then why the front of another boat behind it? It didn't really make sense.

The sheets were so rough I was bestowed with abrasions upon my midsection. But at least they were completely, boringly white, with only a tiny slash of a little decorative sheet which went along with the decor of the room. It really helped to make me feel entirely out of place.

The bathtub/jacuzzi was better. Situated in fake rocks, when you turn it on a bit of rock above fills up and eventually starts pouring into the tub. Not high or nice enough to be a sort of waterfall or shower type thing, but enjoyable enough to look at, as it fills. The roar is a bit deafening, especially since you cannot turn the volume on the television up past a certain point, but it's fine. Actually, when the jacuzzi was on, I was trying to watch a movie, but the jets were just so loud that I could either do one or the other. The tub also seemed to have a faulty plug and would continuously drain no matter what.
I had the perception that the jacuzzi would be more like a hot tub, but it was not. The water is whatever temperature you make it, and considering that it is a huge tub you have to fill with a hot and cold tap, it's a bit difficult to get the water just right. I filled it up with hot and a touch of cold, only to find it chilled easily. I decreased water and added more hot, but at that volume I really should have just rerun the entire bath. Still, it was fairly relaxing. I should have, perhaps, dumped in the small bottle of body wash provided, to experience some bubbles. That would have been a delightful time.

I did eat food and drink whilst sitting in the tub, which was rather relaxing, all things considered. I also quite liked the red ""sex light"" over the tub. I was alone, but they reminded me that this is, possibly, a place that people could use to ""have a good time.""

I have, at one time, stayed in whatever theme the room with the igloo is. The snowy peaks by the jacuzzi were very well worn. I believe there was a statue of an animal whose head was threatening to cave in.
I think, perhaps, these theme rooms could do with a makeover. Don't ditch them altogether (although you may want to reconsider the ""truck"" theme), but spruce them up some. It could be an exciting thing, for children and the like.",2015-12-24 16:31:09

Our first trip to Tavern was a subpar experience and I wrote a review with 2 out of 5 stars. After my earlier review was published, I was contacted by the restaurant's manager to talk about our dismal experience and offered for us to return to try them again. 

We went again on a Saturday night and this time sat outside. It was a lovely evening, and our server was very friendly and approachable. For entrees, we got the seafood trio and the pork steak. Our server was very flexible and worked with us to switch out one of the fish options to a shrimp and he even made recommendations of sauce to go on it (which were spot on)! The pork steak was certainly one of the most tender I've had and huge portion too! Being a foodie, I enquired about it's preparation and our friendly server happily shared the recipe with me!

Our experience tonight was very different and I'm inclined to believe that our encounter the previous time was just an anomaly. As one of the newcomers to the CWE, they are certainly working hard on customer experience. We were very satisfied with our meal and our wonderful server certainly made the night more enjoyable too. As such, I've adjusted my review to 4 out of 5 stars! We'll certainly be back again!

_____________________________________________________
Earlier review (2 out of 5 stars)
We were highly anticipating trying this new addition to Central West End but unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype and is rather disappointing for a foodie. 

The atmosphere is abuzz as it's new and is hopping on a Saturday night. It has a great vibe and I love the decor, upscale rustic contemporary with a unpretentious feel. 

To start we ordered the server-recommended Lobster Potstickers. There was hardly any lobster taste to it. The potstickers were fried, and they were sitting in a pool of hoisin-based sauce which took away any hint of lobster there may have been. At $15, this was a big let down. For entrees, we got the Chicken Saltimbocca and the other dish highly recommended by our server, the Barramundi fish prepared as ""Blackened"". First, the chicken was pretty good, it was breaded, rolled up and sliced, served on risotto. The barramundi was a major disappointment. At $38 for a fish, it should wow me. I got the ""blackened"" preparation which was seasoned with paprika and salt. It was served on a bed of homemade ""blackened"" linguine in a red pepper cream sauce. The fish was fresh, but other than that, the seasoning and preparation was nothing to write home about. The pasta was housemade with a good texture and bite, but again, other than that, the sauce was average. Certainly not worth the price tag.

The service was a little lacking, may be because it's Saturday night, but shouldn't that just mean that everyone tries a little harder. Our server came across somewhat pushy, she promoted only the most expensive items on the menu. The only positive was that the drink she highly recommended tasted awful and she readily took it back to switch for a wine. Unfortunately it still showed up on the bill and I had to ask to have it removed. 

I have no qualms when it comes to paying a higher price for good food. The prices are certainly in the expensive range for STL. It's pricier than Elaia or Blood and Sand, but the quality of the food is only worth half the price. More like cheesecake factory. I guess I'll be popping Tums all tonight....",2015-12-13 04:04:08

It's is located in a complex with plenty of parking space. We love the lobby decor as it felt like a theme park. They have huge 3D cutout posters for your victory poses at the end for each room.

There are four rooms running currently. The manager at the location however recommended that we do the ""Unknown"" room and I (Cici, of course) being a scaredy cat ask if there's live actors in the room. I do have to say I was sort of ""tricked"" as I anticipated just a small scare at the end but lets just say I felt like I was in the Saw movie (I sincerely apologize to the game master that to bear my high pitched scream throughout the game. I would've much rather make slime). We were joined by one newbie to escape rooms but she was a lot braver than I was so I was glad that there was another set of eyes to check for the creepy darkness that pretty much surrounded us at all times. This room was a bit peculiar in the setting of an escape room. It felt more like an immersed movie and you were part of it like a victim just waiting for what will happen next. There's no ""hint"" or ""clue"" that will be given. What you need will be given to you based on how much further you are into the game and the whole goal of the game is that you'll be able to escape so even till the end we don't even know how much time we had left but we lived! I was so happy to see the light at the end of the tunnel and that big smile on the owner's face as he greeted us at the door.

We also tried their ""Bank Heist"" game.  As always, we always love when the story already started prior to entering the room.  We were led to a set design that looked like a bank building and the game master debriefed us there.  But as thieves it only made sense to enter through the alley.  The teller windows looked quite authentic along with other props you would see in a bank.  We were stumped on one of the props since we haven't seen it used in recent days anymore at a bank but was able to figure it out quickly with a clue.  One suggestion I would make is to have some items refurbished as they are pretty worn out by now from the previous game plays.  The puzzles were on point and easy to follow.  We always enjoy the surprise factor by their set design and this room did it again.  With just the two of us, we successfully completed our mission and escaped with some loot.  It's definitely a fun room and I would think kids would particularly enjoy the room for some unique aspects of the puzzles.  If you love spy movies and want to channel your inner ""James Bond"" and show off some of your ""007"" moves, this is your room!

The Last room we tried was ""Mayan Tomb"". We were led by our gamemaster to the front of a temple looking structure and our storyline was played for us on the TV.  As we entered the Mayan Tomb, we immediately felt immersed!  The set design, lighting, and music all felt like we've entered an Indiana Jones movie.  As we made our way deeper into the tomb, new ""wow"" moment of discoveries were made.  This room doesn't have any locks so if you are a tech room lover, you will love it in here.  We did encounter one puzzle that the gamemaster had informed us to be careful with in terms of maneuvering it.  I feel like that particular puzzle could break easily as it's quite easy to be ""hard"" on it when time is of the essence.  It would be great if they can improve the puzzle somehow so that the focus can be on solving it versus caring for its condition.  Other than that, we were once again ""satisfied"" by the quality and gameplay at The Great Escape Challenge!  We escaped with just the two of us with ample time to spare.  This room was quite spacious, so having a group in there would be a lot of fun as well although some puzzles are easier with less people than more and the design was quite linear.

cViOVSK0YXoeOYWy7Tcjyw,HhbzZ0jwY0nP3XpFUh3I7w,QBiNLoutKIgS6lzGks-50A,4.0,7,0,2,"I recently stayed at the Bilmar for 4 nights on a long-overdue vacation w/ my husband. My overall impression of the Bilmar is a good one: friendly, easy-going, attentive services from the front desk associates to the wait staff in the hotel restaurant. Everyone was interested in making sure that if we needed directions to anything or an additional service at the hotel, we were taken care of.  For example, we arrived 5 hours before check in. They offered to hold our bags til the room was ready and head out to the beach to get some sun while we waited. We both changed and were walking out the door when a guest attendant flagged us down and told us a room was available on the first floor if we wanted it. Very accommodating.

The location is unbeatable in my opinion. I came wanting a hotel right on the beach so no car or bus service was necessary and that's what I got. Located on Treasure Island right at a very busy intersection, the Bilmar is on the gulf side and the beach was literally right outside the sliding glass doors of my room. Late July-early August is considered the off-season because it's rather hot, but that meant we had the beach pretty much to ourselves and cabanas were readily available. It was terrific.

As far as the hotel itself, it is a 50s resort on the exterior that was recently renovated in 2006. That meant I wasn't afraid to sleep on the sheets and the bathroom area was nice and new. There was also a minifridge and microwave which was handy for storing cold beverages and snacks. The room was pretty spacious and we were on the first floor. The advantage to this was that we could walk out onto the beach. The disadvantage is that people could walk directly by your room. If you don't mind this, and we didn't, it was ideal. I'd give it about 3 stars for cleanliness. All the surfaces you'd want to touch were clean, but there was some dust behind the headboard and under the tables, a few dead bugs here and there (I mean ants, which are part of the Florida experience, to be honest). They are extremely generous w/ the towels and I didn't ask for them to come clean the room while we were there, so I'd say for two people it's ample.

Bazzie's, the restaurant/bar by one of the pools was not so clean. We had the breakfast buffet one morning on the late side and the eggs were literally rubber and full of holes, the tables weren't exactly the cleanest, but the waiter was nice and attentive. We didn't go back there. Sloppy Joe's, the restaurant attached to the south end of the hotel was great. Cheap drinks, nice staff, great location right off the beach, and pretty tasty food. Silverware wasn't clean but it seems like I'm finding that more and more. I stuck w/ finger food there just to be on the safe side. The pina coladas were really tasty and you cannot beat a $3 margarita, EVER.

More about the location: a Walgreen's directly across the street w/ liquor store attached (a plus); little local Italian restaurant just across the street and around the corner called Gigi's (a big plus--one of those places that retains a 70s interior and has a few aquariums); and Ricky T's Grille (adjacent to Walgreen's) that served a terrific breakfast til noon and had a wonderful staff of locals who made you feel at home (also a big plus). The beach trolley runs the length of Gulf Blvd. so if you want to explore the other beaches to the north or south, you just hop on from in front of Sloppy Joe's or Walgreen's depending on the direction. This was a huge help since we didn't rent a car there. The buses are extremely reliable as far as time is concerned and makes a car kind of pointless unless you have specific things you want to see not serviced by a bus route.

Overall, a great place to stay for a reasonable rate. I booked at $110 per night for a double room right on the beach through Orbitz. I highly recommend researching prices and deals all over the internet before resorting to booking through the hotel. I wouldn't say it is the most romantic place depending on what you're looking for. Good for young families on a budget as well as college students and young couples in that price range also. I'm not sure what the nightlife is like, seemed very quiet during the week, but busy on Saturday despite the off-season. Let me say if you want a lot of amenities, if you want multiple on-site dining options, or if you expect a high level of luxury, you probably shouldn't stay here. Try the Tradewinds just down the street. If you're looking for a cheap, reliable, comfortable, calm beach vacation, try the Bilmar.",2007-08-05 17:16:52
khC0HPmah4jyvK1UC3hfTg,3DbhIc6Xtn9JFYGEQV8aVQ,SwRwejZcoethTZunN6SACA,1.0,3,1,1,"The behavior of this salon is childish and disgusting to say the least. I went in with the hopes of getting my dark brown hair dyed to a platinum blonde color (which I know is a challenge to do in one appointment) and scheduled a consultation with my friend beforehand so I would know what to expect. After talking with a stylist, I was notified that it would not get to the desired color. She then suggested we go for a darker ash blonde color. Upon asking her what it would look like she showed me a picture and I agreed that it was a good match with what I wanted.
Leaving my appointment, I had nothing close to what I was promised in the picture. I walked out with partial blonde highlights when I had wanted my whole head dyed. My friend who had sat in the consultation with me seemed as confused as I was walking out of the salon. I was completely unhappy with my hair but the salon was closed by the time they were done.
The following day I called the salon to let them know I was extremely unhappy with my hair and they informed me that I could come in for another consultation to see what the next steps would be. I was told that they couldn't do anything for me unless I paid full price for another round of highlights.
This upsetting series of events lead me to write a bad yelp review. After leaving this review, I got a call from the owner, Devon, offering to help (Let it be noted that there was no intention of them helping me before I left the yelp review; that yelp review suddenly gave them incentive). She talked down to me over the duration of the phone call, speaking to me as if the whole situation was my fault and making subtly rude comments like ""Just so you know, I'll be taking notes of this phone call so there are no more miscommunications."" In the end we agreed upon a 25% refund.
A few days later I received a voicemail from Devon with her exact words being ""I was just wondering that since um...I'm giving you back a percentage of the service, you wouldn't mind taking down that yelp review"" (key words being ""since"" and ""wouldn't mind"").
I waited for weeks for a refund that they had no intention of ever giving me. I called multiple times to check in on the status of the refund that I was promised and each time I was told that Devon would call me back. Each time I was disappointed.
Last night I called again and was told that Devon ""was not in the office."" 5 minutes later I received a call from the salon's number from Devon. Upon asking when I should expect my refund, I was told that I would not receive the money until I took the yelp review down. This was not what we had agreed upon and after attempting to express this grievance to the owner, I was cut off. She began to raise her voice at me saying that I shouldn't even be getting a refund because I got what I asked for. At this point I was so infuriated at the behavior of this salon and of the owner herself that I began to raise my voice as well, only to be hung up on mid- sentence.
I tried to give Volume Hair Studio the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe there was a technical issue that ended the call. I thought wrong. I called back and was sent straight to voicemail. Immediately after this, I called on my roommate's phone and they picked up. I again, asked to speak with Devon and was met with the answer ""she's not here."" At this point I was beyond appalled at the childish behavior that was coming from this business. How is it that the owner who I was just on the phone with minutes before is ""not there"" anymore? The woman on the phone explained ""Devon hung up on you because you raised your voice at her.""
DO NOT go to this salon. It is by far the WORST experience I have ever had at any business. Not only was I talked down to, but my phone calls were avoided, I never got the refund I was promised, I hate the way my hair looks, and Volume Hair Studio attempted to bribe me into taking down a yelp review, which is also against Yelp's guidlines. I am utterly and completely disgusted.",2018-11-08 04:34:19
i0_KB-Q-21GEMneeDjWa1Q,nkBpODDjnP-nD9uz1Z4YsA,vufXnNdvRl_Y0wAj_wLzOg,4.0,4,0,1,"I know it took me three months, but I wanted to try everything first before writing it.  I can honestly say I've had about 60% of the menu by now and have not been disappointed by a single thing.  Let me give you some of my favorite's from each.

Starters: If you are looking for something for yourself, the cheesesteak springroll or the mac and cheese would be a good bet.  Both are a good size.  Could be shared, but can definitely be eaten by one person.  The cheesesteak springroll may just blow your mind though.  So hot and juicy and that spicy ketchup is perfect with it.  Now if you're looking to split something, I'd suggest the wings or the memphis nachos.  The nachos are exactly what they sound like and they're outstanding.  The wings are done with a jerk rub and are baked.  The dry rub is great, but don't expect saucy wings that you've had elsewhere. They're a little pricy for my taste, but they're very good.  

Salads: I got a caesar and my fiance has ordered the cobb (picture posted).  Meat of your choice can be added to your salad for a little extra.  I got chicken on the caesar and it was really good.  I don't know if they make the dressing in house, but it was great.

Sandwiches: I highly recommend the Bridget's burger.  It's a big, juicy patty, smothered in melted pepperjack, topped with two thick slices of bacon and this incredible sake-shiitake sauce.  The sauce is a game-changer.  You'll find yourself trying to mop up every last bit of it with your burger as you eat.

Pizza: It's crazy how good these pizzas are.  Probably the best pizzas around and its not even a pizza joint.  The classic margherita pizza has a ton of flavor and is great to split with one other as a meal or a even a bunch of friends as an appetizer.  I also really liked the short rib pizza.  Has a awesome blend of flavors that you probably haven't had on a pizza before.

Entrees:  There are many I still want to try, but if you like jambalaya then get this one.  It's not an enormous portion, but if you had an appetizer or salad it should fill you up.  So much flavor to it.  Great way to warm up on a chilly night.  

Desserts: I've had every single one of them and loved them all.  Bananas Foster is their claim to fame from what I'm told.  Chocolate lava cake is amazing.  Definitely ask about what kind of bread pudding they're serving that week.  My personal favorite is the Jewish apple cake a la mode.  So very warm and the combination of apples, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream is my weakness.  Love it.

I love this place and love taking friends here.  It has a great location, awesome patio seating, and really cool decor inside.  Personally I think, and I think many would agree, Antony is the best bartender in town and he works like every night.  Guys knows everyone's name.  Real friendly staff.  Know a bunch of them by name now.  Love the food.  Love being able to just come and hang out.  A bunch of TVs that can be seen from any seat and they always got the local games on. They also just expanded to serving brunch and open around noon now instead of five.

With that being said, I have a few areas where I think they can improve.  These come from personal experience and hearing from others.  It can get quite loud.  Apparently since they took out the walls from Salaris, there is nothing to absorb sound.  Second, I love the prices of the pizzas, salads, entrees, and desserts but I think the appetizers are a little high in price.  They would really benefit from more starters in the $5-$9 range.  Drinks also are high in price.  I feel like I'm paying $2 too much for each drink.  They could use a few beers in the $3 to $4 range and some mixed drinks in the $5 to $6 range.  That's the only thing deterring me from being here all night Fridays and Saturdays. Would also love some happy hour specials.

Love CH7.  Think it has something to offer for everyone.  Can't recommend it enough.",2011-10-28 18:40:23
D3RT_vycoL8N6p_NdMuILw,rmHikSz-CJIlqo3AJBHBsw,DK98TgLNmIguxMMPGlyb5w,5.0,1,0,0,"For my 100th Review on Yelp, I waited for someplace that was really special. It was a serious tie between Welcome Diner and Cafe Poca Cosa, but I decided to make the later review #101.

This was my second time at Welcome Diner and I loved it just as much as the first visit. Actually, the first time I went here, my car had been broken into at the Gem Show that day. My friends and I were exhausted and traumatized and the Welcome Diner experience took the edge off the whole stressful day.

On my first visit, I had the jackfruit fries...much better than I expected. I'm actually not very adventurous with food and not a big fan of meat substitutes​, but the jackfruit was very good. 

This visit I had the No Way Jose Burger, which was delicious. It was a cross between a good fast food burger (like In and Out, not Burger King) and a gourmet burger. Sometimes the gourmet burgers (like ZinBurger) are so rich, they're like eating dessert. The No Way Jose Burger had good balance. The greens in the side salad we nice and fresh, no icky, over-ripe leaves which can be a problem. 

My friend got the Eggs Benedict which she said was really good. I should have tried the hollandaise sauce but didn't think of it. 

For dessert, we had a Lemon Lavender cookie and a chocolate chip cookie. Both were tasty, not bakery quality but good. The coffee was good. I'm a coffee snob so I was pleased I didn't have the immediate ""yuck"" response to a generic-tasting coffee.

The building is classic Mid-Century Modern and there was a sign outside that said Pie with an arrow pointing to the door. To me, anytime you can go to a restaurant and it's an experience, even if it's not perfect, that's something.

Both times I was here the service was good. I read some other reviews that said the service was spotty. The thing is, this is the antithesis of a corporate restaurant experience so of course, there's going to be some​ inconsistencies. That's the reason why you'd go here, because it's real and authentic. 

My friend that went with me has lived in Tucson for several years and didn't know about it. I'd highly recommend the Welcome Diner because it has that kind of cool factor that makes it memorable. 

And who doesn't love comfort food?",2018-07-12 03:06:51

Stayed at the J-Dub Marriott recently for four nights, one of which was my wedding night! I had originally planned to stay for three nights, but at last minute wanted to add a fourth night and come in earlier. On the phone with Reservations, they said I'd have to change rooms after that first night because of rates or availability or some bull crap, but whatever. However, when I checked in, I was greeted by Danielle who took the time to sort things out and make it so I could stay in the same room the entire time. There was a big line behind me and only two people working the front desk at the time, but Danielle was extremely calm and courteous despite the crowd. 

Danielle hooked me up with a lovely corner room on the 14th floor - not too close to the elevator and not a huge schlep either. The room smelled fresh and clean, had plenty of storage space, love the bathrobes. Used the hair dryer and iron, both were perfectly fine. Liked the shower space but the shower head could use some updating - pretty typical hotel shower offering. The bed - king size- was HEAVEN! Wanted to bring it home! 

On the morning after our wedding, Danielle sent up a bucket of champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries, which the hubs and I thoroughly enjoyed! So sweet of her!

On one particular evening, I needed to find a chill restaurant that could accomodate 8 adults and 2 children, where we could all wear shorts, be loud, and one that offered something other than ""local"" food - not everyone wants fried food and jambalaya nightly, though I was happy with that! The very friendly and helpful concierge suggested several places and then hooked us up with a reservation at the Crescent City Brewhouse, which was perfect for our crowd (great beer, deelish food-I had the crab au gratin, YUM!!).

I wish I had names of everyone I encountered at the J-Dub because truly, everyone was super nice and accomodating. The bellmen, the concierge, the valet guys.. super, super helpful! 

We also experienced the ""missing fresh towels from housekeeping"" on one day, but I called down and the bellman brought them up to me!
 
The hotel is the perfect distance from the crazy, loud quarter. Near to everything including aquarium, coffee shops, Ruby Slipper (YUM-eat breakfast here!) and the quarter. Close to Popeyes for the friend chicken, close to Krystal for the late-night burger run and near enough cheesy giftshops for bottles of water, soda, feather boas and packs of gum.

Thank you to everyone at the JW Marriott for a wonderful experience! I'll absolutely stay here again.",2011-04-23 17:57:26
Stdp_eObFISnbAlsocc1pw,3J1IfbsYGXfw05s_pX-MFQ,cQinLnaT-McXMUKRxq5_UA,4.0,1,0,0,"We discovered Arosso vía Groupon and decided to check it out on a Friday evening. It's not too hard to find and while the parking lot has seen better days, there is plenty of it, so no issues there. 

We were able to snag the last booth! This made us feel very important. I appreciate that the server asked us if we wanted ice in our beverages, as I'm not an ice person and my girlfriend very much is! Nice touch. Our server was brand new but very nice and did just fine. We had a brief misunderstanding when I ordered espresso and got cappuccino, fortunately that issue was rectified right away! 

The menu is absolutely huge and many items on it sound delicious. One could visit daily for a month and not try everything! They even had a sign up about breakfast. 

As for the food itself...we started with the portobello mushroom appetizer. It has cheese and shrimp and...a portobello mushroom underneath all that. Very rich and of course it tasted good. I wish it had 2 portobellos within the dish rather than just 1, there was certainly enough room to accommodate. 

Oh, they do start you out in proper Italian fashion with bread. The difference is that it comes with a delicious garlic dipping sauce. It was addictive and the ramekin ended up completely empty! Bread wasn't bad either, soft inside and slightly crisp, it's almost like it's made for dipping in the garlic. 

Salads were average: mainly iceberg with some shredded carrots, a piece of tomato and cucumber. 

For mains we each had a ribeye cooked the monterosso way, which means smothered in a creamy Gorgonzola sauce and topped with mushroom and crab. I couldn't really taste the crab (I believe it's shredded meat on top?) but the shrimp were nice and big and and the steak was cooked nice and rare as ordered. 

Unfortunately as you can see, the veggies were overcooked. Not a big deal to me as I wasn't going to eat them. But I'd have been disappointed if I wanted them. My girlfriend asked for the Gorgonzola sauce on the side and this did not happen, it came smothered in sauce. However she doesn't like to send food back and she did eat half of her steak.  Next time I'd request it on the side or perhaps try the plain ribeye. Ribeye is a wonderfully flavorful cut and the sauce does make it difficult to trim the fat when you're cutting. Also, this rich cuisine really begs for a cloth napkin, not paper. However extras were provided when requested. 

Cannoli and espresso were both very good, nice sweet filling with a fresh tasting shell. 

We left full and satisfied. While there were some areas of opportunity food and service-wise, it was a solid meal and a good value overall. I'd give 3.5 stars if I could and wouldn't rule out a return in the future. Perhaps with a bottle of wine next time!

wKrFC1wUGJsq5BxsHLZ0kw,jaWsq2mYfaoICFYuBwb3TA,Fl-DBGC_T_im_8CYpv2Fow,1.0,0,0,0,"Ashley Home Furniture has poorly made products, terrible customer service, and most importantly for me, policies that ignore and are negligent to environmental awareness as well as actively contribute to worsening climate change on this planet. Please read to the end.

My experience with Ashley Furniture HomeStore has been, without question, the worst experience with any business I have ever had. Period.

My wife and I bought a new sofa, the ""Dorsten Slate Model"", in October of 2018. It came with a 1 year warranty from Ashley and we purchased an additional 5 year warranty from Montage Furniture Services, Inc. On 5/7/20, we noticed that the sofa's load system under the seat cushions had broken. This sofa has a webbed system rather than springs, meaning that there is a sewn semi mesh fabric connected to the upholstery. The mesh has sewn eyes that connect to a 1/8"" diameter or smaller rod system towards the back. The rod had snapped, the mesh had torn, and now the sofa was almost unusable. This is after less than two years of regular household use. Nothing was done by us to this sofa other than sitting and lying on it.

I called Ashley on 5/7, I was on hold for nearly an hour, and then hung up on. I called again, and after being bounced around to multiple people and more lengthy holds I was told that I needed to file a claim through Montage Furniture Services. Fine. After filing the claim, I was notified by MFS that a serviceman from Fast Furniture Repair would come to survey the damage. He did about two weeks later, and contacted MFS to notify them that it needed to be reupholstered, and then left. 

Yesterday, 6/3/20, I received a text message from MFS asking to rate my experience. I was under the impression that we were waiting for the repairman to contact us again and schedule a day to repair the sofa. However, apparently it is more cost effective to replace the sofa with another sofa from Ashley Home Furniture instead of order the repair upholstery and have the serviceman fix it. (That tells me a lot about the quality of furniture, btw). I wasn't informed of this, but rather had to call both Ashley and MFS to find this out. 

6/4/20, I received a text message asking when I preferred delivery. I called Ashley Home Furniture and was notified that they would only be delivering the new sofa, and that its my responsibility to get rid of the old sofa. This sofa is damaged and in need of professional repair. I cannot sell it, I cannot give it away. I cannot donate it. Im forced to put it on the curb. This is so unacceptable and irresponsible. I'm basically forced to have this sofa go to a landfill. I will absolutely never ever shop here again. I will actively tell others to not only NOT shop here, but to boycott this company for their egregious policies that and lack of environmental awareness. I am disgusted that the company would rather add trash to a landfill than fix their terrible furniture the right way. 

I am on my way to the store to speak with someone personally. Whenever I call the Ashley HomeFurniture branch at 5151 Citrus Blvd, Harahan LA 70123, I am immediately transferred to a corporate line, where I am on hold for 30 min minimum each time. Pictures are attached of the damaged furniture.

This was fine, it admittedly smelled DELICIOUS! The heavenly scent of garlic perfumed the air from the outside. 

.....

Once inside though.. as a group of 10, we were given a table for 6, and made to fit around it. That was fine, we were a close group, we made it work, except we were bereft of one chair. We let them know that we needed one more, and were assured that they would get it. And we waited.. and waited, after 5 or so minutes, one of our part stood up, walked over to another table, and politely took an empty chair. Problem solved. 

Our table was lit by a singular tea light candle. This place is DARK at night. So even though the table was up by the front, and there are only sheers on the windows it was hard to see the menus - the -4- menus we were given. So several of us took out our cell phones and used our flash light options. 

I had a tree molesting my hair and shoulders every time I shifted even slightly, and I realise that was MY problem because I chose to sit where I sat, with my back against the Window, and not facing the rest of the populace, call it paranoia, but I like to see people. 

I took a walk through the rest of the location, looking at the art, taking in the couples, the groups and enjoying what I saw. It was clear that people were enjoying themselves. And that was great, but when I got to the restroom, and saw that the toilet paper had been ""changed"" but not.. the new roll was just sitting on top of the spent roll. It annoyed me that I had to change the toilet paper roll in this ""upscale' place.  Yes, I know it was likely a patron who'd done this previous to my visit, but they should have someone checking on that occasionally. 

The service was Ok. I wouldn't say it was top notch, because when I order dressing on the side, that's what I expect, instead my salad was drenched in dressing. And the $7.00 salad I got, was what I would get for $4.00 at any other location, but the flavours were good even if the portions were small.

I opted to try a local bank in hopes of a friendly community environment.  To my dismay it has been the complete opposite experience.  

In the few mere months I have been with Nevada State Bank I not I only have received the worst customer service from the tellers but up to the branch manager.  

This bank operates as if it were locked in the 1970's.  Here is a small non inclusive list to follow:

1.  Check deposits made via the ATM are non obtainable for days.  Not one penny is available upon deposit.  No other bank has ever functioned in such an archaic form.

2.  Cash deposits....that's right cash deposits made in the ATM do not even post in an immediate form.

3.  My first check deposit via the ATM was held for several days which caused fees to be charged to my account due to pending payments.  Assuming a simple phone call would remedy this oddity turned into an elongated ordeal.  I started with the bottom, a bank teller, and I was told ""our"" bank does not and will not reverse any fees even though the deposit was placed in my account prior to the withdrawals.  Then I was reluctantly referred to Erin, the assistant manager who set up my account, and she couldn't have been a more condescendingly rude.  ""We will not remove the fees"". She so arrogantly stated.  Off to the next step the branch manager....a week later she returned a call to me stating she had been to busy to contact me sooner.  After a long rude conversation she finally agreed to only remove half of the fees.  I conceded as my time was more valuable than wasting another breath with her.

4.  Not, only two weeks later I deposited $1,320.00 in cash in their ATM.  All was fine until three days later the deposit completely disappeared from my account.  Thus, leading into a full day of panic and disputes.  Fortunately, I had documentation of the deposit.  They had an ATM technician come out and review the records and determined that my deposit was valid.  Two days later the money reappeared in my account.  


I will be moving onward to a more reputable institution.  My advise to all that may consider this bank is....DON'T!!!!!!",2013-12-08 06:32:04
TyQ9UNOHIe0FEIw2DS8epg,ZJ8Eb3AvlQ8zftxLwAoSvg,_RS9siA3jqE18TsBDKDDew,1.0,9,0,0,"I got a card in the mail that said my modem was out of date and needed to be updated with a new one, so I decided that I would swap out the modem and since I don't use my cable box in my bedroom or their phone service I would try save money on my astronomical Comcast bill. I get to the place and the store is setup like a cell phone store after a ""short"" 25 minute wait I told the rep how my bill was high and I was returning one box and canceling the phone service and needed a new modem, I thought he would of said something like, "" let's see what we can do about this bill"" like they used to do but he just mumbled ok and gave me the new modem. As he was trying to dismiss me quickly to get back to his conversation I said "" well how much will  be coming off my bill?"" he said roughly 30 bucks so I asked what my current internet speed was and how much to upgrade well 20 bucks a month later he upgraded me to 105 Mbps so in my head I'm thinking I'm still saving 10 dollars a month...............BIG MISTAKE

I get the modem home plug it in and get it up and running and do a speed test, I'm not even getting the speeds that I was getting with my old modem call up support and they tell me they are gonna send out a tech. (Really big inconvenience since I'm a self employed it contractor) I pick the 5-7pm time slot and the day of I get a call at 2pm that the tech is 5-10 minutes away I asked him what happened to 5-7 and he said ""well I'm in the area now"" good thing I was relatively close because I wanted the problem fixed now. When tech gets to my house he said ""look your getting Internet"" I told him I know but not at the speed I should be getting it at. He then said "" oh I don't know anything about a speed test"" and I had to show their own tech how to login to their modem to do a speed test. After a while he switched out the modem and got me up to 30 Mbps and basically said I should just be happy with that because he doesn't usually see speeds higher then that. I asked him to check the cable connection in the underground access panel out front and he told me that he can't because that's a different department! 

Moral of this story I'm paying for 105 Mbps and not even getting close to that and was told I should be fine with that...........There is a very good reason why Comcast always scores incredibly low on customer service rankings, it is because they deserve to! So many points of failure in my recent dealings with them that I can't believe they are still in business. So now what? do I call so I can be majorly Inconvenienced again (how many unknowlegable techs can they send out)  or just wait until next month to switch?",2015-08-29 05:51:15
4YUR_AFG8-pK-OQ89HB6SQ,OSLwWwrOixYMJemibpKXww,dBUlDcC7RZaqamswEm9Amw,1.0,4,0,1,"The dental side is ridiculous(I have never went to the medical). They are good for pulling teeth and that is it. I got a filling from them and regretted it about two weeks later. The tooth only gave me a bit of pain before I got the filling. Then I got the filling and two and a half week later it started hurting me horribly..pain so bad it felt like the tooth was infected. They also did not ask me what material to use for the filling and used the metal stuff...which I think was a factor..I read that they can cause pain. It was a poor choice on the dentist part. And it was NOT ok that they did not ask me if I was okay with paying the 5 to 10$ more for the other stuff(tooth colored)

I wasted 160-80$ (this was on a 40% sliding fee) on a tooth that probably did not need a filling!!!

I went back after 3 weeks..the dentist said I had a sinus infection(as far as I know they do not cause swelling around a tooth), gave me antibiotics...they did NOT help. Maybe a bit because I do believe there was an infection forming because of the tooth....but once the antibiotics were gone the pain came back. It kept swelling and hurting. Then the tooth in front of it was having issues. They did(what they said was a temporary filling, according to another dentist...it was permanent! It was really close to the root and apparently I now need a root canal. I found this out from another dentist. Community Health Alliance told me that I needed to go to another dentist because they weren't sure). 

I went there because the first filling I got, part of it fell out while I was brushing my teeth. 
I now have a hole in my tooth...the issue...they will charge me to fix it..because it was a lil over a year ago. I got it in July of 2014(near the 25th-30th). I went in there and was told they have a 1 yr guarantee on fillings. That is a HUGE red flag. I paid once and had nothing but issues with this tooth since they worked on it. I take care of my teeth, I brush and floss after almost every meal and I do not eat candy unless I can brush my teeth. Of course this is after realizing I was not taking care of them(I brushed, but it does nothing without flossing, for the last couple of years I have been trying my hardest to take good care of them!!!! FLOSS PEOPLE!).
They should have fixed the tooth long ago..I think the entire issue started because the filling was not done properly to begin with. I think they needed to seal it and that was why I was getting the infections. 
One dentist did not understand the pain...and seemed not to believe me. I did not care for pain meds. 

PAIN IS A SIGN OF AN INFECTION!! Antibiotics helped the swelling go away and the pain almost goes away. She was not thinking right. I had a few teeth that got pulled..they hurt the worst because they were infected...
Now I have a tooth with a hole put there by a dentist that can't even own up to a mistake and charge too much from the start. It is suppose to be cheaper then other places...even with a sliding fee it is still expensive! 
I have wasted far too much money there already and will not give them a penny more. I stupidly got xrays and ended up not ever getting more teeth fixed there because of the pain from the first filling(and the second did not go well either...I did not pay for it though)..it was a waste of money!!!

SO get a filling at own risk. I do not remember the dentist name. I have seen almost all the ones that work there. They do not seem to try and keep you with one dentist..(walk ins are understandable..but actual appointments...I would get different ones...it makes it harder...)..



 (I got a filling from another dentist, they do a free dentist day every year... they used the tooth colored stuff and he said it almost needed a root canal..that was done Nov. 4 2014, the tooth is fine now...it gives me NO issues)..

I now plan to use the temporary stuff(from the store) until I can afford to get it fixed by a good dentist.",2015-11-25 19:28:18
QMZYD_Q0hWHdXp2v1KcQOw,yNiowknnVglktoo2AY5WuQ,HoKH4Rk7wHfVT-60aYIYwA,1.0,0,0,0,"Since there are so few restaraunts in Vail, I decided to give this place another chance.  They disappointed as usual.  

When we arrived, there was no hostess at the front.  We waited 10-15 minutes before someone noticed us and seated us.  This might be understandable if they were busy, but they weren't.  There were only 4 other tables seated in this very large restaurant.  I hoped to sit at one of the tables close to the garage area, so that my kids could look at the cars.  Even though the place was nearly empty, they didn't even offer us one of those tables.

The table that we were Sat at was greasy and appeared not to have been wiped down at all.  Even though our waitress only had one other table than us, the service was extremely slow.  It was 20-30 minutes for us to even order drinks.   When the food finally came it was mediocre.  It was bland and unseasoned.  My wife ordered a burger and said that it was  actually decent.  

There wascpne thing I noticed that showed just how little the servers cared about doing their jobs. Despite how slow it was (3 servers for 4 tables) , they couldn't even bother to bus the tables when people left the restaurant.  There were a couple of tables that were unbussed when we first sat down, and the staff didn't even bus them until we  were leaving ( we were there almost 2 hours due to the  extremely slow  service).   Additionally, when I used the restroom it was absolutely filthy. It appeared to me that it had been days since the men's restroom was cleaned.

The level of service here is completely unacceptable.  During the entire time I was there I never saw a single person that appeared to be a manager.  I used to work several service industry jobs when I was younger, and this level of service would be unacceptable in even the worst places where I worked.  

I love in Vail, and there is a lack of bars as well as of decent places to eat.  I really want this place to succeed and be good, but it is horrible.  I have to think that the owner makes money in other industries and just operates this place as a loss / tax write off.  There is no other explanation of why this place is still open.

This place sucks.  Avoid at all costs.",2016-04-01 12:37:18
a0n4yUmWHgMza7Hm1HJ5pQ,wXdbkFZsfDR7utJvbWElyA,5Pd7mzZpuojdFCUDbQvsIQ,3.0,6,1,5,"The service at the drive thru window (including the speaker system) were good. Even though we went for a quick lunch, there was no wait as we pulled up, placed our order, and pulled around to pay at the window.  There was minimal interaction in handling the food exchange and payment transaction, but I've yet to find a place that is 100% efficient on eliminating some sort of risk.  But this was as good as most places I've tried during the close down.

Although listed with an Indianapolis address, this is right along SR 67 near the southwest corner of I-465.  So, it's closer to Camby.

I had enjoyed KFC in my pre-Yelp days when I wasn't as aware of supporting small and independent businesses.  I was in the mood for some fried chicken and didn't feel like making it myself or going to the other place in my town that is known for their chicken.  So, I talked my wife into taking me to this closest location of KFC.

As I said earlier, the staff were friendly, the lot seemed pretty clean, and I liked that the speaker system worked well enough that we were able to understand our conversation with the staff inside.  We ordered a couple individual meals.  I got an original 2-pc with dark meat.  My wife ordered an extra crispy with light meat.  We both got the biscuits and mashed potatoes as our side.  There was minimal wait after we pulled around to pay.

It took about ten minutes to get home.  By then, my wife's extra crispy had become soggy, though the inside was a little dry.  My original seemed cooked properly with just a bit of crunch and with moist chicken inside.  The only problem is that the breading on the chicken was very bland (my wife's was quite spicy comparatively). We both liked our sides.  Were the mashed potatoes spectacular?  No, but for fast food, they were tasty, had a nice consistency, and the gravy was smooth and didn't overwhelm the potatoes.  

I would have liked to give this place a better rating because of the service and sides, but considering this place is supposed to specialize in chicken, I have to say we were both disappointed in the flavor (and for her, the consistency).  

I rarely rate fast food restaurants particularly when they are chains.  But this one would have gotten a better rating for the service, but a lower rating based upon the chicken.  I probably won't rush back due to that discrepancy between food and service.  But if you are in a hurry, it's a nice option to consider.  Just be careful pulling out of the parking lot since that is one busy stretch of highway.

I figured I had nothing to lose and I made an appointment. Walking in, the store is really cute and quaint. It smells really good and the only reason that I knew that is a consignment shop is because I had done some homework ahead of time.  The saleswoman explained that all of the dresses are professionally cleaned before they make it to the store and that they are either sample dresses or wedding dresses worn once. They assigned a sales woman to help me and she assisted zipping my dress up. They brought out some nice dresses and unfortunately I didn't find anything that was exactly what I wanted but I did find a Jim Hjelm piece that was almost perfect except that it was a little bit too tight. I could have had it let out but I knew that it was not the One. At least I got the opportunity to try on a Jim Hjelm dress original retail $5000. The store offers a $25 fee to hold a dress. The fee is non-refundable but if you really do like the dress it does make sense to put it on hold. There were some great brands at Sabrina Ann bridal. They carried everything from $5,000 dresses all the way down to $200 dresses original price tag. Everything seem to be about 1/2 off retail or slightly more than half off retail. Overall it was a good experience and I'm glad that I checked it out. Unfortunately they didn't have what I needed but if they did, it would have been a great deal. I may go back to the store to buy the veil because they also sell veils, bridal sashes, bridal jackets, and even shoes. I don't see the sense in paying full price for a veil that I'm only going to wear for an hour or so. The Bridal jewelry that they had was also notable. They don't sell bridesmaids dresses but they do sell mother of the bride dresses. The saleswoman also told me that they have prom dresses downstairs. I should bring my prom dress for resale.  I don't know much about labels but here are some that I saw at Sabrina Ann: Daniel Mota $6200 retail selling for $2500.  Jim Hjelm $3,800 selling for $1750.

7f1_cxqC2pqu5YPVAhVEWA,VOLtCgxNG1NozQkGY_kJkg,2ZqezqDwEO0uuhlX0E54TQ,1.0,3,1,1,"This Wyndham property should be given a rating of 0-1 stars. One star because the lights go on the staff is friendly. The halls are dirty, the elevator is  very dirty, and the bath towels are small. They clean the room and do not replace the towels and paper goods with the proper amounts. This was not a cheap hotel. 

For the amount this hotel charges, do yourself a big favor and find a hotel in the area, spending a little more money so that you have an enjoyable stay in Nawlins!

The walls are so thin you can hear your neighbor guests talking in their rooms. You can hear ""everything"" from the adjacent rooms. The first day the room cleanup was skipped and not made up until we pointed it out to the manager Dashone, a very nice person who appears to have his hands tied by the owner (He did his very best). The second night we got back at 5 pm to get ready for a nice dinner and again the room had not been cleaned up.

One of the most DISGUSTING issues with this property is that on Sunday morning, I went down to the in house coffee shop to purchase coffee and 2 bagels. They sell bagels with butter or cream cheese. The person working there had 100% NO Utensils at all, and I had to use my fingers (I'm a health professional) to break the stick butter at the counter and then had to take to my room and we had to use our fingers to put it on the bagels. The butter I had to break at the counter was then put back in the fridge at the coffee counter and probably served to someone else. (A major health violation issue I will assume).  When I asked the girl at the coffee counter she informed me that the owner keeps everything locked up until a manager arrives??? THIS IS DISGUSTING!!!!   I then asked the front desk for a knife and they had none either.  How does this hotel have the ""audacity"" to sell bagels and butter/cream cheese, charge for it and not provide any knifes to spread the butter???  I felt like I was paying to stay at a ""no-frills"" camp ground site with no amenities. 

Then one morning to use the men's room at 9am in the lobby and it's locked? I was told that due to the large amount of homeless people? Why is there no security guard for the guests?

Then the final Monday morning we were there, I went to get coffee at the same counter and it was CLOSED????    I was told the staff member didn't show up?? I asked if anyone else can sell coffee and was told No.... so, then I had to go up, get my jacket, and walk to a different hotel to get coffee.  What kind of customer service is this??  

A guest picks a hotel based on amenities and other factors. Is it now easy to see that their website and info is basically all fraudulent as so much was not true

DO NOT PICK this hotel and this property's ratings should be lowered to as low as possible.",2019-11-07 20:05:49
MH2574mb46u5B6sul8IgHA,xGS_mlHcCUipSKXrHk6CGw,Wl2RXj5BDbDWZZAh48RXJA,1.0,3,1,1,"I get that art can be controversial. I get that not every piece of art is for everyone. 

My beef with the Talus Dome isn't about the sculpture itself. Sure I think it's a bit silly looking, but whatever. My opinion doesn't determine what's good art and what's bad art. And I don't know what it represents or what, but I could put out some general guesses, like snow, or mountains or the juxtaposition of Edmonton's blue collar roots and art culture, or whatever. How I feel and what I think about this piece isn't the issue.

My problem with the Talus Dome is the placement. Why would anyone think it is a smart move to place a piece of giant, and distracting public art on the Quesnell Bridge on one of the busiest roads in Edmonton. 

Texting, applying making, playing candy crush, aren't these forms of  distracted driving? Well yes, but we can also add the Talus Dome, a giant piece of blinding art to this list. The silver balls on this sculpture are 
reflective, so depending on when you're driving and where you're looking you'll need to shield your eyes. It's distracting and it's dangerous for drivers and pedestrians. I wonder how many people have said, ''but officer I couldn't help it, that shiny silver thing was distracting me."" 

The placement of the art isn't good for either drivers on the Whitemud or pedestrians in the River Valley. There isn't any kind of place where you can stop and look at this piece of art as a driver. You can't exactly stop on the Whitemud...unless it's rush hour (Thank You! I'm Here All Night). You can drive down to Fox Drive where you can see the full statue, but again not really a good place to stop unless you park under the overpass. And then if you do, you still need to cross Fox Drive to stand on an overpass embankment to look at some silver balls. What?

Look I'm not okay with damaging public art, as someone did recently. It just means that the art will need to be repaired, at a cost to the taxpayers. But maybe that vandalism is a sign, not that we should get rid of public art, but that we should move it to a place where it can be enjoy by people, and not be distracting to drivers, which is dangerous for everyone. Public Art is for the people right? So let's move this sculpture to a place where it can be enjoyed by people without being dangerous. 

It's either that or we need to start putting outrageous and weird art sculptures on every overpass and bridge in Edmonton, so it won't just be the Whitemud and Quesnell Bridge with distracting art. Then it'll just be visitors who are distracted by shiny silver balls and my next proposal for badly placed public art in Edmonton; a giant statue of Wolverine on the Anthony Henday overpass at Gateway Boulevard.",2015-10-02 19:56:16
Ttdyvxfat9U_QWamnB-MZA,SASvlR4YZ4sJyGcj8ODONQ,LJSKXR-syjNUD3GCNYyqtg,1.0,3,0,0,"I went to the Movie Tavern in a great mood, excited to celebrate my son's birthday, and left completely aggravated and frustrated with the terrible experience I had caused by the poor service provided at Movie Tavern Exton. We went to the 8:30 showing of Spiderman last night. My family ordered food and drinks to be brought to us at 9:00 PM. My son later decided to add a sandwich to his order. No problem. I placed the order and indicated that I would pick it up at 9:30. Our food arrived promptly at 9:00, but no drinks. We began eating and watching the movie. At 9:20 we flagged down a staff member to inquire about our drinks. We were told that they would go and get them right away. At 9:28 I got up to retrieve my son's sandwich that I ordered, noting that our drinks still had not arrived. I went to the ticket taker and asked the woman working there where I should go to pick up food that I had ordered online. She told me to go to the bar. I went to the bar and stood in the line there for 25 minutes! When I finally got the front of the line, the gentleman there told me that he would not have my food and directed me back to the ticket taker to retrieve my food. I went back to the ticket taker, where the same woman who I originally spoke to was still standing. I told her, that she had directed me to stand in the line at the bar 25 minutes ago and I was told that she would have the food that I had been waiting for all of this time. She then motioned to a shelf directly behind her and said, ""Oh, it's right there. You can get it."" Completely irritated that I had just wasted such a significant amount of time missing the movie for no reason, I took my food and went back to the theater where my family was sitting. Our drinks had STILL not arrived. I went back out into the hall and flagged down a staff member and inquired why our drinks that were supposed to be brought to us at 9:00 had still not been given to us at the current time of 9:50. She asked me what we ordered. I told her that we had placed an order of 1 lemonade, 1  Pepsi, and 2 Dr. Pepper sodas. The reply I received was, oh, that's because we don't have any more Dr. Pepper. I was in complete disbelief. ""So because you don't have anymore Dr. Pepper, you were not going to update us at all and you were just not going to bring us anything?"" She then offered to replace the Dr. Pepper's with something else. She asked me to wait in the hall while she retrieved the drinks that we had been waiting for. By the time I returned to my seat in the theater, I had missed 40 minutes of the movie. The storyline was completely lost to me. I cannot believe that I paid to see a movie that I had to miss 40 minutes of because of the dismissive and inattentive attitude of the staff at Movie Tavern Exton. Missing 40 minutes of a 2 hour movie because of the staff's shortcomings is absurd. Based on this experience, I would recommend that people stay far away from Movie Tavern, Exton for fear that you might completely waste your money on not seeing a movie like I experienced during my visit.",2021-12-20 22:03:26
UdQFVs1DRNuguovOrCTBSg,0dAclgpNIO90XCNwplkhmw,ZYoKsoyfRuxqJPwsKtzqFQ,4.0,1,0,1,"I'll just put upfront that I'm not a huge donut fan.  Never have been and I don't ever crave donuts.  However I'm married to a donut fiend, so here I am, at least once a week picking up a box of sugary fried breads. 

 I am a bagel fan and theirs are good enough with a nice variety of fresh tasting schmears available.  Sometimes we get a bag of day olds for lox at home (Trader Joe's has an incredible pastrami style lox!), but if I'm eating in house I get a fresh one.  
They are semi known for their #notacronut, and of course we've tried a few.  I'm not a fan, theirs is dense and doughy and have none of the light buttery thin layered flakiness that is the joy of a croissant, and they are pricy at over $3 a pop.  If available the cronut holes are better, somehow lighter and less raw doughy, and they used to be 3 for a buck, but now they are a buck a piece.  

Depending on the time of day you arrive they have the usual assortment of cake/basic/old-fashioned/bar donuts along with an occasional cookie, muffin, or macaron offering.  They only bake the night before/early morning and not throughout the day (like Donut Bistro) so once they are out, they are out.  However if there is a specific donut you want, you can call ahead and they will set some aside for you. I've nibbled a donut/cronut/fritter from my husband's selection over the years and never have been compelled to finish a whole donut or get one of my own, until Rounds.  They make a lemon poppyseed old-fashioned that is just delicious.  I still only manage to eat half with my morning coffee, but it's sweet, crunchy, tender, and lightly lemony.  vaguely reminds me of a lemon bundt cake.  I believe they are slightly more pricy than Doughboys or Donut Bistro, but not too expensive.  Customer service has always been friendly for us, but if you order an espresso drink it can take some time so don't be in a rush.  

Only thing I've had that was downright terrible was a cinnamon roll thingy with bacon and maple drizzle.  It tasted like white bread with sugar syrup.  No discernible maple (the icing drizzle was very light, but the entire thing was enrobed with plain glaze) and no cinnamony flavor either.  The bacon they used was one of the grossest things I've ever eaten.  It tasted so bad, it looked like bacon but it didn't taste like bacon, it tasted like what dog food smells like.  It seems like they often put out experimental items, and that's cool that they have fun and test new things, this just was one of the bad ones.",2015-06-06 13:01:58

Food is out of this world, sophisticated, yet satisfying, and eminently French without stuffiness...but still somehow super elegant and refined.  Philadelphia is noted for its BYOB scene, and Bibou may be the best of that set.

Service is attentive with a touch of haughtiness, which is welcomed at a fine dining establishment.  You can tell the wait staff have been in their positions for a long time.

I did a long run this afternoon (7 miles) to make room for the feast, and this is what I had:

1) Baguette w/ butter (4/5) -- I'm not a bread dude, since I'm an absolute health nut, but one has to sample the baguette at a French restaurant.  The butter really stood out here

2) East coast oysters with mignonette sauce (5/5) -- Perfectly presented, flavorful and briny but controlled with the mignonette.  This was a special

3) Endive salad (5/5) -- I love salads, and this was outstanding.  The light dressing knocked out any bitterness that one might associate with endives, which were thankfully chopped and sprinkled with walnut shavings and a touch of raisins which raised this salad to the fine-dining level

4) Celery and chestnut soup (5/5) -- Fantastic winter-soup.  My partner had this and my beastliness came to the fore and I had to order a portion for myself.  The celery base was complemented with earl-gray tea and pomegranate seeds.  Extremely creative, yet maintained that comfort-food satisfaction that one craves

5) Swordfish with crispy polenta and Brussels Sprouts (5/5) -- Swordfish was the best I've ever had.  It was cooked so perfectly, and the crispy polenta and brussels sprouts made the whole composition come together in a melt-in-your-mouth joy parade

6) Cheese plate (5/5) -- I opted for the cheese plate over some of the other standout desserts such as the Floating Island, which are also outstanding but I felt I needed a dose of fromage.  There was a blue cheese, morbier, and the creamiest selles sue cher.  It was served with an apricot spread, sliced green apple, small salad verte, and another round of baguette (they're small).  Absolutely fantastic

The dessert is served with complimentary macaroons and meringues a la classic French-restaurant style.  I had some excellent decaf to boot.

The owner/head chef visited our table and made us feel extremely welcome, and my water or wine glasses were never left empty.  The crowd is sophisticated and put together.  

Reservations are a must, as Bibou fills up fast.  I am concerned about the new ""Family-style"" restaurant they're opening up in RIttenhouse, since at Bibou you get the head chef cooking and leading up the meals.  I realize he'll have to do double duty at least for a while, although his kitchen seems to run seamlessly so I imagine a high level of quality will be maintained.  The concern is will the IT factor and creativity/comfort balance somehow be diminished even a hair.

Cash-only policy is somewhat antiquated.",2013-11-14 02:20:32
Xe1-Ak558QXild3KVE88VA,YFCERzj1Ay6jEW5wjUZHrA,tukxgoQNUKql3gYy39yZ9A,1.0,13,0,2,"I have never used a cleaning service - and I work a ton of hours these days. I thought it was a valuable investment and to treat myself. While I wanted a clean house, my goal was piece of mind, stress relief and having my place back in order - so I can come home and relax at the end of a day. Groupon had an offer for cleaning at a great price, so I bought two. When I first tried to schedule my appointment, I rec'd an auto text, not a call. It said I will be with you shortly. I waited, and nothing. I reached out again and again. I then heard back and the owner said she was just married. Okay, cool! No worries, lets get this on track. Then I kept getting texts, no calls. I mean, I've NEVER had a cleaning service to my house and this kind of freaked me out. But I moved forward. They crew was supposed to come late morning one day. We confirmed by text. They arrived 1.5-2 hours EARLY! I had people at the house, the dog wasn't away, and I had a conference call for work. Instead of stress relief this caused more stress. The crew cleaned in a frenzy and did a decent job. They claimed to have washed down the baseboards - yet the entire hall wasn't touched. They did a stellar job on the bathroom and kitchen - so that was a super positive. They did give a slight hassle about windows. The groupon clearly said ""indoor windows"" not outside. Yet, they caused a fuss about this. But at end of this day things were cool. I enjoyed having a house cleaner than I could have gotten it. 

Then I scheduled my next visit. Again, no phone calls from owner, she only would text. Again, not the service I prefer but I was forced to roll with it. This time the owner knew I had to be somewhere at given time and it was important to be there at 9am. By 9:17am the crew arrived. The cleaning was for 2 hours. They rushed and did it so I could get to my 11am, but in doing so they left so much to be desired. The person who came the first time took the downstairs, she was pretty good. But she gave me a hastle about dishes and putting them in washer. In fact they didn't want to even pick up dirty dishes that were here and there in house. Why bother coming then? They then agreed to do this after a hastle and communication with their owner. They made it clear this wasn't a service they do, yet their materials didn't exclude this. 

The girl that did the upstairs - she put the bed spread on upside down, and didn't even tuck in corners or make it neat. I asked her to clean up something from floor. The service said ""focus in on specific areas was okay."" I asked to clean up spill on carpet and she didn't do a good job at all. She also didn't even put the toilet paper on the roll in bathroom, and again the hallway baseboards were dusty/dirty. 

At end of visit, which was fast but left some areas for improvement I asked something about windows and they insisted again that they don't even do inside windows. I referenced the specific note on the Groupon that they do. They said something like oh well. 

When they left I could tell the rush job wasn't nearly as good as the first time. I also was again stressed at their lack of timeliness, missing some items and arguing about things they should have made clear in offer. 

For the record, their website says this: 
From ceiling fans to woodwork, we want to make sure we don't miss a spot!On our first visit, we will get down to the nitty-gritty! Some houses are tidier than others, some are messier than others, and some are just dirtier than others. Regardless of the condition, we will spend whatever time necessary to bring your house to a level of superior cleanliness! 

The page I reference says nothing about ""no windows"" doesn't even mention dishes, and if you read the balance of the page, talks about dirty messy jobs. Moving a few cups and dishes or washing a single pan sounds way easier than what most people probably request of them. (Yes, they wouldn't wash the single pan in my sink. It was left on the counter dirty.)

I will say that I am ""sold"" on the benefits of having cleaner come when you are busy at work. I really wanted these folks to work out so I could have them back. I wasn't even going to write a yelp review as maybe they just overbooked. However, when I just walked down the hall, saw dust flying off baseboards and saw state of my upstairs, I decided I should speak up.",2013-03-30 21:02:57

No Joke. 
When I go back to NOLA this is a must for me. 

I'll set the stage:  we were in town for a bachlorette party over Halloween weekend. We all have varying dietary needs and very different meals we enjoy.  So finding restaurants is very difficult for us; however, we all agreed on this one and were able to get a reservation on a Saturday at 11:30 am.

We were the second table to arrive, but we were ready to eat. Unfortunately, they only do Brunch on Sundays, I wish they would do it Saturday as well, so we were confined to their lunch menu and their 5 daily specials.I would've killed for their Bloody Mary after looking at the pictures of it on YELP!  Trust me- we made do. We were here for over 3 hours!  Granted we ordered in courses and ordered waters, then drinks, then another drink, then moved onto bottles of wine and champagne b/c that's how we do. 

Our waiter, Adrian T,  was AMAZEBALLS, he was one of the best waiters we (and we did collectively agree on this) have ever had. My friend even called the manager over to compliment him on how awesome our waiter was. As soon as he walked up he just started laughing and said 'you girls are the perfect table for me' he must've seen our mischievous smiles. 5 Star rating on the waiter!

The Food (see my pix too)
1) Shishitto Peppers- delicious. reminiscent of Nobu. Did I mention delicious? Definitely spicy!
2) Short Ribs- OK my least favorite thing and a VERY small portion size. Not good for sharing-  The pickles; however, were so amazing we ordered the pickle jar to get more of them. Unfortunately, these same pickles didn't come in the pickle jar...which makes no sense!
3) Pickle Jar- Missing what we wanted (read #2) I'd pass on this as it was underwhelming for me, but Veggie Girl  liked it immensely!
4) LOBSTER GNOCCHI aka DUMPLINGS- one of the best dishes I have ever had. The clear winner of the day. Soft and delectable, in a butter sauce, with perfectly poached lobster... I posted the same picture of it on Facebook and my friends in Florida were going bananas over it. Definitely, definitely, definitely get this dish. The surprise to it is that it's accoutrements were Lima Beans and Black Eyed Peas (Fergie, Ferg!  #ohs1t) 
5) Spaghetti with crab meat-very heavy dish, but since we were sharing great for one or two bites. Very tasty as well. 
6) Apple salad with walnuts- Veggie girl loved this, she ate it all
7) Duck Croquettes- Was a special of the day. Came 5 to the order, perfect for sharing. 
8) Shrimp 'n Grits- Smaller portion size, I felt I could've gotten a little bit more 'bang for my buck' on this dish priced around $19. It had 4 shrimp and about a 1/4 of a cup of grits. If this was the only thing I ate I would've still been hungry, but obviously it wasn't.....so I was stuffed to the gills!
9) Hamburger- Hungover girl (which one you ask is that ?)-pretty much all of us to be honest) ordered this to 'settle her stomach'. And that it did!  We all had a little bite of it and all agreed it was very tasty. Even veggie girl tried it :)
10) Pumpkin Ricotta Cheesecake- The 2nd clear winner of the day. Unbelievable in texture, taste, and balance of sweet 'n salty. One fine lady, in our merry group of maids, doesn't eat sweets (Jack Pratt can eat no fat) and she helped herself to a second spoonful b/c she thought it was so amazing. 

Also, they had pictures of foie gras too which is my downfall...didn't see that on the menu and would've loved to have!

There were four of us that ate lunch, one was too hungover to stay and had to go back to the hotel room, our bill was around $100 a head. But we left happy and stuffed! #boom",2013-11-08 19:15:46

When I read the reviews about Angie's cafe I was very excited to try it out and hoped this would be the place we would come to for breakfast on a regular basis.

We got there right when it opened as we have 2 small children and did not want to have to wait a long time for food.  We loved the neighborhood and the kids loved the pond.  The cafe was charming and the staff were very friendly.  The kids got coloring books and even chalk for the side walk.  Our experience was off to an amazing start.  The menu looked good and I even commented that I heard they made home made bread and I would like some with my food.  I ordered the vegetable scramble and my husband ordered the french toast with home fries.  The kids would munch off our plates.

The food came fast.  ""That was fast"" my husband commented to the waitress and we wondered how that could of happened given that our orders should have taken at least 15 minutes if they were cooked fresh.

We soon discovered that the reason it came fast was that the only actual thing cooked fresh was the eggs in the veggie scramble.  The home fries on both our plates were clearly cooked a few days ago and were reheated to order.  The french toast was the same, made days earlier and merely reheated in the microwave, you could tell by the way it was so hard on the corners as it cooled down and eventually turned into four pieces of hard brick resembling crutons.  The home made bread never appeared just regular sliced bread toasted.  I still cannot believe that they would reheat home fries and french toast and especially as we were the only customers there.  They should not do it even if they are slammed.

We both barely ate the food and when we got home we were all hungry.  I wish I had said something, I think I would have if we were not their with the children.  Everything was perfect except the food and that is the only reason you go to a restaurant, sure it is important for the atmosphere and staff to be wonderful but that does not keep customers coming back or recommending it to friends.

Our great search for a breakfast place is still on!",2011-04-02 00:01:56

Wow! My black badge (there is a reason for that; ) friend Michele R gave me the hot tip regarding the talent in the kitchen of this new spot.  She told me that my husband who is a big chorizo fan might find something he liked.  Boy oh boy, did WE!  I knew it would be good, but it was ""Wow"" good! We ordered wayyyy more than necessary but there were so many tempting choices. 

We ordered take-out. Folks, this take-out must be a lot of extra work for our restauranteurs and I for one am always grateful when they do take out correctly; easy on the environment packaging and instructions for serving ours had heating instructions written on the box.  There is a short term parking near the restaurant, but if you call in advance you can probably get ""alley"" service. 

The portions at Ansots are VERY generous.  We easily shared everything we ordered and will probably eat twice from the order. ( I could sit down and eat all of this ;) but I know better and today I am being good)

Love of my life had the Rustic Pork Belly bocadillo. He did give me a little bite. It was served with a blistered sweet pepper.  This dish is both beautiful and delicious.  

I tried the Basque meatballs which numbered SIX!; excellent and swimming in a delicious gravy (and I am not even a meat and gravy kind of girl).  The Chorizo plate, to my astonishment, consists of three whole sausages. with generous amounts of grilled peppers, onions, and lots of excellent quality bread.  The skinny spicy sausage was my favorite but the other two were fantastic. 

Desserts. I am not a big dessert person so when I say it is good, it has to be exceptional.  These were all exceptional.   Rice pudding for me is a comfort food.  A giant serving (enough for two unless it is for me ;) . Hubby got the bread pudding.  This grand  portion is best shared;  tender and rich .  It does not need the toppings but if your sweet tooth loves sweet, you have plenty of topping.   

You probably think that was the end of our order.  Nope. I read that Ellie is the Queen of Kougin Aman and so I just had to order one.  I have no idea what the bar is for this dessert, but I think she must have set it.  First of all it is a work of art.  Cripsy yet buttery and sweet, but not too sweet, pastry, and something sweet and appley inside.",2020-10-31 17:45:19
rX2ZhRa9LyRUSVohQjd_yg,vHc-UrI9yfL_pnnc6nJtyQ,S8TWiMbbBaCNUHbQXOCBNg,5.0,23,7,21,"Wow... Been yelping for quite a while now and I think this is my First ""First to Review""! Does that make this an FFTR? Here goes...

2-D Wok is a lemonade from lemons story! Sometime late last year I lost my beloved 168 Chinese and all of the incredibly authentic flavors Tony and Mr. Lee cooked up in that tiny kitchen. Soon after a Thai place opened and quickly closed, making way for Theresa, Alvila, and Shawn to open 2-D Wok and bring their tasty Taiwanese family recipes to the Biggest Little City! 

Let me start by saying that Taiwanese food isn't Chinese food. It's a totally different cuisine with some really fantastic dishes and flavors you've never experienced if you've never tried it. It's a bit sweeter than Chinese but there are some great sour components to their dishes that set them apart as well. I'm hungry just thinking about it!

When visiting a new restaurant, I'm looking for a menu with offerings unique to the place. Typically it means the cooks are competent, these items will be tasty and interesting, and the classic dishes are going to be the best you've had. This is definitely the case at 2-D Wok. 

After carefully perusing the menu and talking extensively about my love for all Asian cuisines, learning about Taiwanese food and beginning a friendship with this wonderful family, I ordered takeout. They were hesitant to do a takeout order, informing me that some of the items may not be at their peak once I got home. I sincerely appreciated this because it showed their pride in the food and just had me anticipating my first bite even more.

I ordered Mama Lin's Fried Taiwanese Bacon, the housemade spicy pork dumplings, and they offered me a taste of the Guay-Yah Pork. The Taiwanese bacon was pork belly coated in sweet potato starch and fried. The crust was reminiscent of corn flake crust, light, thin, and flavorful but not greasy. They serve it with a plum sugar salt mixture for dipping and the tart plum cuts through the richness. The pork dumplings were tender and delicate, clearly handmade to order and gently coated in a spicy and salty sauce. The Guay-Yah pork was reminiscent of 168's Lion's Head Meatball, an oversized meatball made from a fatty mixture of pork, pork fat, and seasonings, steamed in a rich broth to perfection. This is the Taiwanese equivalent, much more manageable in size and just as delicious. It's really exciting to see this dish available, along with the other two dishes I tried. 

It's dishes like these that get me excited to try many more on this menu. They're still perfecting some things with the food, but everything I ate was enjoyed immensely and my minor criticisms aren't noteworthy. 

This restaurant is a gem and needs to be supported so it can thrive. Reno's ready for this influx of flavors! If you're nervous or unsure, the staff is super helpful and wants you to enjoy everything. And I'll never turn down an invite to eat here so just hit me up!",2015-05-27 04:37:49
SyoiKnju4R5CF7i-UYCDcQ,VFjDTL2rnCvYei33-jILhQ,FTFaEinJgzqY0ZHQMUSpQQ,3.0,0,0,0,"This place gets three stars for their beers. their food and service gets two stars. Yes, beer is that important to me.

Came in this past Saturday for lunch with my parents. The dining area was moderately busy with four sets of tables that we're not occupied and the entire bar area unoccupied. It took the host about ten minutes to seat us as she was running around the restaurant with a phone in hand. Not sure what she was actually doing. I had to get her attention after standing around with my parents for a few minutes. 

After we were seated it took another 10 minutes for someone to come over to take our drink orders. Again, the place wasn't super packed and it seemed like they had more than enough people on staff. My mom and I had the Apricot Wheat and my dad had the Spring Witbier. I've always loved their Apricot Wheat and wanted my mom to taste it. She said it was her favorite beer! It's a light beer with a light apricot finish. Very refreshing. The witbier is unique in that it's very floral with notes of lavender and coriander. After having a sip of my dad's pint I had to get one for myself. It was that good.

The food was subpar. I had the steamed clams and muscles. It didn't taste fresh and didn't smell right. My mom had the grilled thresher shark with risotto and snap peas. The fish was too salty. She didn't finish the fish. The risotto was dry and too al dente. Seemed like it was rushed in cooking then left out for service. The snap peas, on the other hand, were perfectly cooked. They were sweet and lightly cooked with just the right amount of salt. My dad had the seared ahi salad. The salad was your regular spring mix. The ahi was not fresh and off color in the center. Again, heavily salted and didn't go well with the dressing.    

The service was the worst part. It took about ten minutes to get seated in an uncrowded dining room. another ten minutes to have a server take our drink orders. Another server to get us our drinks about five minutes later. Then our initial server to take our orders another ten minutes later. By this time we were done with our first beers. Then it took what seemed like forever to get our food that was brought over by yet another person. We watched two full innings of the Angels vs. Yankees game before we got our food. 

Luckily we were on vacation and weren't in any rush. It just seemed chaotic among the servers. Multiple servers were both serving the outdoor patrons as well as people in the dining room. I could tell multiple table were ignored for long periods of time. The table next to us with a child were waiting for a long time to get some silverware. Thank god for their beers. Oh, and at $4.50 for a pint, very reasonably priced. Ask to taste a beer before buying. They'll happily pour you a small amount to taste.",2012-04-17 03:11:07
dMT3sPzKz9eZbmDeWWNBhg,FzxQM0T333Fw0gAGJaiExw,DZglT5FP5VNDQJU3PuRIHw,3.0,1,2,1,"Reading the other reviews of this place and seeing all the pictures with excited captions, I really thought that this was finally going to be THE place to go with my girlfriend. She is from southern California and has lived in Spain for a little while before, so she has had her fair share or Mexican/Spanish food. I made a reservation all quick-like hoping that this would be the closest thing we would get to authentic Mexican/Spanish cuisine....

....man, were we underwhelmed....

When you initially walk in you ask yourself where they could fit a restaurant. The first thought you get when walking into this place is that there is a bar with a knook and a few tables...thats it (except for the sound of chaos in the background). The chaos, you realize when being led to your table in the oddly large back room, is from the kitchen, cooking like crazy. Why can you hear the kitchen and the sense the chaos so well? Because you have to walk through the area where the waiters pick up their orders to get to your table! Seems like a pretty weird way to orient a restaurant, but its a small building...I give them a pass for that.

Once you get to the table and order your $8 ice-water with tequila, you realize the theme in the place. The decor has a good Mexican-ish flair thats not in your face nor very memorable. The one thing that sticks is the consistent theme of skeletons, which, after consulting my girlfriend, makes sense since the place is named ""The Happy Skeleton"". Cute. What we did find intriguing is the nice looking outdoor seating with the requisite hanging line of incandescent lightbulbs you see nowadays. Its a nice touch and a cool looking area, if not really all that Mexican.

Once the food you ordered (which you happened to do while drinking your iced water-tequila) comes by, the first thing you feel, especially with the enchiladas, is.....thats it? My girlfriend eats relatively small meals, so she was happy with what she got. Me, on the other hand, had to ask myself ""did I order an appetizer?"". Nope! Thats the main course buddy! It took me all of 10 min (with talking of course) to finish the food. Yea, it was somewhat tasty, but not what I was expecting. The mole sauce I got on my enchiladas was bland, if mild. I had better mole at a bar 2 blocks from my apartment...for half the price. After finishing the food I still felt hungry. Not good when you come in starving and expect a tasty feast. I wanted moar.

Since we were both underwhelmed by our entrees (by taste and size), we were lazy and decided to stick around for dessert. MY GOD, was that a good idea! I forget what it was called, but it had mini brownies, (I think) cinnamon ice cream, caramel popcorn, and whipped cream. Push the puffy stuff out of the way and you have a scrumptious concoction that almost makes up for the bland meal and drinks. I was finally somewhat satisfied. CHECK PLEASE!

Overall, it was an underwhelming experience. Not really that authentic of Mexican/Spanish food, but passable for those pastily inclined like me. Take away the high prices and fix the portions and you got yourself a winner. Otherwise your only take aways are a watered down mojito/sangria and the memories of dancing skeletons.",2014-10-23 18:36:21

Let me say first that the biscuits are, ridiculously enough, a revelation. I have had many servings of Southern biscuits, and never really understood what the fuss was about. Now I get it. Light, flaky, just moist enough to whet without sticking to my palate. Astonishing. I could have made a meal of them.
The wait service was extremely attentive, and though I wish our waiter had spoken a bit more slowly, it's possible he was new and just anxious. Over-explaining in a rushed manner is sometimes as bad as under-explaining, but once I asked him to slow down a bit because I had trouble following him, he did immediately. He also kept a very close eye on all the tables, as did every other waiter in the room.
Our reservation was for the very start of brunch; no problem with parking or seating. The restaurant itself has a nice, open feel. Having a visible kitchen is always comforting to me, since I travel so much and am leery of food poisoning. The chefs, likewise, were extremely friendly. All questions were answered forthrightly.
The ""huevos rancheros"" did not look like any we'd ever seen. It was mostly beans and rice (both on the side), with the rest heaped over a tortilla shell. Pretty presentation, but I wouldn't recommend it. The side of bacon was small but absolutely delicious.
I did ask my waiter about the Live Band Louisiana Oysters, since I'd never heard of them. Once I'd convinced him I actually knew all the other oysters on the menu, he was frank and told me that they were popular, but he considered them the least worthy on the menu. Largely because of the oysters, which looked fine, I ordered the top of the line version of their buffet. I should have listened. They were absolutely awful - and this is from someone who's eaten raw oysters all over the world. Our entire party tasted them, and we were shocked that a restaurant of this caliber would serve oysters this bad. Perhaps it's still the oil spill - I hear there are inches of sludge remaining on the bottom of the ocean because of it - but these were dreadful. They were fresh, though - I watched them being shucked.
The charcuterie items were delicious, one and all. I'd particularly recommend the homemade coppa and the ham. The salads were fresh to a fault, and when I mentioned that my wife was allergic to eggs, they actually prepared two of the small wedge salads just for her. As noted, the service was excellent.
Another point in their favor - I picked up half a dozen of the boiled shrimp, but on peeling, found them all to be ""mushy"". I don't know why this happens, but it seems to happen quite often in restaurants. I've only had the problem cooking them at home once, and that was the fault of the shrimp (my bad for choosing them!). I mentioned it to the waiter, who brought over a manager, who looked at them and had them removed. Not just from my plate, but from the entire buffet.
That was impressive, because there'd been a fortune in shrimp sitting there.
The salmon was a bit disappointing, average. The salads were good but not remarkable. We found some of the food combinations strained, as though the chefs were working hard to make their menu ""memorable"". But the Brie with candied figs was excellent, as were all the other cheeses - easily the best ""cheese plate"" in Nashville. 
Another outstanding item was the coffee. We were disappointed that they didn't have espresso, but after one whiff, we forgot our worries and settled in to enjoy what is possibly the best cup of coffee I've had in America. 
Was the buffet worth $30? are the food items worth the tariff? I don't personally think so, but then again, I don't need to know the name of the farmer who grew my vegetables, or the location of the farm my meat came from. And if you want absolutely farm-to-table completely homemade items, I suppose it would be worth it. 
I'd recommend Urban Grub for a business lunch meeting over any of the other upscale spots I can think of here. It's quieter (we got seats by the window, which was smart), and though we found the piped in music annoying (how nice it would be, for once in this town, to have classical music at brunch!), that was a small price to pay.
Speaking of price, yes, it is pricey if you order a few different things - but choose carefully and you won't go wrong.
Would we eat there again? Yes, if we were in the neighborhood. I wouldn't call it ""destination dining"" but it's friendly enough, the food is mostly excellent, the service ditto, the seating comfortable. And honestly, I'd go back for the coffee! We're planning to try it for dinner at some point.

Where I've always felt the food is a bit overpriced and pretentious, I don't mind paying it for the atmosphere (to be blunt: no kids). There are definitely some winners on the menu with lots of options for sharing. I usually always get the wagyu sliders and snapper tacos.

Today, my husband and I decided very last minute to not be bums and go out to celebrate the new year in style.
We made very late reservations as they were booked until 10pm. No problem. 

We were sat immediately and there were quite a few open tables around us. We waited a bit and finally a young woman named Jenna came over and got our drink orders. Not too long after a gentleman came over and greeted us offering to take our drink order. We kindly explained that Jenna had already taken us. But honestly, we didn't care who waited on us.

Jenna was helpful, answering all our questions. It was confusing that their NYE special menu had ala carte prices next to each dish but wasn't offered ala carte. Not anything she could do about it, but super weird.

We ordered a few drinks from the bar, Caesar salad as an appetizer, the burger with fries, and the lamb chops.

The bar drinks were always delivered by someone else, and our salad ""appetizer"" was delivered with my burger. Odd, as we specifically stated it was an appetizer. So I pushed my burger to the side of the table and ate the salad. Big mistake as once I finally was ready to eat it everything was cold and soggy.

At some point my husband had to stop Jenna and ask if his lamb was coming, as he was afraid she forgot to ring it in. Otherwise throughout the entire dinner she never once checked on us. I feel like seeing someone push their plate all the way to the side of the table is a big hint something is wrong. And as a server you always want to check in after your guests have a few bites, right? 

The salad was awesome. We added on the white anchovies (a must!). The homemade croutons and Parmesan crisps were excellent and added some crunch to every bite.

The burger was a bit lackluster. The homemade bun was good, but very soggy. My fault for letting it sit while I ate salad probably. The exotic mushrooms they used were impossible to bite through or chew on the stalks. Their garlic Parmesan fries are always killer, but since they were cold and soggy too - not so much. And I love their homemade ""ranch"".

The lamb chops are VERY small. I wasn't super surprised with an $18 price tag....but still. The presentation was lovely - reminiscent of fancy foodie TV show plating. Gordon Ramsey eat your heart out! My husband said the sauce reminded him of A1 and completely overpowered the lamb. He really liked the sweet potato cake/square thing.

As we were wrapping up Jenna finally stopped by and asked if we wanted dessert and if we were done eating. My husband said he was done, and we both declined dessert. Jenna ended up taking my plate as well, and I was still nibbling on my fries.... Probably for the best honestly, but still.

I don't know if they were understaffed or if she was just ready to get off work, but the service was definitely off. I'm just going to have to stick with the bar and Destiny from here on out (that B better not ever leave).",2020-01-01 07:45:38

The waitress didn't actually seat us just pointed at a table to go to. We sit and she doesn't come take our DRINK order for a good 20 minutes. I wanted a lemonade, but apparently they were out of that, whatever things happen.

Several minutes later, she calls to us saying, ""I just need to get these people their drinks and I'll be right back to take your order.""...she doesn't come back for another 15-20 minutes. We eventually get our drinks and she finally takes our order. In which case they were also out of mashed potatoes, she thinks...didn't actually check.

We look around and people who came in well after us were promptly seated and their orders were taken and received their food and drinks fairly quickly which was obviously annoying as we've now been here at least half an our with nothing. Also, another table with a larger group was offered bread with all smiles and light banter and still we got nothing....getting kinda mad at this point. 

Now I've been sitting here for an HOUR and she finally comes back and says, ""I don't remember which one of you ordered the red beans, but we're out of them."" My problem wasn't with the fact that they didn't have them, but the fact that she waited half an hour after I ordered to tell me that and offers me butter beans instead because ""they're better anyway."" Now I'm more annoyed.

Another 10 minutes pass and we finally get our food. The mac and cheese was cold, butter beans I didn't really want were luke warm, but at least the chicken was hot... -__-

The flavors of everything were ok, but nothing I would scream about...

My last straw was when the waiter, after all this time of being lackadaisical, decides she will PROMPTLY bring us the check like she is rushing us out of her, reaches over us to put it on the table, and runs over to the other table with big smiles and is asking if they needed anything else or would like dessert. Bitch, I actually wanted to order dessert, but seeing as I couldn't get the same treatment as others, I didn't get any...soooo you didn't make as much money as you could have on the meals and you certainly weren't getting a tip. Sorry, not sorry. It's a shame too because I had a wad of cash in my pocket and I'm ALWAYS willing to tip 25% or more. 

I don't know her name, because she didn't speak more than 4 lines of dialogue to us, but to the owners, she ruined our experience here and lost you some money.",2016-04-29 22:42:04
0X5qMttufdTTupFeRCUjCw,oi2d76l2Kto0VIDrC_0S6g,1KVJv7Srbxcy5vzs-pnjVg,1.0,0,0,0,"We had made this place ""our spot"" prior to going to events downtown. The food was always great (still is actually), the jukebox lends as a good time, and the service had always been fun and upbeat. Unfortunately lately we have had several instances of poor service and we understand that can happen because everyone is allowed to have an off day now and again however we were on the receiving end of flat out rude servers and they were borderline mean. Not only were they mean to our table of 6 but threatened to call the police on another patron because she was questioning why other people received food before they did when they had been waiting longer (valid question). 

Last night, Management had only scheduled one bartender to run the whole restaurant while there was a hockey game in town as well as a special event happening at the Tampa theater. The Knight Parade was also happening in Ybor but not sure of it affected downtown as much. We realized the server was there by herself so being that most of us have been in the service industry we tried to help her clean off 3 different tables as people were leaving. She asked for our drink orders and got us our drinks. When we informed her that we wanted to order food she told us that she was going to go get her pad of paper and a pen. After finishing our 3rd drink over an hour later, she still hadn't come back to take our order and we had asked her to come over to our table twice. She was also taking food orders of people that had walked in way after we had arrived. So we pointed out that we had wanted to order food and that we were waiting for her to come back with her pen and pad of paper. She responded with ""I can't tell if you're kidding"" in a very sarcastic tone. We explained that we weren't kidding and that we had been there for over an hour and still hadn't ordered food. She responded with ""I'm the only one here and people are coming up to the bar. We can continue to discuss this or I can take your order.""  So we ordered anyways because we wouldn't have been able to get a table and eat somewhere else at this point before our event. A second server came in at this point to relieve her and she must have informed him that we questioned the slow service. He then took on the same attitude with us that she had. He was also the one responsible for threatening to call the police on a patron that was also questioning the slow service. We eventually had our food DROPPED OFF at our table by said gentleman. He didn't even let us know what the food was. We had to figure all the orders for ourselves. We had a plate of wings THROWN on our table last night by the female server and when we thanked her, she said ""YEP!"" 

Customers are not responsible for poor scheduling by management. Also, the staff needs to understand the words ""I'm sorry"" can go a long way. We as customers were trying to help her in the beginning and would have continued until we started receiving the attitudes when we did nothing to cause it. Nor did the other patron who was threatened to have the police called on her. She did nothing to deserve that except for ask a question. We will never again go to ""ANGRY BAR"". That's what we now call it.",2020-02-09 18:55:39

My wife and I first visited this pizza heaven last winter without much prior knowledge, other than Yelp reviews.  We've now been between 10-15 times, have eaten 13 of the 18 pizzas on the menu, and have tried every single special they've offered during the last 7 months.  There has not been a single pizza that we have not enjoyed, regular menu or special.

Here's a list of the pizzas I've really liked a lot, most of which are pictured on Yelp by me or someone else with their ingredients.
Margherita (had 2x), Picante, BLG, Autumn, Roma, and Dennis.  A lot of great pizzas on this list, but they're some of the more simple ones they make.

Now, here's a list of pizzas I've LOVED.
Green (insanely rich and creamy), Meat (their veal meatballs are awesome), Bianco (one of the oddest pizzas I've had, but the pistachios, ricotta, and rosemary oil work great together), Chicken (I've never seen so much bbq chicken on a pizza before), Tinga (incredible flavor to their chicken on this), Fernando (this is the ultimate mexican pizza, we've had it 3x now!), and the Shrimp Scampi (my personal favorite because of how buttery and lemony the pizza is...we've had this 3-4 times now!).

We've also really enjoyed the infamous Corn Pizza and had that one twice.  The Clam Pizza on Fridays during Lent was perfect. And the shockingly delicious ""Diet Pizza"" that had mac & cheese, hot dogs, and crumbled potato chips was another favorite.

Some other parts of the menu we've enjoyed would be the Meatball Parm Sandwich (can't reiterate this enough, the meatballs are good!), the pickles, and the Antipasto which was enormous and probably shouldn't have been consumed by just two people with their own pizza on the way.

Finally, some final things you should know.  This is a BYOB (yippee!!), but it is also very tiny :-(.  If you are planning on dining here, especially on a Friday or Saturday, you better go to their website and make a reservation (go here: http://www.olcepizza.com/events.html ).  I don't think there's another way to make a reservation and I've read too many horror stories on here about people being upset they got turned away from sit-down service at Olce.  Even if tables are unoccupied by a body when you arrive they may still be occupied by a reservation that is coming in and Olce doesn't mess around with not honoring reservations.  Don't make that mistake and post a bad review because you weren't prepared.

Olce Pizza Grille is amazing.  It's a diamond in the pizza-rough that is 90% of the PA pizza business.  They put love, creativity, and top notch ingredients into every pizza they make.  I'm so happy we've found it and that we live only a few miles away.  Thanks Olce!",2015-07-24 14:51:12

It's a smallish cafe that gave me Black Bear Bakery vibes when I walked inside. It seems kind of ""hip"" for no apparent reason. It's nestled on the corner of Taylor and Arco over by the Grove. 

I heard from many a Yelp review that this place had stellar Wild Blueberry Pancakes so that's what I ordered. I also got a mimosa which was probably a mistake because it wasn't super delicious or anything and it ended up making our bill be like $25something for just breakfast. I need to learn to stay away from the booze, bwhaha. Sean got the plain pancakes. He was disappointed that there was no French Toast at this place. Oddly enough they had Eggs Benedict as a special that day and I had been SEVERELY CRAVING them just one day prior but ended up getting my fix (sort of) at First Watch. So I was kinda bummed because otherwise I would have ordered the benedict in a heartbeat especially because the guy working the counter said they bring in a special chef to make them including homemade Hollandaise sauce...none of that powdered mix stuff! :)

Anyhoo. We opted to sit outside because it was a freak 70 degree day in November. Yeah WTF St. Louis?! Oh well I'm not complaining, lol. We were greeted by a cute little fuzzy bee. He wanted to eat everyone's syrup and that pissed some people off and they ended up relocating indoors. But we just kind of sat there and the bee landed on Sean's plate and chilled out while eating syrup off his knife all upside-down like. It was actually quite comical. We had a good laugh at the bee getting drunk off of La Dolce's tasty syrup. I am pretty sure it wasn't ""real"" maple syrup but it was still yummy, if memory serves me...

I'd definitely come back here. It wasn't overly packed like certain other brunch/breakfast spots *cough* Half and Half *COUGH* .... and the food was pretty good. Seemed a little expensive to me, though, but could have been due to my hankering for pre-noon alcoholism. Hrrrm. Next time I want to try something else with BERRIES in it hehehe. The ingredients here are verrry fresh!! Recommended place if you're looking for a new brunch spot to try and you don't want to fight crowds of yuppies/hipsters in Clayton. :D",2011-11-21 01:22:01

Reno is not ready for fine dining.  In fact, most people in Reno don't even know what fine dining really is.  Lulou's is banking on this fact and using an outrageously overpriced menu to brainwash the population into thinking that price equals quality. 

My husband and I visited Lulou's last Friday - on the 20th with reservations for 6:30.  We arrived about 15 minutes early with the thought of getting a drink at the bar while we wait for our table.  We were not given that option and were rushed to sit down as soon as we gave them our name. 

I really don't like to attack people but I have to say that Lulou's needs to employee a higher class of people.  Our waitress was not put together well and very rude.  We ordered a glass of wine each and she snapped at the wine menu to retrieve it.  We told her we would like to continue looking it over - she reluctantly let us keep it however each time she walked by our table she asked if we were done with it yet.  We finally just gave up and let her have the thing.

We ordered the baked lobster with escargot butter which was the highlight of the meal and amazing.  Every bite was extremely flavorful.  Unfortunately that appetizer was not enough to pull this review away from even one star.

My scallops were over cooked.  Nearly dark brown on the top and not at all juicy.  I received four of them surrounded by some squash.  It's easy to mess up scallops but any real fine dining place knows how to do them right.  Horribly disappointing.  

Now for the kicker.  My husband ordered a Rib Eye.  They gave him a Sirloin.  Anyone who knows meat knows that Rib Eye is fatty and full of marble in the middle.  There was zero fat and zero marble in the cut of meat they served him.  It was also over cooked.  It is our impression that LuLous is advertising a Rib Eye and then cutting costs and trying to pass of a cheaper piece of meat to increase their profit margin.

Our waitress did not smile once.  The manager who was walking around did not make eye contact or say hello once. The dining area is lit with natural day light rather than dimmed lighting.  You feel as if you are eating overpriced food in a coffee shop rather than a fine dining establishment.

$230.00 later.  I never knew disappointment could cost so much.",2018-07-25 19:49:21

She has absolutely been a catalyst for intense awareness and growth for me, and her powerful influence and wisdom never falters.

I've met with her after our initial meeting for healing/reading combos and for some events from her website and every time, I walk out beyond amazed and empowered. When I set an intention coming into my meetings with her, within the first five or so minutes, the intention is utterly fulfilled. What's more astounding, is that a lot of her predictions have come to be (already!) and all have occurred exactly or relatively similar to how she has described (in terms of time frame and description). 

The most important thing, for me, is that everything she says ALWAYS, always, always resonates with me. What she says is what I know intuitively but block with my own doubt and addled thinking. She is such a clear vessel, and I appreciate that I can always count on her conveying the utmost truth. She certainly puts a lot of things into perspective for me, and her space is completely free of judgement, condemnation, and preaching. 

I highly recommend recording sessions with her! I once made the choice not to record a shorter reading and boy, do I regret that! I keep trying to come back to her words at that time, and the slivers that I remember do serve me greatly, but I just wish I had recorded the whole thing. Grrr! Lesson learned though.

I can genuinely seek her guidance without feeling direly attached, and that's important to me. I feel strong enough to rely on my own intuition and strength, but my sessions with her are always incredibly uplifting and fulfilling and the perfect ""cherry on top"" for my journey. Meeting her has been utterly poignant in my process of becoming and the fact that she does not create a circumstance in which one feels dependent on her is truly remarkable (if you know anything about the metaphysical workers out there, you know that many of them use tactics of manipulation and fear to make their clients feel powerless and therefore like they NEED their work to make it through). 

There are true professionals and genuine seers, and I am so glad to have found one relatively close to me. She embodies the definition of a healer, intuit, mentor, and is one of the absolute best, at that.",2019-05-25 19:18:36

So far nothing really seems to have changed, including the menu, decor and Daisy Duke clad girls. Our girl seemed friendly enough and allowed me to try a sample of a beer I'd never had. Yay! She was quick to greet us and soon brought our cold beers, water with lemon wedges and implements for our appetizer.

Appetizer tonight was/is zucchini curls. That reminds me of the mezes (small plates/apps) one can find in a good taverna in Greece. Lightly fried pieces of fresh zucchini nice and hot but not mushy by any means. Only thing is that the panko Parmesan breadcrumbs they use go toward the salty due to Parmesan content. Sriracha ranch is a good foil for them (not as good as real tzatziki though). What a huge portion too! Box, please!!

So for dinner the Queen Bee opted for a simple house cheeseburger with fries and I opted for prosciutto wrapped meatloaf with a side of mashed taters. I was torn between that and the bison burger...I love a good bison burger but recall the meatloaf as having been one of the few I'd eat out. 

That being said: it was good, to be sure. Seems like they used to give a bigger portion in times gone by! Nice bite from Italian sausage in the mix. Prosciutto is a nice upgrade from bacon on this puppy. Gravy with mushrooms was good and spuds weren't out of a box or can, either. Could've done without the crappy onion straws atop the plate, however! Totally do not work!!

Queen Bee thought her burger was just okay. Not bad; not great. Just okay...I agree. That's probably why I kept telling her to get something else, but no. She left half of her little beef puck along with most of her so-so frozen fries and that was that. Girlie and check came without further ado and I must say she didn't ask why my other half left over half her food. Not a blasted word. Also, manager comes and introduces himself and asked how the food was. Okay; no better, no worse. Knucklehead just walks away without an apparent concern. Thanks, Demetrius....

I have no idea what makes Landry's so blasted successful since every time I've dined at one of their concepts I usually get disappointed. Tonight is no exception. They can keep this place. I don't see us coming back here in a good long while if at all. Get lost, Landry's.",2018-06-29 21:16:12

I was hesitant;  I had been to Luke's once before and while I didn't not remember thinking it was terrible, I remembered being extremely underwhelmed, especially for the price. It had been a while since I ate there so I figured, why not give it another try?   I asked the cashier (who was EXTREMELY patient and polite) for his recommendation, he suggested the crab.  I ordered a crab roll combo.  Much to my dismay, when I got the crab roll it was ridiculously salty.  I asked the team to remake the roll, explaining that it was salty.   The kind young man making the rolls happily obliged.  The second roll came and it was equally as salty.  I resigned that I would just eat the bread and leave it alone.  As I was complaining about the roll to my boss, the manager, Sam Andino, interjected, asking how the roll tasted.  I tried to brush it off, but she mentioned that she heard me complaining and asked what the problem was.  I explained that the roll was extremely salty.  She gave some suggestions including ""adding more butter to cut the salt""  and ""mixing the crab"".  She offered to make it right and then walked away.  Soon after she walked away, I tasted my boss' lobster roll, which tasted far better.  My boss spoke to Sam and requested a lobster roll in lieu of a crab roll.  After asking whether I preferred a half or a full (I selected a half), Sam walked away and said ""no problem.""  Sam returned with my half lobster roll and then mentioned getting me a bill for the new roll.  Confused, I said to my boss, ""I'm not paying for this.""  Sam returns only to tell me that I would be paying for this because the fact that I didn't like the roll was ""personal,"" so the most she could offer me, despite the fact the roll was so salty it was inedible, was a discount on the half a roll.  Stunned, I didn't even have it in me to argue with her about it.   I was shocked by Sam's apathy and the terrible customer service. I dine out frequently and I have NEVER been in a situation where a manager responds to a customer's discontent in this manner.  Needless to say, I will NEVER dine at Luke's again because I refuse to patronize establishments with terrible customer service.

Here's what it isn't: it isn't a chain restaurant a la Outback or Chili's, it isn't a fancy steakhouse like Fleming's or Ruth's Chris, and it isn't a posh bistro restaurant like those you will find flanking 21st Avenue and West End.

Here's what it is: a flashback to a bygone era when steakhouse meant huge portions, a good steak, and good solid side items, salads, and appetizers. It has good quality, a neighborhood feel, and a cozy atmosphere.

I was excited when I walked into Woody's and saw the old-fashioned oak furniture, the heavy stained-glass '70s era bar, and the color decor of woodsy, out of vogue hunter greens and deep burgundies. I knew I was in for the kind of meal not readily served anymore. I was also there with my father, who, if you take him to any classy restaurant, routinely complains that there's more decorations on his plate than food, and I knew Woody's would make him happy. 

I'm a little burnt out on fancy, yuppy, trendy. After a while, it gets old. Sometimes you just want a good ole' steak dinner. 

The menu is simple and probably hasn't changed in as many years as the decor hasn't changed. It comprises a list of staples, of which we sampled quite a few.

The onion rings are fantastic. I'm of the opinion that onion rings can't have too much breading - it just ain't possible. After all, I'm not eating them as part of a conscientious, healthy diet, now am I? The crabs-stuffed mushrooms were equally decadent. 

The salad was a traditional steakhouse salad. You won't see any goat cheese or walnuts or lavender vineagrette here. How refreshing!

I ate the seafood sampler, which came with crab cakes, grilled shrimp, AND blackened grouper, accompanied by the most enormous twice-baked potato I've ever witnessed (I took that home and ate it for lunch the next day). The other people at the table had a sampling of the steaks and the prime rib. I thought the rib eye was delicious, perfectly cooked, and tender, and although I'm not usually a fan of prime rib (too much blobby fat), these looked more like a good cut of meat than what I'm accustomed to seeing at chain restaurants. 

At Woody's, you won't get that fancy new-fangled 1990's spawned chain steakhouse fare; however, you will get a lot of food and you will get classic, tasty, traditional steakhouse food.

We came in on a busy Friday night. There was a mix of families and date nights in abundance.  The place was bustling as it is December and lots of people out for holiday events, etc...  

I called ahead to see if there was a wait.  Great customer service on the phone first off which was a nice first impression.  She said it was a 15 min wait but was happy to put my name down. 

When we arrived, we were down to less than 5 minutes. We were seating in a nice part of the restaurant and had an excellent waiter appointed to us. 

He made some suggestions and we ended up changing our minds like 3 times because everything sounded good. 

We decided after seeing a ton of pizzas around the room to try theirs.  This was not my intention. 

We started with a martini for the mister which was strong, stuffed plump olives and a heck of a lot of gin.  I ordered a house chianti which I was so worried because it was only $4 a glass.   Totally a great table wine. I am glad I listened to him as he saved me a ton of money. 

We then ordered salads which were crisp, fresh and really yummy and out came a basket of butter drenched garlic bread.  I am not complaining but oh holy arteries - yum!

We decided on a pizza with eggplant, spinach & meatball slices. 

It was piping hot, crisp and thin which I like.  Not a soggy bite anywhere.  I think this may be my new favorite pizza in town.  

It was really really good.  Enough that almost 4 days later, I am craving it!

I will definitely go back.  I also noticed they had a back area and had a big private party going on.  The place gave us really great service even with all that going on. 

We had a movie to catch so we asked to box up our pizza.  I told him I had a refridge bag in my trunk.  The waiter was kind enough to come out with a triple lined bag full of ice to keep our pizza fresh.  The weather was chilly that night so I wasn't too worried but it was wonderful of him to do so. 

The old negative reviews were when they first opened.  I think maybe they worked out their kinks because we had a fantastic experience.  I will come back for traditional items and report back.",2012-12-18 06:17:44

First of all, we walked in and the place smelled like a sewer. But since my friend, who lives in New Orleans, had recommended it to me, I decided to attribute the smell to our proximity to the water and the age of the building. Unfortunately, it actually smelled bad because the seafood we were served was rotten, as was the sauce. We got the famous ocean sauce, and it was disgusting. Really. Rotten seafood, and the sauce smelled like rotten cheese, and the veal chop below it was mushy and lukewarm, as was half the sauce. Prior to that, for the appetizer, we split a cannelloni, which was not a cannelloni in the first place, and then it was served with lukewarm spinach that clearly came directly out of a store bought freezer package and had not even made it to hot yet, nevermind being seasoned at all. The sausage in the 'cannelloni' was good, and the sauce was okay. 
The house wine is terrible, and the pasta is what you buy at the store for 99 cents. 
I'd be perfectly willing to go to a restaurant that uses frozen spinach, pre-packaged salad, and cheap pasta, if they were charging me $8 for a family sized portion and calling themselves a 'family restaurant'. However, the fact that I had to pay $25 for a rotten entree instead, with all the above cheap, rotten, and lukewarm ingredients, is unforgivable and just plain offensive. 
We sent our veal with ocean sauce back and that was comp'ed, yet nothing else was offered, even though when the chefs themselves got it back and tried it they said, ""Oh, that really is terrible."" Our waitress reported that back to us. But we still had to pay for the other lukewarm dishes and our warm, cheap wine, and we had to pay for the experience of being in a nasty smelly place, which, I agree with you, should have turned us away from the very beginning, if only I hadn't thought I should trust my recommender. 
This is a place that only survives because it is located in a position where there are enough tourists who don't know or care what they're eating and who will go there because it is in a convenient location. Even had the sauce not been rotten that night, the rest of the ingredients and attention to food quality would have been the same.
Ruined the start of our night. We went and did shots afterwards to put something antiseptic in our stomachs to make sure that the two pieces of crawfish and shrimp and the tiny teaspoonfuls of rotten sauce that we had tried would not poison us. Oh, and to restart our night and enjoy the great music on Frenchmen St.",2015-08-01 06:21:25

After leaving Sierra Gold on Christmas Eve with a sack full of seafood for our feast of the five fishes, I was so impressed with the place I wrote this whole review... in my head... and forgot to post it!

If you want to enjoy restaurant quality seafood at home, allow me to introduce you to Sierra Gold Seafood. That's right. This is where most of our area's top restaurants buy the seafood you enjoy when dining out. Started as a wholesale only operation, the family decided to open their doors to the public within the last year, and residents have been slowly discovering the advantages of shopping at this family run fish market. 

As a South Floridian transplant, the incredible selection of seafood available is what I miss most. As a fisherman, I loved seeing the fresh catch and knowing where it came from and how, if I so chose, to go get it myself. The seasonality of the catch made visiting fish markets there fun, and it was always fun perusing the array of products available from the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. And thanks to three international airports in close proximity and world class restaurants, you could also find excellent examples of seafood from the Pacific and beyond. Living in Reno, the available seafood is pretty much limited to what's commercially fished right along the Pacific coast, and it's rare now to see much from the Atlantic and Gulf that's affordable... until I discovered Sierra Gold.

Sierra Gold Seafood is a little taste of home for me. Just walking through the doors, taking in the smell of what can only be a seafood market, and reading the fresh catch on the chalkboard takes me back to my days in FL. The refrigerated cases are filled with the freshest seafood of all shapes and sizes, from all over, and at price points we all can enjoy. When I visited the case had a beautiful side of swordfish, blood red ahi tuna (sushi grade), U-10 shrimp (them the big ones!), oysters, clams, and much more! And if you're having a party or just want to enjoy something a little more obscure, just ask! They're one of the only special order seafood markets I know of in our area, and they can get their hands on just about anything. 

As our foodie culture evolves, and restaurants and residents want more specialty products, Sierra Gold Seafood will prove to be an even more incredible asset than it already is today. We already know having a great relationship with your butcher or cheese purveyor pays itself forward, and people are already slowly discovering this place, so get in now and start a relationship with our local fish monger to you can get the best bites in the future!",2015-01-03 01:11:51
7TPBQ-U2-qSh9rRAOBG0IQ,df3kNNGt5nykGt4Q6MH1ew,aUjJ_x1KuvWmqIErhdaHzg,3.0,4,4,3,"Possibly a 3.5- Finally, a Thai place in the Indy area with some decent PANANG!

The wife and I had been craving Thai, and were determined to find a decent spot in Indy.  Not wanting to travel too far outside of the Fishers area, we elected to go to Thai Smile 2.

AMBIENCE- this place isn't too big.  I'm guessing a max of 30 people (and that'd be really tight) could fit in this place.   There are about 3 booths, and a wall of seats on the right hand side.  For as ""cozy"" as the place was, it seemed like a pretty nice spot.  Typical Thai restaurant decoration adorn the walls, and the only real draw back I saw, is that on a cold day, every time the door opens, people sitting near the entrance (yeah, that was us) get cold cocked by the wind.

SERVICE- Seeing as how the place isn't too big, there were only 3 servers- 2 of which appeared to be the owners of the place.  They managed to do a pretty good job, and were very polite.  I asked the one non-Asian server a question about the menu, to which she replied ""I've only worked here for a few weeks now.""  She was still very nice, and passed along the question to one of the owners.

MENU- this place is a Thai restaurant first and foremost.  Not like some of those other ""Thai"" joints that also have a number of Korean dishes, or Japanese dishes.  They had it all- your curries (panang, masaman, yellow, red), noodles (pad thai, pad see yew, drunken noodles), stir fries and other house recommendations.

FOOD- the wife and I order two dishes at every Thai restaurant we go to.  It is sort of our listhmus test to how good a place is.  We ordered the panang curry with chicken and the pad thai.  My wife also ordered a bowl of wonton soup.

The soup was good, with a mild sweet taste to it.  The panang curry had a great flavor to it, while the pad thai was a bit different.  It had a subtle sweetness to it as well, which my wife and I really aren't used to.  One thing that I found very interesting about dinner is the rice.  Or should I say, how it was served.  

Most places you go to give you your own rice, but not this place.  When your meal is brought out, they have a ""communal"" pot of rice they bring from table to table, and serve you as little or as much as you want.  If you need more, all you need do is ask.  I think this is actually a pretty smart thing to do on their part.  It probably saves on wasting rice, though if it were super busy, it could be kind of annoying.  It was sad they didn't pack any rice for us with our leftovers, but alright because we have our own rice cooker at home.

Overall- I would probably come back here, or at the very least, order some take out for the wife and I.  The prices were pretty decent, with most dishes being about 8.99-12.99.  The specials were a bit more, but then again, they are ""special.""  Still looking for a Thai place with good panang and pad thai.  The search continues.

Yesterday I put in an order through the Cheesecake Factory website, and I scheduled delivery for today between 12:30 and 1:00 at my office. This lunch was for a meeting, and our order was fairly large. I was worried about putting through such a large order through an online process (Door Dash), so I called the Cheesecake Factory to see if I could place the order online. The girl that I spoke with stated that she did not know how to do that and transferred me to the Bakery. After waiting on the phone for 15 minutes and no response, I decided to trust the online service and hung up. 

This morning I called again to see if the delivery order was processed through the online site. I spoke with a different girl, and she was just as clueless. She said that if the order had a time on it that we would receive it. I again stated that I would just like to confirm. She transferred me to the Bakery, and I sat on the phone for another 15-20 minutes with no response.

At around 12:30, I received a call from our Door Dash driver. He said that he showed up at The Cheesecake Factory, and they did not have our order ready. They stated that they had no record of our order. The Door Dash driver said that he was having them work on it so that he can deliver soon.

After speaking with the driver, I called The Cheesecake Factory again to see if I could speak with a Manager and see what happened with our order. I was transferred to the Manager, who continued to explain that they just did not have our order. No further explanation...no solution...Basically just a ""whoops, sorry!"" He also stated that they still didn't have our order made. When I asked what the Door Dash driver was talking about then, he said he was not sure because they just don't have our order. He told me that Door Dash is completely separate from The Cheesecake Factory???? I then questioned why it is on their website and asked who was getting the money for our order. He explained that Door Dash gets all money from every delivery order coming out of The Cheesecake Factory. 

I called the Door Dash driver back to see what he was delivering since the manager had no record of our order, and he said that the restaurant was extremely unorganized, and no one seemed to know anything. The driver ended up putting through the order in the Bakery, and apparently the Manager was not aware that he was back there doing that. 

At around 1:45, our delivery driver showed up with the order. You would think that the plus side would be that the order was hot and fresh since it was just made and is literally 5 minutes from my office. Unfortunately it was cold, and everything was poorly prepared and thrown in boxes carelessly. To top it all off, the meatballs were not cooked- see picture.",2018-12-14 20:50:24

Came here for a Saturday morning brunch with the boyfriend and another friend after debating for a while. We sat outside because it was a beautiful day, so I didn't actually get a chance to look around at how the inside of the restaurant is laid out. But I must say, the outside black and red paint job really screams traditional Irish Pub. They've got a great location right on Central, which means I'm sure it gets crazy in the night's and evenings on weekends, but it was great for brunch.

Service was middling. Our server was very pleasant but she seemed a little flighty sometimes.  The coffee flowed freely but everything else was a little bit slow for a bunch of breakfast items. My friend and I got biscuits and gravy and they initially forgot to give us the gravy. My friend had ordered an appetizer for himself, but when we split the bill they initially split that evenly for all of us. And they apparently charged my boyfriend incorrectly, resulting in three charges on his card, which he only found out later that day after looking at his statement. They assured us when we called that only the correct charge would actually process, but didn't warn us while we were actually at the restaurant.

The food was definitely good, though there were so quirks, and there was a TON of it. We started with the Rueben Egg Rolls which are decently sized and come with a side of Thousand Island Dressing. My friend and I ordered the corned beef hash special that came with a decent portion of hash, two eggs, two biscuits with sausage gravy, and a side choice of either potatoes or grits. I ordered cheese grits and got a huge portion, almost as large as my main plate, or creamy grits with a cheese crust. The food was incredibly good too, so I wanted to eat it all, but I held back. My boyfriend got the Guinness Burger and at the waitress's suggestion got brown gravy with his fries, and got a huge portion of everything too. In the end we all left with full stomachs AND full leftover boxes.

Because there was so much food, the prices were very reasonable. If I remember correctly I paid $17 for my entire meal and tip. But because everything seems to come in huge portions here there's nothing especially cheap. If you're just looking for a small, cheap, quick meal this may not be the place for you.

But, if you're looking for something to satisfy a monstrous hunger with some real Irish classics on the menu, this place is definitely for you.",2016-05-06 15:20:33

To start when we moved in the place was dirty human and dog hair everywhere and stains in the bathroom etc. when trying to reach out and get any help after move in it was almost impossible. I've had 15 maybe more emails ignored by the property manager. It was all great and perfect before move in and now after it's basically ""good luck"" 

Second for the first 6 months we moved in the neighbors above us were always loud, not just a party loud or anything like that. Just aggressively wake you up out of your sleep type loud which the office told me was ""normal apartment noise and they can't do anything"" ALSO  Cindy then decided to tell me that I'm too loud sometimes also when before hand and before raising this issue no one had told me or let me know... and then after following up 20-30 times maybe more about the neighbors majority of my emails were ignored over the 6 month period. When I finally got a reply the response and their solution was they were moving out in 30 days so deal with it. 

3rd neighbors move in below us almost right after those moved out. It's a couple who screams and argues with a baby who would just scream and cry while they argue to the point you could hear it inside outside first to third floor loud. The office again did nothing although cops showed up almost nightly till they got evicted 2 months after moving in. 

4th I went to pay my rent this month for September and the site wouldn't let me on.. I was told either bring a check down or it looks like the site should be back up (response was later in the day this time) By the time I got home from work which is late, the site still would not let me on. I communicated this to the office to still not get a reply for 2 or 3 days and then when I finally get a reply it stated that since I didn't pay it or bring a check by when I was told it was fixed that I had to pay the 100 dollar late fee... I wasn't not trying to pay rent on time YOUR SITE WASNT WORKING and now THE NOLEN is screwing me out of 100 dollars and if you ask for a corporate number or regional person number they won't respond to your emails or help you. 

This apartment does not care about its residents. Do not let the niceness before hand fool you, after you move in they do not care and won't help you if you have issues.",2020-10-09 14:12:40
Sw9mFBD59LkABSqnxQCcJQ,HmWN-MqOLdJKJshsKA4VpA,4R2KR_-FybS7oegGrXjHVg,3.0,0,0,0,"Honest review from 12/13/2018. 

We had a party of 8 at 8pm this past Friday. I was debating between 3 and 4 stars because we did have a great time but let me explain to see if this helps or not. 

We had a table right at the top of the stairs. Being that it is a Friday and the fact that it is Christmas time the place was jammed packed. We were right in the center of the action. Some people may like that some people may not but just a heads up. Some at our table were being bumped into which did not bother us at all but just giving you a heads up. 

Next to our table was a current NFL player (former Eagle) which I will not give his name because I believe in privacy, but the reason I bring this up is that it is amazing how the staff swoons over famous people. It was kind of cheesy in my opinion. I get it you have to play the game but not my cup of tea. 

On to the food. The food was very good. That is why I was debating between 3 and 4 stars( bc it was really yummy). We basically tried everything on the menu. From porter house to filet to stuff and turf all very very good. Sides were delicious as well. My favorite was the lobster Mack and cheese. Usually this dish always sounds great and does not live up to the hype but Thai was really good. But the 2 potato sides (au gratin and the truffle option) were great. I had the surf and turf with the king crab legs and it was tasty. I had it Oscar style as well and I was happy. 

One hiccup with the food. My gf found a piece of tin foil at the bottom of one of her pieces of filet trio. Since we were at a bday event I did not want to make a huge deal but I called over what appeared to be a manager and he was very nice, asked if we wanted another one (we declined) and said he would take it off the bill (which it was). Mistakes happen and we thought it was nice for the swift action. Little strange we never heard from our waiter about it but I appreciate the man who helped us just handling business. 

We also decided to get a mixture of cocktails and wine which the table loved. My gf got the Spicy Margarita and I got some rum drink and very good. 

Now the reason for the 3 stars. We all knew the prices are off the charts which is fine, but when you are spending over a 1000, I would expect that service would be over the top. Our waiter was very good with working the table explaining options, friendly, outgoing but we had to constantly ask for water, plates were left on the table to long etc( the little things). If you are going to charge what you charge then I expect the same level of service in return. Sorry to sound like the grinch just giving my honest opinion. I will say, the entire staff was hustling as it was packed and we did enjoy our waiter. 

I do want to give a shout out to the restroom attendant. He was the man. Friendly and he had everything you needed. I mean everything. I have come across many in the past but this guy was like Superman. 

I'm closing, I would return, we had good food and good drinks, place is really nice, great vibe but I think they just need a little attention to detail.",2018-12-15 13:09:56

We looked, and looked and looked everywhere we went.  And either what seemed to be ""local"" to Nevada was in fact made somewhere else, or it was all basically chocolate.
So, when I recently discovered Buy Nevada First, I was super excited to tell Cheryl I had found it, I had found the store we so desperately needed during her last visit!
We popped in on a Wednesday morning before our drive to Sacramento and we were NOT dissapointed!  
The first items we saw upon entering were an array of cute and unique handmade soaps. This was perfect as Cheryl buys one of her friends back home in Chicago soaps every Christmas and they last her all year. It's their ""thing"". I can't remember the name of the company that makes them at the moment,  but it was nice to see that they had more then just the usual fair of scents. I immediately saw a pretty brown and cream swirled bar with just a hint of blue and green glitter on the very top called ""Reindeer Poop""! I brought it over to Cheryl and she proceeded to squeal with delight! She picked up that one and another that was shaped like the state of Nevada and was scented with sage/sagebrush. 
There's a whole section for Kimmie Candy, handmade items including scarves, hats, gloves, etc. Candles, tshirts, books by local authors and books about Nevada. There's local beers, wine, sauces, jams, jellies, dressings, jerky, fudge, I got some of course. So much to choose from! 
The owner was very nice and helpful and I had a pleasant conversation with him. Turns out, he will be taking over part of the empty space where Burlington used to be and he will be seeing it up so that local vendors can have a spot to sell their items! I might just have to fire up my crochet hooks, knitting needles, and Woodburner to make a bunch of stuff and sell it! Yup, I am very crafty and creative!
This is not only a great store to find locally made items of all kinds, but it's also a great store to find that perfect gift for someone,  especially those that may be harder to shop for!
I'm planning on going back next week, this time with Mom to pick out some condiments we can try! I'm also very excited to see what will be available next door once that expansion is all set up and ready to go!
I love that we now have a local shop at which to purchase locally made items and support those artisans and businesses in our community and state!
I fell in love with Buy Nevada First and I know I will be shopping here for years to come and telling everyone to shop here as well! What a great store, great items,  and decent prices! 
Support Local and Happy Yelping!!",2016-12-20 01:03:04
dr3P_Xs9iWhclKuWGRtfhg,3QnoTcrxuafMCoTzW_AH7A,W6k6b-bUaX0goySzl-zgTg,4.0,19,12,22,"Yum! Been dying to try a poke' bowl and the taste did not disappoint! There's over a dozen pre designed bowls (including veggie) to choose from here, some with clever names of local neighborhoods. You can also grab a sheet at the front and completely create your own which is what I chose to do to keep it as healthy as possible. 

Since I'm vegan I decided to chose the organic tofu as my protein. It's served plain, not fried with no seasoning or breading in other words, perfect for those watching caloric intake. I must say I really appreciate tofu being offered as most poke' spots I've come across don't have a plan based protein. Other protein options include yellowtail, crabmeat (+$1), big eyed tuna, Scottish salmon, eel, shrimp and chicken, so definitely something for everyone. 

I went with seasonal mixed greens and nixed the rice in order to keep it light. On this initial visit I added cucumbers, red onion, edamame, carrot and pineapple from their list of over a dozen mix ins. 

I chose the spicy sesame shoyu which was the sauce option with the least amount of calories. After I asked the lovely girl behind the counter, she informed me it's mostly soy sauce based with a hint of sesame oil and a bit of Sriracha so no need to really worry about the oil too much. It was tasty and on the light side but still had nice flavor with just a hint of heat. 

I opted for the avocado which is $1 up-charge as a topping because well, avocado. Duh. The seaweed salad as a topping I felt was also a good choice to add some texture, wetness and flavor. 

For flare I chose the fried garlic bits. Holy yum! I highly recommend these! It added such a punch and crunch. Hey, I rhyme! 

The bowl I created was over $11, but I was just happy to keep it mostly healthful and fresh...and fast, which isn't always so simple to do. 

The only minor complaint I have would be my bowl wasn't as pretty as I would've liked. I say this not only because it wasn't as ""Insta worthy"" as I was anticipating, and how others seemed to be, but because a lot of the mix ins were at the bottom of the the bowl and the bowl was filled so much I couldn't properly blend. Not a huge deal. Next time I'll just ask for them to be placed side by side instead. 

This area definitely needed a ""fast food"" option beside Lorenzo's and Wawa and I'm happy it's a healthy one for a change!! Can't wait to return and keep creating my own unique combinations! I think the kiddos will enjoy it also because kids love anything 'make your own'.

However, prior to our arrival the people from hotels.com had contacted my friend and notified him that due to the heavy rain, the Best Western had been flooded and that we had been moved to the New Orleans Marriott. Sweet!!

We arrived here on a Friday night. The lobby was super packed and the line to check in was pretty long. We waited a little bit before it was our turn. We had requested for rooms with two double beds plus a roll away bed in each room to accommodate all six of us. However, they didn't have anymore availability for doubles rooms and as such we were upgraded to a larger corner room with a King bed and we were also provided with a $50 bar credit and a $120 breakfast buffet credit for six at the 5 Fifty 5 bar at the lobby. SUPER SWEET!!

The elevators in the hotel is pretty sweet, too. You don't have tons of buttons inside the elevator, but instead, when you're calling for an elevator you press the floor you want to go to and it will tell you which elevator you should wait at. For example, I was staying on the 37th floor, so when I'm calling for an elevator, I'd press 37 and the display will then show something like, ""E"" and and arrow pointing me where to go. This tells me that I should wait by the E elevator. Schweet, right? This way, there's no way some drunk asshole or some bratty kid get on the elevator with you will press all the buttons for the floors between the lobby and 37. 

When we got to our rooms, the beds were comfortable; the bathrooms were clean, and even the roll away beds were comfortable. There's plenty of extra pillows in the closet and plenty of towels. The only downside is the door seems to be pretty thin, as you walk down the hallway, you can definitely hear the noises from inside the room.

The amenities that the hotel provides is meh. Internet is $12.95 per day. Come on! I mean, I bitch about having to pay $40 internet PER MONTH! And I'm forced to pay a third that for a day. Ridiculous.
Parking is $38 per day. Yes, THIRTY EIGHT FREAKING DOLLARS! Is real estate really that expensive here? Or does Marriott just love milking their guests? I'm going to go with the latter.

So, if you drive here and need WiFi, that's already an additional $50/day on top of what you're paying for the room. And let's not forget the tax, alright? They add up quick. Boo for these and hence I'm taking away one star.

Other than my disappointment in the high charge for internet and parking, my stay was otherwise enjoyable.  If you're considering to stay here, remember to factor in internet and parking to your budget.",2015-04-18 20:45:17

I gave the rude attendant my driver's license and then signed the documents in front of him. He rejected my request to notarized since my signature on the documents didn't ""exactly "" match my driver's license. The driver's license signature is shrunk and distorted!  My picture was on the license.  I also had additional picture identification which he rejected. My experience was compounded by the fact that these documents are time sensitive.  He was unwilling to review additional documents with my official signature. I would suggest if you need anything notarized DO NOT GO HERE!


In response to your response to my Yelp comments. If you look at the video tape then when we entered your store the sale clerk asked what we were here for, we politely said to have some documents notarized. She jumped at us and said you have to have an appointment! All we did was respond and said we have an appointment. At 4 o'clock. And she said oh I'm sorry then she stepped over to tell you that we were here.  Y'all chatted for a while you continue to put some type of bubble wrap in a box, tape it, and generally ignore us while doing menial work wasting our time. Instead of stopping putting bubble wrap into a box and returning to that task after you had taken care of a waiting customer, you continued - as we waited patiently even though we could clearly see that what you were doing was not urgent. You decided to be rude. So let's get the video tape and compare notes sir. You were rude! You had me sign my documents, all three of them, not just one and then you told me the signatures do not match! The documents that I was signing with my left hand were affidavits to an injury to my left hand!  Of course I would not be able to sign exactly since my left hand has been damaged! And as I reiterated, the signature on my drivers license is distorted and shrunk considerably. Also, if you look at the video tape you will notice that you flippantly tossed my license back at me and said you would not notarize these when we ask why you said the signature did not match. We offered additional verification with photo and signatures but you refuse to look at them, you walked away behind your pillar, instead of engaging us and explaining why you would not except additional photo/signature IDs. So let's not go to your video unless you want a full viewing of how rude you and your staff are!  So your statement about being hauled into court are unfounded, since I was the person mentioned in the affidavits, that was me in your store, and that was my signature!  So why would you be hauled into court for notarizing a false signature?  You're actions are a reflection of the company you represent. And I notice your rating continues to fall. I wonder what it is going to take before UPS decides to investigate the problems you are having with basic customer service issues.",2017-04-06 21:16:14

I showed the girl a picture of what I wanted and also showed her where I wanted it to fall on my shoulder since I was having several inches cut off. She proceeded to ask me if I still wanted to be able to wear my hair up and I told her that I did- which would have been no problem if she had cut it to where I showed her I wanted it. So she started cutting my hair and all seemed to be just fine. After she started drying it she turned my chair away from the mirror. At the time I didn't think much of it. She proceeded to heavily curl my hair and I chalked it up to the picture I had showed her the girl some curl in her hair. From the front when I looked at my hair before I left the salon it seemed a bit shorter than what I had asked for, but like I said she had curled it so i figured once it was straight, it would be a little longer. I left the salon feeling pretty good about my cut. Once I got home I realized that not only was it much shorter than what I had wanted but she had also given me a bob hair cut which I did NOT ask for. Not only that, but she also seems to have tried to ""stack"" my hair in the back and did such a horrible job that it looks completely ridiculous. It honestly looks like a child cut a layer of my hair off in the back. And to top it off... its so  short especially in the back that I am not able to wear it up to hide how awful of a job she did. Thankfully I found someone else who can try fix it this week by softening some of the layers and even it out a little but unfortunately because its so short theres is little that can be done until it grows back out. This was by far the worst hair cut I have ever had. I have never had someone mess my hair up like this. There is no way she didn't know how bad of a job she had done. I wish she would have admitted she messed it up and tried to fix it, or at least could have asked another stylist to try to fix it while I was still in the salon. Very disappointed that I spent over $50 including tip for such a bad hair cut. Needless to say, I won't be back.",2020-02-18 01:32:41

We had reservations for 7:00 and arrived at 6:55, seated instantly which is always nice.  I was surprised that we were seated downstairs at a table big enough for four since they seemed busy.  I'm used to them sitting us on the second floor at tables for two.  In hindsight, I wish I had requested the 2nd floor.  The first floor is very noisy and there is lots of traffic.  

Our waiter was by within a minute to tell us the specials and offer us the wine list.  He was very friendly, but it was difficult to hear him even though he was speaking up.  The restaurant is just noisy by design.  As we were celebrating, I decided to take the wine list and we chose a bottle of the Chateau Ste Michelle, which was not too expensive ($8.50/$34) as far as restaurant wine bottles go.  We started with fried mozzarella, which, along with the bread, was quite good.  

For the main course I had the Rustic Chicken & Shrimp, and my wife had the Chicken Piccata w/broccolini and pasta.  I enjoyed my dish and felt it was a good portion size  - not too large, but definitely large enough to eat half, be satisfied, and take the other half home if you don't want to stuff yourself.  It had a little bit of everything, and had a nice amount of cheese melted/baked on top.  It had more meat than I was expecting for that kind of dish.

I tried some of my wife's broccolini and thought it was very good, probably great for someone who enjoys the top of broccoli but not the stem.

Then we had dessert...my wife had the profiteroles, I had the cheesecake, and we both had espresso with mini biscotti.  The profiteroles are a good size...the cheesecake was absolutely massive, with 4-5 strawberries on the side.  I tried my best but could not finish it, although it was very good.  I would have preferred a slightly stiffer crust, but this was a small detail.  We also got an order of Vera's lemon cookies to go.

Overall I was happy we went there.  I still feel stuffed the next morning, but very satisfied.  It was a bit more than we typically spend on a night out to dinner ($130 including tip) but considering we had appetizers, 2-3 glasses of wine, sides, coffee, and three desserts, I'd say we got a good value.",2010-09-12 14:36:59

With the average of 3.5 yelp stars I was super weary of visiting  and have fought my husband and won with visiting other restaurants in the city. Well, we finally went... I mean, you cannot beat the Coolinary menu which includes three courses for $39, https://www.arnaudsrestaurant.com/menus/arnauds-restaurant-coolinary-menu/, and FREE corkage for the months of July and August! I mean, come on! Free corkage!! Oh, lets not forget that you can also pair your dinner with two wines for $18... So, off we went carrying our own bottle and ready to fight to get the Free corkage and coolinary menu. Guess what, no fight. The coolinary menu was presented right after the main menu, and we were treated like royalty when it came to the wine service. I am a sucker for trying cocktails at each restaurant we visit, so I partook in the French 75 which had Courvoisier VS, Sugar, Lemon Juice, Moet and Chandon Champagne. Boy it was amazing... a little pricey at $13.75, but delicious. My daughter had a Shirley Temple, which I am generally against her having anything like it, but it was a special treat for her and was only $1.75. The three adults each indulged in the coolinary menu, while my daughter ordered the crab cakes. Each of us had a different appetizer. I would say the shaved asparagus was the best, as it was refreshing and not too filling. Two adults had the red fish, which they said was quite good, and I had the flank steak which was tender and delicious. The dessert course was to die for. My husband had the panna cotta with strawberries, it was light and creamy... a nice ending to a heavier meal. I had the s'mores trifle. I was weary since I don't love s'mores, but man this thing was to die for.. it was super rich with layered ganache, caramel and a really great marshmallow like substance. If you go during coolinary, get this dessert! Enough about the food! The service was excellent. We went quite early and were some of the only people in the restaurant. At first, I thought they might be super overwhelming with taking care of us, but once we were settled with bread and drinks we were left alone in a good way. The ambiance of the place is alone worth the visit. The glass work on the windows is beautiful, the floors are cool... it is like stepping back in time. Be sure to wear a collared shirt to fit in with the dress code....unless you are a rebel.. we did see someone in a tee-shirt and shorts, and I don't even think they gave him a hard time (my hubby was a little jealous of the guy). Overall, I say check this place out asap! Seriously, if you are here in August for coolinary take advantage! If not, I would still say go! It is definitely worth it.",2016-08-18 15:33:47
tTCfdXMt00kj1lDKLdo90Q,BtdqTErMCjvrQxKmBlJ7Uw,bjPUhanWoinHi2kywvVzBA,5.0,1,0,0,"Can't believe I have never written a review for Mercato! I have been here only with my husband. We came here for a date night in the summer or so about 3 years ago and ended up moving to the block in 2019! We have only been here a few times since moving in so close by. It's a challenge not to let the smells bring us in.

We mostly just do takeout these days. We did eat at Mercato in July 2020 because we eloped and wanted to go out afterward. Being that we breathe the same air as the restaurant guests on a normal day anyway, we figured it was safe to eat outdoors there. We brought our own champagne. We have done takeout at least 2 times since, last night being the most recent.

I saw on Instagram (not by walking by, ironically) that they were now offering rustic sandwiches! I love me a good sandwich and the chicken cutlet caesar was speaking to me. Husband got his first vaccine dose yesterday so we decided to celebrate with takeout (Mercato is a part of all of our major pandemic life milestones I guess haha) and I got the sandwich! It was delicious. The roll was perfectly soft and crusty all at the same time. The chicken was crispy but it definitely was a cutlet vibe, not a fried chicken sandwich vibe - just what you expect from an Italian joint. Husband got his favorite: the chicken parm. It's an old favorite and Mercato's version of it never disappoints. 

We usually get the stuffed meatball appetizer but we remembered how good the ricotta toast was in the summer (I think it was a citrus version with oranges or tangerines maybe) so we ordered the fig ricotta toast as our appetizer. That ricotta toast is so amazing and really stole the show. I hope since they have had a version of it on the menu for a while that it's going to stick around and the flavor will change seasonally. It's so light and delicious.

Mercato never disappoints! Definitely would recommend.

COVID-19 PRECAUTIONS: We still aren't ready to dine out until we are both fully vaccinated and are only doing takeout but if you want to come here, the staff is wearing masks. Indoor capacity seems a little tight now that Philly increased capacity limits... There are dividers between tables but I dunno. That's a lot of people still breathing the same air since air goes anywhere it wants... Outdoors, each table has its own ""bubble"" so if you're already around the folks in your party often anyway, you'll pretty much just be breathing the same air as them and it seems a safer option. The bubble protects you from the elements and you don't come into contact with other maskless patrons (or nearby residents who might be walking through, haha) unless they somehow enter your bubble. If you do takeout and want to eat outdoors nearby but not at the restaurant, there is a little park very close by at the corner of 11th and Pine that you could try to grab a table at. I don't think they gave us any cutlery with our order so you may have to ask or BYO if you're going picnic style.",2021-03-06 21:54:19
l-mQyCtZmNrCOYQedP0Xsg,TzUbr6BiQwR1bNfVOuE4GQ,mXqPZavl8dVBgk8nIwTiPg,4.0,7,0,1,"Today is Friday after all... It's been a long week, and my husband and I were in the mood for a wine tasting! We went to Wine Depot for the first time, as we had seen the wine tasting events that were posted at www.localwineevents.com and also on yelp. Additionally, we had a living social certificate, that Wine Depot offered this week ($15 for $30 of wine). 

Let me preface this review by saying that if you're expecting a fancy location, think again. As it says in other reviews- the location is one of the most unattractive and unassuming wine shops I've ever been to. (It's next to Pottery Blow Out on Grant, just west of Alvernon, which- in my opinion is one of the most difficult intersections to navigate in the whole city)!  Alas, if you can get safely off Grant Road, and get in the door- that's where you leave Tucson and all its glorious potholes behind, and you enter German wine country- thanks to Frank Lietzau, the shop's owner, who is from Germany. 

I read the other reviews, and maybe at one time they did have wines from other regions, but currently they only carry German wines. My experience with German wines hasn't been the greatest, so when I heard that statement upon our entrance, I breathed an automatic sigh of disappointment. Well.... I was WRONG! These wines are phenomenal, and well worth the prices. 

This evening, Frank was sampling four whites and one red. We tried all four of the whites. The first one was, as Frank put it- a ""Riesling hybrid,"" which was my least favorite. It was a dry wine, but flat. The second one was a dry sauvignon blanc, which was tart, crisp, and wonderful. The third was a dry riesling, which was an amazing value for $20 per bottle. The fourth was another riesling- this one sweet, that I didn't much care for. He saved the piece de resistance for last- a single vineyard Pinot Noir that was out of this world! It was $52 per bottle, but better than any Oregon Pinot I've tried. 

The deal with this place is that they're only open on Saturday from 11-6. Apparently this 4-6 PM Friday wine tasting must be a new thing. (?) I ended up buying two bottles. A Pinot from the same winery as the single vineyard: Weingut Bercher-Burkheim at $31 per bottle, and a full bodied Cuvee Cabernet blend: Eberbach-Schafer for $39 per bottle. I only know the names of the vineyards from the labels, otherwise- since they are in German, I'd never be able to remember them. 

I didn't find any attitude here (as was mentioned in one of the other reviews), aside from one of product knowledge and passion. I thought that Frank was approachable, and very willing to talk about his business, and also to impart knowledge about German wines. I would highly recommend Wine Depot if you're looking for exceptional wines that you literally CAN'T find anywhere in Tucson. Not even at Total Wine. These wines are hand selected by the owner, who makes barrel tasting trips to Germany, and only brings back his favorites. It's a total niche wine concept in Tucson. The only reason I can't seem to bring myself to give it 5 stars is the location.",2012-02-11 02:59:51
Ch7OZPO4aH3-hvu84DS_0w,_mMGDi9ZSY-r85GAEcsksg,53UwoEvOgZ4xjm4udKNsJQ,1.0,19,8,2,"""Looks like I'm the fool again, I don't like it."" - Tom Petty

Tom was talking about love, but for me, I'm talking about a national chain that simply has not lived up to expectations.  Mind you, some of this is my problem, and so this will be a cautionary tale for you.

This story starts over two years ago when we are remodeling my home.  Lumber Liquidators is having a sale that is very appealing, and they are providing a great deal on financing.  The process begins, and, as I'm a novice with a sort of odd floor plan, I have them come out and measure my house prior to my purchase to ensure that I get the right amount.  The young man arrives at the appointed time, measures, gives me details about all I need, and I show up at the store and buy what he told me to.  I'm spending something like $8,000 for the product alone, on sale.  I finance a huge chunk of the purchase and pay cash for the rest.  

As home, do it yourself remodels go, this project took a long time, and I only recently finished the floor.  Now here is where it get's frustrating.  I've got over $800 worth of extra, un-opened, factory quality, wood left over.  This is beautiful stuff, I have no qualms with the quality of the product.

Now, I know it's been two years, but I'm thinking that there is something the store can do for me.  I was wrong.  No help.  They told me to post it on Craig's list and a builder might want to take it off my hands.  Yea, that's a great plan.  I tell the Assistant Manager on the phone to please brainstorm all possible options and give me a call the next day.  That never happens either.

So, I buy $8,000 worth of floor, I pay $100 to have somebody they recommend do the measuring, I buy what I was told to buy, I store it properly for two years, I install it well, and they will not take back or credit me for the extra unopened boxes of wood.  

You might be wondering, 'what does the purchase order allow?'  This is a great question.  I re-read the agreement, and, sure enough, that's what is written in the fine print.  There is a brief period of time, 90 days or so, in which to return unopened and new products.  This is the part that I need to own.

What was I expecting?  I guess I was expecting compassion, a buyback program, some sense that they understood what I was going through.  In short, something more than I got.  

Is the product good?  Yes, heck I think it's great.

My only hope at this point is that you get to benefit from my frustration.  Read the contract, install in a timely fashion, and don't expect a lot of compassion from the retail outfit.  I might buy their product again, but it's hard to imagine right now.",2012-03-31 13:29:32

So when I heard that BBI was going to start serving Sunday brunch in April I bookmarked it as the spot for Mothers Day brunch. My parents had been for dinner back in late February and had a great experience so they were both excited to hear I made reservations for brunch here. The recent renovations have kept the outside charm but have truly transformed the inside into a modern, classy dining space. When we walked in, I was so pleasantly surprised by how much it opens up. The space is huge with two bars and multiple dining rooms - and laid out beautifully. Everyone dining had a smile on their face and while it was filled with diners when we were there it was not at all too loud or boisterous.  

The menu has a number of savory and sweet options. There is something for everyone. Most importantly, and a new concept to my 'burbs, there are a number of delicious brunch cocktail offerings including a bottomless Bloody Mary option if you so choose. It was Mothers Day so we kept it classy and each enjoyed one Bloody Mary. Our Bloody Marys were served in a bacon salt-Old Bay rimmed Collins glass garnished with a celery stick and a blue crab claw - with an olive in the claw! We all agreed our BMs were decent but too thin and watery. We prefer our bloodies thick and chunky plus the spice factor could have been upped 1 or 1/2 a notch, if they want to be able to appeal to the masses.

Though we didn't order any to start, it's worth mentioning that the shareables (beignets, hot buns, biscuits, coffee cake) are all made in house by their own pastry chef. Moving on - for entrees, my dad ordered the Breakfast Sombrero, my mom the BBI Benedict (with jumbo lump crab and asparagus) and for myself, the Smoked Salmon Flatbread. Everyone's dish had a beautiful presentation and properly portioned. My flatbread, which was served on a wooden board, had the perfect combination of flavors and seasoning. The flatbread had a layer of dill crème fraiche, topped with smoked salmon, capers, red onion and chopped up hard boiled egg. The salmon tasted so unbelievably fresh.

Our server Scott was friendly, professional, and attentive. He was quick to get us what we needed when we needed it and had a great attitude. Also, the manager on duty presented my mom with a rose for Mother's Day at the end of our meal which was a very sweet gesture. 

I can't wait to return to BBI for dinner and/or for apps/raw bar and drinks on the patio next time I'm home during the summer months. Brunch here is just what the Mont Co burbs have needed. If you are visiting Blue Bell, the BBI is the place to go for a wonderful meal in a cozy, classy atmosphere.",2015-05-11 02:26:51

The hubby and i got to go this last friday because the grandparents had taken the kids to dinner. We had a blast! A great impromptu date night. The selection was really quite good. It was a real surprise to see wood fire pizza ovens. There is a lot of bbq and fish options and from what i saw vegetarian options as well. The best part of the whole thing, beside the amazing food and free crazy good smells, you can have a picnic or grab a quick bite. Its so great to see all the families set up on the grass, couples on blankets, people with pop ups and lawn chairs listening to the outdoor band. There are tables as well incase its just a quick bite you are looking for. The whole set up makes the actual wait at the food trucks not bad at all, and it seems less crowded overall because of how spaced out you can get there. How can you lose everyone can get what they want and still eat together! Or better yet share! We had loaded fries (amazing) and kung pow beef with egg rolls (beyond steller). Next time im trying the wine ice cream. I was pleasently surprised to see the train ride operating and little ones having a blast. The splash park area is also near by, a few ft, along with the regular playground. When we were there a free magician was preforming, he seemed funny, good entertainment for the kids. It almost made me sad the kids werent with us. Almost. Lol. The first truck we saw was beer, on tap right off the side of the truck. They had a good selection but we decided on  smithwicks from ceol, which also had beer on tap. They were really friendly and offered us a sample the first time we passed by. You cannot walk everywhere with alcohol it is restricted, signs are posted were prohibited.  Now im not sure if it was crazy crowded with cars and people because of hot august nights, i did see a lot of California plates. I just know the parking situation was pretty bad when we were leaving. We arrived about a half hour after it began and we got a pretty good spot not far from the entrance to the food trucks. However when we left we had been nearly boxed in by others and while driving out we saw other cars clearly blocking people in, parked inappropriately, as well as many cars looking for spots.  Yet in the grass/park and food truck area it didnt seem crowded at all. In conclusion, go to food truck Friday. Its just such a great idea, a wonderful addition to Reno activities. You will definitly have a good time. My only advice would be to go near the start time so you can avoid the only possible negative, which is parking. Added bonus, you will be first in  the food truck line of your choice!",2016-08-09 05:21:36

Food - My girlfriend and I went there on a Saturday night around 6:30pm. We were seated promptly. We both ordered the house margaritas. The margaritas were decent. Very lime-flavored, which is fine, considering it was warm and humid out. I wish there would have been a bit more alcohol in them. 

My girlfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich. She is not a fan of cole slaw, which was placed on the sandwich. I dunno if it was part of the description in the menu, but she scraped it off. The meat was tender, the sauce they used was fantastic. Only down side was that the bottom bun was soggy. It forced her to eat it with a fork. She also ordered the cheese grits. Being from the South, she was very pleased with the grits. 

I ordered the combo platter and chose sausage and brisket. The sausage was very good. The brisket was a little dry, but again, the sauce they used made up for any dryness. The brisket was placed on top of a piece of bread, which, again, was soggy. I also ordered the collard greens, which were delicious. They were cooked in a sauce which had just a hint of spice, which was great. 

Overall, the food was good. And based solely on that, we will go back. 

However...the service was a different story. 

We were promptly seated. The waiter was over within a few minutes to introduce himself and say he'd be back for drinks. He was back in a few minutes and got our drink order. A sort while later, he returned with drinks, and proceeded to get our food order. About 15 minutes later, he returned to inform us that our food was soon up. And that was the last time he spoke to us. We were served our food by another server, which is fine. We ate our food, finished our drinks. At one point my girlfriend pointed out that our waiter came out from the back, dropped off a bottle of ketchup to another table, and returned to the back. I guess multitasking is not his forte. 

Another server cleared our plates. Still nothing. About 10 minutes later, he reappeared and asked if we wanted anything else. We said no, and he disappeared again. we waited another 10 minutes before I had to flag him down to ask for our check. When he returned, he apologized foe the wait. How about apologizing for his non-service. 

Our experience has tainted the place a bit. We hope that our next go-around will have better service.",2009-05-12 12:19:34
xTsd0hZsBCeZF9kxJ2JSeA,xTzyZAKsTrQKhnDUYVSi0A,gkwSfsu1bxyTzTY3XCW0DA,1.0,0,0,0,"We originally reserved a 3-night stay here, but checked out the morning following our arrival and moved to the Four Seasons Biltmore.  Candidly stated, our one night stay at the Canary was unquestionably the worst experience we've had in any hotel anywhere in the world.  Here's the chapter and verse:

1.  Upon arrival, my wife and I wanted to enjoy a cocktail from the honor bar.  Terrific right?  Well, not so fast, there was not one bit of actual glassware in the room...only 2 well-worn plastic wine glasses that were highly distressed & scratched (""suitable for use at the pool"").  We called guest services, and 45 minutes later 4 real glasses arrived...two of which were also disgustingly scratched and were sent back.  The other 2 were barely passable.
2.  But here's the biggie!  Our nearly $500 per night room (plus taxes, etc) was located on the 5th floor (directly under the rooftop pool and party area).  Much to our dismay, we were not informed at check-in that a large wedding and reception was planned for that night on the roof...directly above us.  So when we returned from dinner and began to retire for the night the wedding got underway.  Boy did it every get underway!  The non-stop noise of rap and rock music was absolutely deafening (thump, thump, thump) and we thought the added noise and shaking from the guests dancing above us would bring the ceiling down. This went on for hours!  When we called downstairs to complain, we got a heartfelt apology, but the unbelievable noise continued to rock the room until 2:00 am.  With little or no sleep, we were not happy campers!  Wow...just wow!  I didn't even get a bite of the wedding cake or a glass of champagne.
3.  At 6:15 the following morning, I looked for the coffee maker.  Strangely, there was no coffee maker to be found anywhere in the room.  Room service didn't open until 7:00.  So again we got an apology, and were told upon checkout that coffee makers were available upon request only.  Well, again we were never informed about this at check-in, and come on folks, there should have been a coffee maker or a Keureg in every room period!  Ludicrous, to say the least.
4.  The four-poster bed (while attractive) was just awful as was the quality of the bedding. More of a banana hammock than a bed, we later learned they only change the sheets every third day.  Say what?

The only thing to recommend this hotel, in my humble opinion, is its location close the State Street shops and restaurants.  That's it!   For this kind of rate, guests deserve much more.  When we checked out, management reduced our room rate by a paltry 30%.  They should have comped the room, but didn't.  We were just glad to get out.  We moved down to the Four Seasons Biltmore that recently underwent a complete refresh top to bottom.  Pricey yes, but worth every dime!   A much better choice.  Buyer beware at the Canary.",2016-06-21 18:53:13
S-8nnOsyXPU3H37JMnJy8w,KbztaZxQgkVpiSvDN9H-LQ,MYoRNLb5chwjQe3c_k37Gg,2.0,0,0,0,"Well, my experience with this place is limited thus far to 2 visits.

One went okay when I ordered the Nachos and Cheese, but today didn't go quite as well due to the place being in transition as both the workers and, I think that was also the owner as well who told me much the same.

First off, if you;d like somewhere nice and quiet to sit and eat or have a drink, Thornton's doesn't really fit the bill, as part of the ""transition"" process involves construction work inside the bar during business hours.

In fact, I don't see why they don't consider closing down temporarily until such time as all construction work is completed. Having free reign of the place to get work done more quickly while closed for repairs would make things easier for construction workers, I'm sure.


Second, a while back, Thornton's sent out menu flyers to houses around the area (mine included). But, seems that another part of the ""transition"" involved removing stuff from the menu that was listed in the menu flyers they sent out a while back.


This begs the question as to why it was somehow impossible for them to simply honor their current menu until such time as new menu flyers were made up and sent out to neighborhood residents around here.


At any rate... I had ordered the ""basket of chips"" for $1.50 on the menu I have for them, whereas what came back was the pub chips for twice the price ($3).

*Shrugs shoulders* I have to wonder if this is perhaps some sort of odd form of ""bait and switch"" or something.

I mean, if it is only merely a mistake, then like I said, this mistake and all others involving the 'old menu"" compared to the current one could be easily avoided if they simply honor those old menu prices for all customer orders until such time as they print up new menus.

Granted, to his credit, the owner (I think it was) did offer to refund me... only AFTER a started complaining. But, I did let it go. However, fact remains that prospective customers need to be warned of these discrepancies with the menus flyers that was sent to people, and their current one.

Simply put... while the place will perhaps be better when it is no longer a work in progress, I can only judge based on my visits of how it is now, since it was just earlier today that I swung by to try more stuff from their menu after having some quite good nachos and cheese there yesterday.

In closing, the place is noisy... usually impossible to get in and out the side entrance during construction, and just simply a train wreck when it comes to how well they seem have their act together currently.


Trust me, people... as it currently stands, I really think you can do better as a customer by visiting other bars in and around Port Richmond.",2014-10-17 17:15:12

As the hotel itself has no amenities and since we'd been directed to the restaurant when we inquired at the front desk about ice machines the night before, we thought it was appropriate to ask at the restaurant if we could borrow some cutleries for the room. This, by the way, was okayed by the waitress who also checked with another staff member AND at the hotel desk. Then as we were waiting for the elevator to make our way back to the room, Mr Root confronted us demanding that we hand the cutleries back to him, ""right now"".  He asserted that it was ""his restaurant"", and since he himself was the owner, the cutleries were ""his"".  First of all, we would've totally understood if you'd explained to us that the restaurant operated separately from the hotel (such exclusion seems really unusual for a restaurant that obviously also relies on hotel foot traffic for business), and at least requested that we bring the cutleries back- instead of talking to us as if we were stealing. I mean, what were we going to do with them??? If you are running a restaurant in a hotel lobby and you hadn't worked out any logistical arrangement with the hotel on sharing amenities, with absolutely no indication of this stated anywhere, that only speaks volumes about your own management capabilities. We'd stayed at million other 3+ star hotels around the world and this was the first time we'd ever had this happen, let alone have a so-called ""owner"" confront us. I should mention that we'd had a very pleasant experience at Condesa just last night trying their various Mezcal on the menu, so this felt especially disappointing.  Anyways, Mr. Root was so convinced he was in the right, so much that he refused to reveal his name and continued to argue with us IN THE LOBBY. I don't know how your other partners and your investors would feel about your very public and embarrassing behaviour towards potential patrons, as well as your claiming sole ownership, but I bet they won't be too pleased. Learn some manners and learn to treat people with respect, please! Even other patrons we spoke to after this commotion were commenting on how ridiculous you were. I just feel sorry for the lovely staff that has to work under such conceited leadership. Good luck getting ahead in your career with that attitude of yours, Mr. Greg Root- you'll need it! :)",2019-10-05 02:16:30

It was a vegetarian buffet, a first for me at a wedding reception (and I've been to a lot). I'm not a big fan of vegetarian food (as a meal), so I think it's pretty impressive that Chef's Table was able to cater a spread of vegetarian food that I thought was quite good. Some items, in particular, were fantastic.

The cocktail hour took place at the ceremony site, Chinese Christian Church and Center in Chinatown North/Callowhill (Vine Campus) (https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinese-christian-church-and-center-philadelphia). Chef's Table set up a bar with two bartenders and a small self-serve buffet of hors d'oeuvres just inside the entrance of the sanctuary.

Cocktail hour menu:
* Antipasto tray - soppressata, pepperoni, sharp Provolone, Italian Fontina, grilled artichoke hearts, marinated olives, button mushrooms, and artichoke hearts
* Crudite tray - assorted raw and blanched vegetables
* Mezza tray - stuffed grape leaves and green olives with lemon and coriander, hummus, baba ghanoush, muhammara

I thought the spread of hors d'oeuvres was great. The foods were very fresh and healthy. I like eating raw veggies and appreciated the variety that included not only standard veggies like broccoli and grape tomatoes, but also endives and beets. The stuffed grape leaves were scrumptious, but the star of the show was the muhammara. Muhammara is a Middle Eastern red pepper and walnut spread. Chef's Table's version was delicious, full of flavor, with an appetizing, almost creamy, consistency.

The dinner reception took place down the street at the Asian Arts Initiative (https://www.yelp.com/biz/asian-arts-initiative-philadelphia). Chef's Table once again had a two-man bar plus four self-serve dinner stations set up and spread out along the perimeter of the venue.

Dinner reception menu:

Pasta station
* Roasted stone fruit salad - arugula and mixed greens, mango vinaigrette
* Rigatoni with fresh pomodoro sauce - balsamic caramelized onions
* Penne primavera - garlic and olive oil with garden vegetables

Jackfruit ""crab"" cake station
* Sauteed spinach
* Pakora potato cake - peas and cauliflower

Middle East station
* Moroccan braised seitan - tomatoes, zucchini, yellow squash, peppers, onions, golden raisins, and chickpeas over jasmine rice
* Cajun-spiced butternut squash - tomato caper

Dessert station
* Almond pistachio baklava
* Fruit tarts

My favorite dish, without a doubt, was the roasted stone fruit salad. I got that dish three times because the peaches were ripe and incredibly juicy and sweet. So good. I also like arugula and greens, so it was a nice combination. The most memorable dish to me was the jackfruit ""crab"" cake. I'm allergic to crab, so I enjoyed being able to eat this version of ""crab"" cake. The use of ingredients like jackfruit and offering menu items like muhammara, Moroccan braised seitan, and baklava really showed off the breadth of Chef's Table's offerings. I thought the bride did a wonderful job choosing a menu that was diverse and showed off a number of cuisines from around the world. My second favorite dish was the collection of desserts, all three. They were terrific, high quality. Everything was presented nicely. Overall, I found the dinner menu to be creative, unique, and tasty.

The two bartenders were polite and friendly. As an out-of-town guest, they definitely didn't seem like the stereotypical Philadelphians to me. They were warm and hospitable, both at cocktail hour and at the reception. That kind of hospitality makes a big difference to me. They made Chef's Table look good.",2019-07-28 10:32:19

Then this is the single most important detail for you: kids ARE allowed until 7pm.  I can only imagine the debauchery that most go on after 7pm that the kid are sent home and the adult madness begins.

We were really excited when we found out Streets of St Charles was expanding their pedigree with a frozen, boozy drink shop that boasted drinks of a higher caliber than just a slurpee with shots and we were not disappointed.  

After verifying that our 6 year old was ok to go on premises we found out they actually offer a handful of non-alcoholic drinks which was great because we didn't want our kiddo to sit there and not have a treat too.  We got him the Mixed Berry Mint smoothie, which was quite good on its own and our son loved it.

We started with two flights- I love that they have flights because each drink is so different from the next it really let's you get experience the multiple personalities that Narwhal's drinks are.  We got the Banana Dave, Chocolate Mudslide, Mayan Junglebird, Strawberry Peach Bellini, Orange Dreamsicle and Strawberry Basil Lemonade.  

These drinks will knock your socks off!  I entered this place thinking ""oh they just dispense these premade frozen drinks"" but they actually took great care in the preparation to make sure they were not just gorgeous but were garnished appropriately with all the proper accents described in the menu.  We watched as whipped cream and orange zest was careful sprinkled onto the dreamsicle, and chocolate shavings dusted onto the top of our mudslide.  Top notch!

The two favorites- that we actually went back for full sized seconds were the Orange Dreamsicle and the Banana Dave.  They tasted exactly as described, the creaminess of the whipped cream was a perfect blend with the orange.  The Strawberry Basil Lemonade was a perfect hot summer day drink with the basil being an unexpected compliment to the Lemonade.  You could taste real bananas in the Banana Dave.

I love the roll up garage style doors to the outside patio seating and that they had fire pits to warm you up after your chilly drinks!  For a place that does one thing- frozen boozy drinks- they do it exceptionally well!  I can't wait to go back!

FYI you can pick up takeout food from elsewhere in Streets of St Charles and bring it into Narwhal's!",2019-08-30 23:36:52
OXQrlxlVjQL3ToFOjoCB5w,0-hb63A9uWjR1YIyVMu6rg,P06X_EjExSNgaHRQESmx2A,3.0,2,0,1,"I signed up for F45 looking for another routine to switch off with my usual OrangeTheory classes over the summer.  I had seen the advertisements on facebook and watched the videos and it looked like a high energy and exciting (or at least, not boring) way to get in a good workout.  So I signed up for a one month trial membership and found out that it is a good, high energy workout, but it wasn't for me.

F45 has 2 different categories of workout - strength and endurance.To be honest, I didn't see much difference in the workouts though the strength ones did probably involve more weights instead of body weight exercises.  Anyway, within those categories, they have multiple different workouts, ranging from 9 stations per workout up to 21.  Yes, 21 stations.  I think I only saw one workout with that many exercises, but 12-18 was very common.  There are a lot of kettleball, sandbag, and similar weighted workouts, and a lot of jumping exercises as well.  There's ropes, sleds, agility, and more exercises I can remember.  Some workouts you do for 20-60 seconds and 1 set before moving around the stations, other times you do multiple sets of different lengths and only 1 time through the stations.  They mix it up well and each workout is different.

Class starts with the coach going through each station and workout and then assigning each student to a station to start in.  Screens at the front of the class show an animated athlete doing each workout and clocks count down each set and tell you whether to stay at your station or move to the next one.  Each class is 45 minutes total.

Pros:  Its a good workout.  You will sweat and you will exhaust yourself.  You will workout to muscle failure if you're doing the workout correctly and using the right weights.  Also, you have to give the coaches credit - there's typically two coaches once the classes get to a certain size and they walk around the class and coach everyone.  If they see you doing something wrong or if you have bad form, then they will stay with you and coach you until you get it right.  And if you're doing it right, they will simply be there to encourage and motivate you.

Cons:  It's a lot of jumping and moving.  I didn't think it was good for my knees though I am sure F45 would disagree.  But my biggest complaint is that it is just too much in one workout.  The coach has to fly through the demonstrations to the point that the workout is difficult if not impossible to follow and remember, so you're getting the workout from an animated video.  And you spend so little time at certain workouts - sets might be as short as 20 seconds that sometimes you barely have time to do a few reps.  If F45 was a half dozen or maybe as many as 10 or 12 at most workouts, then I think it would be better, and if there was less impact on your knees and joints, it would be better.  

I'll say this - I understand people liking it, especially those who get bored easily and I would encourage you to give it a try if you're looking for something different.  I can appreciate that my kind of workout may not be yours and this was far from terrible - you might like it.  But for my money, it's not as good as OrangeTheory or other HIIT workouts.",2019-10-10 02:09:29
MlwbbtnQKlUcoqMXt8Ch2g,3qOGw6oYGGfM8ZCzZLatEg,R8ZTEHX2CA4g5pIEBQ8AVQ,2.0,3,0,0,"We got married at Elings Park in Santa Barbara at the end of September. Booking Donna as our planner was one of the first things we did, and initially we were both very excited to work with her. We signed up with Donna for basic wedding coordination.  In the beginning, Donna was very helpful with finding vendors, and was pretty responsive to our questions. I was totally comfortable with booking vendors, and was looking forward to Donna taking over as we got closer to the wedding.

Unfortunately, as we got closer to the wedding, I became less confident with Donna's abilities. She was half an hour late to our walk through with our caterer, even though we had confirmed the time with her three days before. In the six weeks before the wedding, I did not feel that Donna was being responsive to our emails and questions, and she was a little defensive when I tried to address these issues with her. I don't need someone to respond to an email within an hour, but a response within one to two business days is reasonable, and I often found that it took Donna one week to respond to my emails. She did not send along our complete list of our music preferences to our DJ, so it's a good thing that our DJ told us about that before the wedding day. I was also surprised to be contacted by three of my vendors with last minute questions 48 hours before the wedding, because I was under the impression that Donna would be in charge of talking to vendors during that time. 

The rehearsal did not go as smoothly as I would have liked. I feel that it could have been a more positive and personal experience if Donna had asked us how we wanted the ceremony to go before we got to the rehearsal. Instead, we were working out some of the details during the rehearsal. Even the people in my bridal party noticed that Donna was not really listening to what we wanted during the rehearsal.

I know that Donna was busy working during the actual wedding, which we really appreciated. However, she did not catch a pretty big issue with our caterer (the toppings for our tacos did not get put out), and there were a few issues with coordinating the busses back to the hotel at the end of the night. I think that we were just expecting her to be more helpful in the 6 weeks leading up to the wedding, and were disappointed when she did not do that. She is more of a day-of planner than a ""day-of plus 8 weeks"" wedding planner.",2014-11-02 21:18:43

My biggest issue is with the customer service... or should I say lack thereof. Employees literally sleeping at their station, and then I had the (dis)pleasure of dealing with my nail tech. 
I'm not sure if I'm spoiled, but when I go to a nail salon I expect to be pampered, or at least be relaxed.  
I come in, and I'm getting over a cough, so when so cough my tech goes ""You smoke too much""
I laugh because I do have a sense of humor, and normally I don't get easily upset by workers in any customer service position, but this visit got annoying fast.
I mention that I'm tired, and I must have set off something in this man, because he takes it upon himself to wake me up. How? By repetitively hitting me with a nail file, poking my hand, flicking me on my new acrylics, pulling my fingers all while saying ""Wake up""
I laughed the first few times, but as the visit went on it became annoying and almost felt malicious. Like can you stop f&$@ing touching me and do my nails? Especially while you're rushing them? It came to the point I was giving him death glares in the eyes and I was ready to leave, especially after one intense glare I get a ""what?"" from his rude self. 

When I tell him how short I wanted them, and how big the French I wanted, I get ""Huh?"" Sorry but the proper response is excuse me or anything remotely polite.

He was so rude, just saying ""wash your hands"", and basically barking at me for everything he needs me to do. No sense of service at all. 

I come back from washing my hands and he just says ""25""
I purposely pulled out all the money I was going to tip him and just hand him the 25 and sat through my personal hell for another 15 minutes.

Maybe if you like rude service, being touched by a stranger repetitively, or rushed nails this place is probably a dream come true.

Disappointing that it's 2 minutes from my boyfriends house and you'd expect better from Tampa Palms salon, at least some courtesy.

I'll be staying with my usual salon even with the long commute. Try Ninis at least there you can keep your fingers intact by the end of the manicure.",2018-06-30 04:40:42

And this pinks is in the KOP mall so it's an excuse to get my husband to come shopping with me and then go here whenever I want. 

I knew that they wouldn't have as many choices at this location as the main one in LA. But there were a few of them I was expecting them to have here but didn't, mainly the Philly cheesesteak hot dog. I went with the mulholland drive dog with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, nacho cheese, and bacon. The hot dog tasted good but the toppings didn't really work together well. The mushrooms weren't grilled they were the nasty marinated mushrooms that come in a jar that a lot of pizza shops use. And the bacon was kind of soggy, I would have rather had crispy bacon bites instead. The sandwich was drowning in nacho cheese. I'll have to make sure I substitute with a different cheese if I ever come here again. My husband got  a hot dog with bacon, chili and shredded cheese on it and that one was a lot better. 

The layout of this restaurant is not great either. It's in the center of the food court with a barrier surrounding it. If there's even a slight line it makes it very difficult to order because there's nowhere for the line to go, you have to stand right up against people's tables. I had to try to squeeze past this line and people's tables to get to the soda machine as well. And they were literally out of every kind of soda except diet soda. No regular soda at all; no coke, no sprite, no orange soda, No Dr Pepper either. I ended up going with some diet cherry sprite that was nasty because there was a huge line behind me and I didn't know what else to pick. The cashier at the counter should have informed us that they were out of soda beforehand, I wouldn't have ordered it then. And it's ridiculous to run out of that many all at once. 

We came here like a week or so after it opened so maybe they needed more time to work the kinks out. I'm not opposed to giving this place another try if we happen to be at the mall and hungry, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back either.",2019-02-10 16:29:56

I found this place to be a very authentic Irish bar.  It's not just some green-painted bar with a flag slapped up on the wall.  They have Irish beers, foods, and even SNACK foods.  They have Magner's instead of Strongbow. They sell Tayto's (which I've never seen outside of import shops and Ireland) and Cadbury's candies (I went crazy on the Crunchies). For the breakfast in the morning, they definitely got the bones right - canned beans, grilled tomatoes, brown bread, sausages, black and white pudding, and rashers.  Their choice of breakfast meats doesn't seem too great, though.  I always buy Galtee or Shannon products (Galtee of course is imported, but Shannon is a very close American product, and back when foot & mouth was in issue, all we could get). Whatever it was that they served me was not what I'm used to. I couldn't eat the white pudding or the sausages (I thought they were gross). I didn't try the black pudding simply because I don't like black pudding.  The rashers were fine but not as good as the brands I mentioned. The brown bread tasted like it came right out of my mother's kitchen.

We were definitely too old to be in the bay on Saturday night (we're all around 30, give or take a couple of years). It's totally a douche bar. Its dark, and loud, and it's not very clean, and it's full of popped collars and vapid expressions. However, we found a dark corner in the back, in a fairly empty room (the place is nice and big) and just took it on over.  They had board games, so we played Domino's (don't be jealous of how cool we are). 

Big, huge, awful complaint: they had ONE waitress.  For the whole, massive place.  Inside and out.  This poor girl was running around as fast as she could but still, through no fault of her own, took 30 minutes to bring us drinks.  That is the worst management I've ever heard of. She let us know that this is how they do it - one waitress on weekend nights. Why even have waitresses at that point?  The management must be as big a douche as the patrons.

If I had to sum it up, I'd say that it's a GREAT bar in terms of authenticity, but it's all wasted on the clientele and poor management.",2009-08-10 16:27:15
OhTQTqaOX-x_2XfLH7hzqA,SeTSsi60-5RD4E6Fu_oEBA,PccIfmGRl179W0iRaO4cfg,2.0,0,2,0,"I read the reviews on yelp before I made appointments for my friend and myself.  We went to have facials, and I also scheduled a massage.  The facility is just beautiful.  Bring a suit if you come here, as you will want to use the coed pools on the 4th floor.  It is very lovely up there.  You can also spend the entire day here on the day of your appointment.  Do not expect the standard spa quiet zone, however, and that is my complaint.
We went in and were shown the facilities.  I came early enough to spend some time in the steam room - nice.  I then had a facial with Gina, and it was the best facial I have ever had.  She was wonderful - very knowledgeable and her technique was superb.  I then had a massage with Julie.  She was very nice, and the massage (Swedish) was fine., although she was a little too chatty for me to really relax.   After my massage, I had a great shower, then went over to the changing area to dress.  When I got there, I heard some huge bursts of laughter.  I thought that was very weird, as everyone knows that spas are a total quiet zone.  I heard more loud laughter, and decided to check it out.  I followed the noise to the inner reception desk.  There were two employees at the desk, folding towels and hooting it up like there was no tomorrow.  I looked at them, and they looked at me, but did not stop their fun.  I went back and continued to dress.  My friend came around the corner, and the first thing she said to me was "" Do you hear all that?""  And I said ""Yep - I sure do.""  Another spa guest looked at us, and glanced toward the noise, and said "" I can't believe that racket.""
I was pretty miffed.  I called the spa to speak to a manager.  I got  her voice mail.  I left a message, and got no call back until the following day.  She left me a message, so I called back right away, and again got her voice mail.  I was willing to wait until I spoke with her before I yelped, but it has now been three more days, ( a week now since my visit) and she has not called me back.  I am so sad to know that management does not care about the conduct of its employees enough to teach them that the spa should be a quiet zone for guests, and that should include employees trying to make as little noise as possible.  This manager does not care to get back to me to find out what my complaint is.  I am surprised at that.  I do want to go back to Gina for more facials, but I am really hoping that a manager will get back to me and correct the loud noise of the employees.  I am totally willing to upgrade my score if I can get a response from them.  I hope they don't leave me hanging.  The low score I am giving is due to 1, the employee noise, and 2, no call back from management to address the problem.  I did notice two others complaining about the staff being noisy, one was back in Sept, and it seems that they have yet to correct this problem.",2011-03-01 01:53:44

We've been to Santa Barbara before and have stayed elsewhere but this was our first visit to the West Beach Inn. The hotel is older, but has been modernized. The front desk staff were really friendly and helpful. The grounds are beautiful, including the pool area. We loved the little loveseat with table and had our wine and cheese each evening there. The service staff were sooo nice. One night they knocked on our door and asked if they could offer us some chocolates. Yum! We walked to the harbor to the west in about 10 minutes, and the beach adjacent to there was virtually empty except for us and the birds. There is a little place there that sells fish and chips, it was so good and about half the price than on the wharf. The room was comfortable, and has a/c which most places there don't. It was welcome, because even if it's only 75 outside, if there is no breeze, it can feel hot in the room. The shower was amazing for me, because being 6'-2"" most hotel showers have me leaning to use them. But our showerhead was up at least 7'! I loved it. Our Queen Room was on the 2nd floor, and had a partial ocean view beyond the nice grounds with flowering hibiscus. Maybe they upgraded us for my birthday? Either way, we loved it. You can walk to the wharf in about 5 minutes, and take the shuttle from there up State Street, or walk. We visited the Manuscript museum which is free, and highly recommended!  We usually took the shuttle all the way up State Street, then walked back. They offer a bike rental coupon for a place near the wharf. Something for us to try next visit, which I hope is soon. When we checked out, we mentioned that we weren't leaving town for a few more hours and the front staff offered their fridge for us to keep our extra wine cool. I can't say enough nice things about this place. Thank you everyone there for making my birthday getaway special. But I think they just make everyone's visit there special. It's that kind of place.  oh, watch out for a certain seagull with a taste for cheese and crackers. Trust me, he is smarter than you expect.",2016-09-12 20:19:57
XMFtrceiOltSzoWZVUqCGw,csCnf5muoHfFdqVsptDAOg,9rJorsbB7jk0-rrrKF-Xvg,3.0,4,2,1,"Longwood Family Restaurant is relatively new to the area and as always, I like to visit a locally owned establishment to spend my hard earned money to keep the tax money locally (and help out the small business owner). We were on our way home from church on Easter Sunday and decided to stop in with the family for lunch. They were moderately busy but had room to squeeze two adults and two toddlers in. This is an OK place, quaintly decorated and the staff seemed pretty friendly. The menu is something short of a movie transcript. Generally, if you have a wide variety in your menu, it is pretty tough to have great dishes available and everything suffers. I learned this from watching my fav celeb chef, Gordon Ramsey. They offer everything from breakfast to dinner and appetizers. While reviewing the lengthy scribe, we ordered our beverages. They brought out these monster cups of OJ for the kids. Seems like a waste to give a kid that much juice and offer it as a ""kids size"". Not to mention that my 2 year girl spilled half of down the front of her dress, but I blame mom for not paying attention on that one. I ordered iced tea and it was delivered with almost no ice in it. It annoys the every loving piss out of me when you order a glass of iced freaking tea and it shows up with little or no ice. I mean seriously, if you are going to do that, please don't make me ask you for a spare glass of ice. So we order my wife breakfast (eggs and scrapple), french dip for yours truly, a burger for the boy and chicken fingers for the babe. Not 15 minutes goes by and BAM! Our food is delivered. Pretty fast service if you ask me and very impressed. Now I don't mind getting a nice sized meal when I eat out, but I am pretty sure this place is used to serving lumberjacks and truck drivers on a regular basis. We pretty much received a platter of food to eat (more waste, yes I hate waste if you have not caught on yet). Everything was pretty much spot one, no errors. Now it is time to eat. This is where things sort of go down hill for me. Breakfast is breakfast...it's pretty hard to screw that up and my wife was happy. My french dip started out well, but halfway into it, I started to get the real shitty part of the roast beef (fat and cartilage). That is pretty gross. I have worked in the restaurant business before and have probably made 100s of french dips and I never put that crap on a plate. It really is irresponsible and nasty. It's sort of like putting the butt of a head of lettuce in a salad, just wrong. Out side of that, it was OK. The burger for the boy was about the size of his head and the kid has a huge noggin (more waste) and the burger was not cooked all the way through. He never would have eaten it all, so I just cut off the done parts for him. I did try it and it was just OK. Next up, chicken fingers. This is the part of the meal that every dad hope their kid does not finish. Gives us a reason to ""help"" finish up anything the child does not. There were 3 chicken strips which were rather large (again from the kids menu, maybe the lumberjacks bring their kids in too?) but no complaint here based off my previous comment on assisting. They had absolutely no flavor at all and could be compared to eating deep fried tofu (which also has no flavor). The french fries were all good, so they have that going for them. So overall, I offer 3 stars as an olive branch and hopes that maybe they can slim the menu down and focus on some of their popular items (whatever those are). Do you really need a cheese steak on your menu? There are a bazillion other places within 10 miles that serve them and are probably better than yours. Focus please. We will probably return, but for breakfast only.",2010-05-13 19:39:03

Back in October I paid off my card using cash, luckily I kept the receipts, however, last night I went to make a purchase using my Macy's card and it was being declined. I called Macy's customer service this morning and I was told I still owed a previous balance. I have receipts showing I made a payment in the exact amount that is owed. This is so unbelievably frustrating....  The cashier that took my cash payment is the same lady who told me I HAD TO APPLY FOR A AMX Macy's card (last week) in order to purchase a gift card?!?!?! Never have I had this happen to me, but two days later the same lady told my 17 year-old sister she too HAD to apply for a AMX card in order to purchases a gift card (along with a shirt)! My sister is on my fathers account and is SEVENTEEN!! My sister believes the cashiers name was Rosie or Rose (short Filipino lady) . Since my sister is on my fathers account, she obviously knows his SSN# (which is required when making a purchase without the card) so she entered the information because this lady told her ""In order to make the purchase you must apply, otherwise I cannot go through with the transaction."" SO she applied just as I did because we just wanted to make a purchase and leave. Earlier this week we both received letters from Macy's apologizing that we were NOT approved for the AMX card. I NEVER WANTED ONE!  I ran into a manager on my way out of the store last night and I expressed my frustration to her, hopefully something is done about this. I'm not accusing the woman of taking and pocketing my cash but maybe she needs to be re-trained on how to apply payments and not FORCE people to enter their information to make any type of purchase but also forcing them to apply for a credit card at the same time. I don't understand how the lady made my sister apply for the AMX card using my fathers information! Isn't this fraud?!?!?!?!? After 67 minutes on the phone with Macy's this morning, I'm assuming this issue wont be resolved for a few weeks after we mail in letters and receipts. To the three girls who stayed and helped me out last night, I appreciate you! and I give you girls 5 stars!

I have made use of the online ordering and pick-up more than a few times and it has been relatively without issues - until today. I order mid-morning. There are a couple of sheets of drywall so why not let the young guys wrestle it. I get the notice at 9:42 that my order is in process. I have more than a few things to do since we just moved in a month ago, but I usually get a ready to pick up email in an hour or so. I have some errands in that area so I figure SURELY by the time I get through it will be ready. I decide to give them a little more time and eat at the Chinese buffet close by - more on that later. Notice I said buffet...this should take an hour or more or when the ask me to leave. I'm full, I'm MSG'd to the max and sleepy, grumpy and a couple more dwarfs I can't think of at the moment. I amble over to Lowe's and park in the ""15 MINUTE ONLY PICK-UP"" (more on that later on in this very review). 

Well it is lunch time at Lowe's, too. The only people manning the customer service area have little to no experience with the online pick-up process. I have my order number, I have my phone number, I give them my witness protection name - just kidding. ""Sir - it never got release to be pulled."" - whatever that means. She is not familiar with the ""new system"". She calls someone, who calls someone, who is at lunch. ""If you don't mind waiting we will have it ready ASAP."" As Soon As People get back from lunch? As Soon As Purgatory freezes over? I'll be over here in the patio furniture area - they will email me - right? ""Of course!"" Should have went for the hammock. I wait. I wait some more. I wander around the store. I switch price tags on items. I put ""Don't forget to flush"" signs on the display commodes and hide behind the doors moaning ""Let me out!""

I may have made all that up. I walk by one of the big blue carts that has a few of the items I ordered on it, abandoned in the aisle. I wander toward the front knocking over displays as I go. When I get to customer service I count at least 8 employees - and one me - unless you count my other personality. There must be a class on how to avoid eye contact as one is coming, one going, two on the phone, one picking his nose and one flirting with the new cashier. I finally talk to one guy who says they probably have to something, something, something - then walks away - I assumed to help, but no...

A lady accidentally made eye contact - ""I want to cancel my online order and get a refund on my card - I have been here over an hour and a half waiting on items I could have walked in, bought and walked out in less than thirty minutes!

cHoLfJTB74_u47H16x81PQ,AY86PSwIpMUHfn6oli3xYA,qJxOT7bo-PdW1-xx3nK8SQ,1.0,0,0,0,"I dont normally write reviews but for the fact that I had such a bad experience here, I just had to. My co-workers and I decided to have lunch at JJ Bootleggers during our lunch break due to its infamous burgers. As excited as we were to try it for the first time, we were highly disappointed by the hour wait we had just to get our appetizers after ordering them even though the restaurant was visibly not busy. We had not seen our server during the hour wait, where she couldve talked to us and confirmed that our food would be coming shortly, but unfortunately we were forced to look for her and make assumptions ourselves that she forgot to ring our orders in. Dont get me wrong, the food was absolutely great. However, the service was horrendous. I've never had an experience at a restaurant where I was hesitant on asking my server for simple things, such as getting salt, blue cheese and ketchup, in fear that she will take her time getting it and by the time she gets back, my food will be done. Everything we asked for were very simple tasks and basic customer server, but it seems as if our server just blew it off and we would have to wait for long periods of time to get it. On top of it all, my friend had ordered a 2 Shirley Temples (for those who dont know what it is, it is a virgin drink that consists of Sprite and Grenadine) and as we got our checks, we noticed that our server had added 2 shots of Bankers Club Vodka. When we asked about these additional charges, she said that it comes with the Shirley Temple, but that was not the case because that drink should have been virgin! I dont know what kind of bar/restaurant would automatically add alcohol to a virgin drink without asking first. Instead of compensating for the 2 additional charges that we did not ask for, our server simply just said ""Oh.. Well, thats how the bartender made it""........ If it wasnt for the fact that we had to go back to work right after we had eaten, we would have talked to the manager right away and contested everything that we had to experience along with getting the wrong orders on our checks when we asked to split checks. Everyone at our table were servers and we totally understand that mistakes happen because thats the restaurant industry, however we never talked to and made comfortable about all the mistakes our server was making, and for that I had to write this review in hopes that the customer service improves because the food itself is phenomenal but that cant be the only good thing upholding this restaurant.",2018-12-08 15:01:15
Ma79-oHDIBoJmp749Utkyw,lb3MOEXbTKhv0kKTulh5eQ,83IeQHroXEctmMpK19TJKw,5.0,1,3,1,"When there's a need for ""me time"", I strongly recommend the Richel D' Ambra Spa & Salon at the Ritz Carlton for a truly luxurious, ultimate spa and salon experience. While physical treatment is a nice gift for our bodies and senses, it is important to realign our energies and minds as well. There is no other spa in the city that is more sensually uplifting and spiritually elevating than the Richel D' Ambra Spa & Salon, a renowned hotel spa located on the beautiful Avenue of the Arts, the city's most cultured and aesthetically-defined boulevard.

A few years ago, I discovered the Richel D' Ambra Spa & Salon by chance while searching for the ""best of the best"" experience as a Mother's Day gift for my mom (and as a birthday gift for myself.) So of course, after reading reviews after reviews, it was not surprising that I eagerly booked a facial and a massage with the city's ""Best of Philly"" spa.

Appropriately situated on the Avenue of the Arts, the beautiful Ritz Carlton sits magnificently like a Greek God (or Goddess). Upon entrance, my spirit wandered towards the skies as my eyes traced six beautifully-carved, perfectly spaced Ionic columns that graciously balanced a neoclassical couple of entablature and pediment. 

I recall my first experience at the Richel D' Ambra Spa & Salon. It was a sensational memory that I would love to continue reliving over and over again. The experience is truly intimate and exclusive. Located on the third floor of the historic hotel, the spa's atmosphere effortlessly beckons guests for a visit. Even before our arrival at the spa during our first visit, I recall the aroma of essential oils and peacefulness of relaxing music greeted us just before the museum-worthy elevator doors opened and led us to the spa and just before the gorgeous front desk concierge stood up to welcome us. Her name was Sara, dressed in a beautiful black dress and heels, her hair, nails, glowing skin, and perfect posture were evidence we should aspire to visit the Richel D' Ambra Spa & Salon as often as possible! She pleasantly checked us in and confirmed our treatments: a customized facial for my mom and a signature massage for myself.

The locker room was a convenient walk from the front desk. Our robes were already neatly tucked in our lockers as if the staff knew we desperately needed the world's plushest robes. (By the way, I have searched all over the city and Internet for these robes because I would like to purchase one to use at home. The robes at the Richel D' Ambra Spa & Salon are most definitely the fluffiest and softest I have ever felt! Every once in a while, the spa will run out of robes and have to substitute with hotel robes, but if you're lucky and book your treatment early enough in the day... you're pretty much guaranteed to have a Richel D' Ambra robe waiting for you in your locker.)

I can't decide if our next experience was the best part or if it was as great as our treatments. My mom and I were invited to experience the Relaxation Lounge. The lounge was appropriately, dimly lit. We were offered complimentary tea and coffee (or champagne, wine, or fresh, citrus water. Have your pick, depending on your mood and level of fanciness!) I opted for a hot cup of Earl Grey while my mother sipped champagne. We kicked back and enjoyed a harmonic session of complimentary audio therapy, eyes closed, while we waited for our treatments.
 
By the time our audio therapy session concluded, our therapists greeted us and walked us to our rooms. Everything was perfectly timed -- from the doormen greeting us at entrance to the front desk concierge directing us to the spa to the ding of the elevator bell... and now to the synchronized warm welcomes from our therapists. It's as if the world of the Ritz Carlton only knows how to operate in this fashion.

As my massage therapist, Nancy Connell, expertly eased my tensions away, my mom was in another room next door enjoying the benefits of a custom facial with senior therapist, Regina Ricci, who kindly recommended facial care techniques and products after her treatment. 

Since then, I've visited the Richel D' Ambra Spa & Salon many times after and have had the privilege to experience the different treatments and extremely talented therapists. My favorite menu item is the Aria Signature Treatment, an aromatherapeutic massage experience that soothes not only the body but also mind and soul through a beautiful sensory journey with essential oils. 

If you're looking for a well-trained, highly-knowledgeable massage therapist, I recommend Harlan Ewers, an expert in sports injury and sports massage, previously trained in New York, he brings years of experience and energy from the world-renowned Mandarin Oriental Hotel Spa.

There is no other acquaintance or experience in the world that parallels the warm welcomes and indescribable signature of the Ritz Carlton; and this specific Philadelphia location would not be complete without the Richel D' Ambra Spa & Salo",2014-10-06 15:34:38
QNicxLlueOOrXUjjsQYt6g,F3lu1icxJX5A5tCw-jVpTg,ilMm5DJviWLqakujmBFGvQ,5.0,5,0,2,"It's about damn time I do an update for Shady J's....seriously!

Where to start? Gosh, I don't even know. This was my go-to bar during the summer of 2011 when I was working full-time as an intern in St. Charles. The best part about this place is that you can be from damn near any walk of life, walk in here, and still have a really great time. I've brought so many different groups of friends or just one friend at a time and they really enjoyed it. The wall decor is hilariously random but not in a TGI Friday's sense. More like in a biker bar in almost-the-ghetto-sense. (But really, the area it's in isn't great. It's like just getting into the sketchy parts of Broadway. But I find the run-down buildings, graffiti and overall urban decay really romantic in a bizarre, inexplicable sense.)

The service is top-notch here. The owner recognized me after only two visits and the bartenders started to recognize me too as I would come in often for just a cheese pizza and a beer or three. Best of all? Jack always offers to walk me back to my car if I come by myself at night or with a girlfriend at night. Super courteous guy, and subtly funny as well. Once I was in the bar area with Sean eating a pizza right before they closed and he said ""take your time, there's no rush."" He usually sits at a table in the bar area with his wife sipping a glass of wine. I didn't take him for a wine type of guy but hey, that just makes him even more awesome, right?! ;)

Oh and...I am not really a self-proclaimed lover of STL style pizza or Provel cheese by any means, but holy shit, I really dig on the pizzas at this place. I don't know what it is about them but I can't resist a Shady Jack's cheese pizza and a beer. Select 55, even, and I can't believe I just wrote that! :-O

I heard they do private parties and events here as well and I think I just might have to rent out one of the private rooms downstairs for a party sometime, although I have no idea who I'd invite. I wanted to have my 23rd birthday here but it was exam time, as usual (stupid December birthdays) so I alas, I couldn't! 

Anyway...I really hope that if I am still living in St. Louis when I get my first motorcycle, that I can take it to Shady J's and ride it up all badass like the other bikers who come here do. But yeah. In the meantime I will just come here for some food, casual chattin', and sport-game-watchin'. Go sports!

P.S.: This bar is not for the faint of heart, that's for sure. I once had a guy talk to me at the bar who just got out of prison. Hahaha. I am not joking. But it makes the place all the more interesting!",2012-03-03 07:41:52
gYydfzpfCEDY65LgkuumcA,oXdYPO7ssswuL6A6eXQ6EQ,gKavBVCK5G0cPJ9moV6iOA,1.0,0,0,0,"We're visiting from out of town and came here just because we're seafood fans. In terms of service/quality, they were out of half the things we ordered - oysters, sausage, local draft beer. The booth seat I was seated in wobbled and was duct taped. The entree I eventually got was way smaller than I expected based on the price.

But what really upset me was that my wallet went missing while I was here, and I discovered it when I walked to another bar and went to pull out my ID and saw that the wallet was gone. Of course we come back to South Street and even though the staff looked at our seat and the floor to see if it had fallen they were mostly just defensive and not at all sympathetic or apologetic.  Not even a ""wow I'm so sorry this happened I know this must be really frustrating!  I hope you find it!"" like any normal person would do.  It seemed like once we saw that it hadn't just fallen on the floor they expected me to just shrug it off and walk away, and I had to insist on talking to a manager who again just shifted the booth around to look at the floor and said he trusts his employees.  They didn't even write down a description of it just to note it in case someone turned it in or anything like that.  Even the second bar that we went to, the one where I realized I didn't have it, wrote down a description and my phone number in case it turned up.

I asked a couple of other guests who had been sitting next to us and facing us the whole time if they had noticed anything or had been able to see the wallet at any point, and they just kept telling me that they all know and trust each other and come there all the time and again were just defensive and not at all helpful.  They kept telling me the place is a really local bar where everyone knows each other and is really friendly but A) I wasn't impressed by their interpretation of the word ""friendly"" and B) them all knowing each other doesn't mean jack for me being from out of town. I wasn't even asking if they had the wallet just whether or not they'd seen anything and they immediately assumed I was accusing them of taking it.

The one moment I got distracted and took my eyes off my bag was when I was trying to get up from the wobbly (and, again, duct-taped) booth and there were people all around me so it was really difficult - so that may have been when the wallet either fell out of the bag and got picked up or was just taken out of my bag.  I definitely had it in South Street because I ordered a drink and showed my ID.  But the managers/owners we talked to suggested we call the police and gave us the nonemergency line, and they insisted they'd help us talk to the police and give a statement as witnesses. But then the whole time we were speaking with the police officer the managers walked by multiple times without stopping to say anything.

It was already just a meh experience before all this drama, but if this is their idea of a friendly local spot with a regular crowd then hard pass.",2018-06-15 01:45:43
OrkJN8-Ij0vTRDAswasqNQ,SFeRBYSOTXokMxUZuIUfTQ,Vq_t3cWyj33IdHDPGw7iOg,5.0,0,0,0,"Hello fellow Yelpers.  I am writing this rebuttal in response to Kitty K's 1 star rating of AMS Entertainment... and more specifically me (Gabe Amparan).  

Let me preface this with stating I have been djing for over 7 years and have never once had such negative feedback from a guest.  I have a feeling there was an obvious miscommunication and I was completely unaware that she thought I was acting rude to her.  Regardless, as a professional DJ my main purpose is to ensure the bride and groom have an evening full of magic and memories and not one full of managing their guests requests which go against what they as the bride and groom envision for their special day.  Most people who are not in the industry or who have never hired a professional DJ do not understand the process behind an event, nor do they necessarily understand why I as a DJ may do certain things during the evening.  But everything I do has been carefully planned out and comes directly from the pre-event discussions I have with the client.  Prior to any wedding or event I am a part of, I have a scheduled meeting to discuss what the couple envisions for their wedding day and ask them questions about the tempo and feel they wish to maintain throughout the cocktail hour and dinner service and the subsequent transition into the more upbeat dancing time which carries on until the end of the evening.  

When meeting with the soon to be bride and groom, they wanted me to play some classic 70s mellower songs Journey, Clapton, Eagles, Kansas etc. and mix in some more current mellow songs by artists like John Mayer, Jack Johnson, Bruno Mars, Buble etc.  So, this is exactly what I did on the day of the wedding.  Genres they wanted me to stay away from entirely were country, Latin, Big Band and anything with obscenities.  They also warned that their intimate group of about 60 guests wasn't much of a dancing group and this indeed proved to be the case.

This leads me to my next point regarding me playing the same song twice throughout the evening.  I obliged to play the same song a second time because the fun group of friends that worked with the bride at Nordstrom's were the only ones at the time dancing and one of the guys came up and asked to hear a song that I had previously played.  I mentioned to him that he already missed the song but he asked if I could play it again so I did.   

Okay, onto this Kitty. K situation and review.....  

I am pretty certain Kitty K. was the girl who came up to me right after dinner saying that the music was ""effin' depressing"" and she wanted it changed.  I told her we were on our way to a transition into faster paced music right after toasts, but regardless, I am extremely disheartened that someone would misconstrue this for being rude and impolite.  She then asked for a specific song which I did not have and she then demanded I play it and I again told her I would be changing up the mood in a few minutes after the plates were cleared and we had finished toasts, but apparently that was not enough for her.  Her cousin (the bride) saw a bit of this exchange and came over and asked me very politely what was going on?  But again, as a professional not wanting to bother the two most important people of the evening with such unnecessary and trivial (or what I thought at the time was trivial) events I just told the bride it was nothing and she was just joking around.  Problem solved..... or so I thought.  :(  

Now, I see this review and I am beyond disheartened by this Kitty K. going to the internet to blast someone and more importantly an established entertainment brand such as AMS Entertainment.  Regardless, everyone is privileged to their freedom of speech and my only wish is that whoever comes across these posts will use fair judgment and realize that their are always two sides to a story.   

I have since spoken with the bride and I know that she didn't feel the same way about the level of support and effort that I went through to ensure she had a truly memorable day.  I have never received a bad review and seeing this one online really left a bad taste in my mouth.  Again, I am not certain what ""bad attitude I carried from the beginning of the day"" that she refers to as that was my one and only interaction with her.

Again, please know that we at AMS strive for perfection and being cordial to all guests.  Thank you for your consideration and for reading this disappointed DJ's rebuttal to a single guest's opinions.  God bless freedom of speech.  ;)",2012-01-27 05:18:45
0w3BG10SxsvDSW7mvaZ22g,lLKlf6jmcCSR_IwcoCsnnw,hfmBNYjc-gEsRckJ5nAsHg,5.0,1,1,0,"First off, LICE AWAY TODAY is run by intelligent, educated, and extremely affable individuals with product and treatment knowledge that--without exaggeration--are second-to-none. If you want clean hair, without lice, come to this establishment. It's as simple, as that. I'm convinced anything less than professional treatment is not only ineffective, but DOES NOT WORK. LICE AWAY TODAY **does** work. Enter their doors frustrated; leave with a smile!

With three daughters under the age of 6, I can state, with certainty, that I did not know what to expect upon walking through the doors of LICE AWAY TODAY. What I did know is that I was UNIQUELY ANNOYED at these white specs invading my daughters' hair. My girls were distraught over the fact that their vacation was being inconvenienced, their heads were infested, and my frustration was building. 

Enter Michelle, the owner of LICE AWAY TODAY, who once again, sans hyperbole, turned what was an otherwise dreaded situation, into--dare I say: an enjoyable experience for my young daughters (and me). I should add that my mother, as well as the girls' nanny were checked. Being bald, I found out for the first time in my life, was a blessing, as I was able to bypass the check-up, as a result of being challenged in the ""hair department"". 

More to the point, like a benevolent leader or commander-in-chief, Michelle warmly greeted my family, put my children at ease with a variety of books, toys, games, and a lovely Labrador Retriever, who in-between naps, kindly showed affection to those that wanted it. While receiving treatment, after it was determined lice was present in each of the girls' hair, my daughters felt great, had built strong ties with each of their technicians (all of whom have wonderful, patient, and gentle dispositions with children), and felt clean, again.

Moreover, Michelle went beyond arranging the checkup and treatment. She educated us, as to the treatment-type, its efficacy, prevention, and the like. Impressively, she explained these topics to both the adults and my children, in a way that was fun, informative, but most importantly, lasting. Make no mistake: Lice outbreaks need professional attention. That said, if you are seeking a fastidiously clean facility, with professional technicians and equipment, and the experience and leadership of an owner that oozes the wonderful spirit of ""life is good"", LICE AWAY TODAY is the place to go. I'm almost tempted to say after spending 3 hours there, I truly missed Michelle and her staff (and this has nothing to do with the pizza that was ordered to keep customers fed, happy, and smiling), by the time we left! 

Thank you, Michelle!",2017-01-05 15:03:04
YJswpKFkBSvRxzIpg_tQbQ,crgWPc35LxjJccLFVQsQig,sm7gu4VNyHjDi-7ufqOBnA,5.0,10,1,4,"I dropped in to a 'Gentle Yoga' class with Rachel Mathenia one evening because I felt like I needed to wake my body up. I used to do yoga three times a week in high school, then I went to college and my habit went to doing yoga a few times a year. It's totally dumb because I love yoga and I always forget what I feel like during yoga and after yoga both physically and emotionally. Why do I wait so long in between!? No excuses!

I don't know a lot about the different types of yoga, but this studio is focused on Inyengar which really is ideal for those with injuries or those who are new to the yoga practice. It focuses on the pose itself and how to maximize it's benefits by getting in to the pose properly and maintaining it properly. It allows for adjustments and the use of props so that you can get the most out of how a pose will benefit your body without pushing too hard and hurting yourself. Rachel's gentle class was true Inyengar. I have to say, her knowledge of the human body and the practice made the class one of the better I've ever taken and I usually am a vinyasa person. I like vinyasa because of the flow and connecting with breath but that may be because I've got a lot of yoga experience under my belt. If you're looking for a class with a LOT of teacher client one on one and talking during class and after, Rachel's gentle class might be the one for you. If you don't mind long gaps in between poses so that you can observe how the next posture should be done properly, this class might be for you. I really needed to slow my brain down and focusing on even the most subtle changes in a posture allowed my my mind to reconnect with my body, something I value very highly. I personally feel like you can benefit from taking Inyengar and Vinyasa simultaneously, especially if you are a seasoned yoga person but not a hard core yogi. It's good to revisit basic postures and really explore how they are all meant to be done. Your body will make a memory and when you're in another more fast paced or advanced class it will call on those memories, or at least that's my experience. If you're new to yoga I suggest an Inyengar class and then experimentation with other yoga classes once your body becomes familiar yoga. That's just my opinion, you never know until you try! 

The studio has it's own parking lot on 12th which is great because we all know how annoying it is to park down there. It's cozy and they provide props and mats at no cost. The drop in fee is $20, so it's definitely a good idea to consider buying classes in bulk. I'm still exploring my yoga options in Nashville but I definitely liked Rachel's energy, sense of humor, and patience. I would highly recommend her classes.",2014-01-15 19:01:01
FH0MMAQOGw6i-eTg-ZOBQg,04tToZxhKNgFmn731IzAyQ,Bi6VtAzrGRMMyKQ1O5vasA,5.0,3,0,0,"We have been in Tucson for only one month.  We have had 5 dogs over 17 years and currently have  three senior Chihuahuas who are our entire life.  We are not trusting of most professionals by nature, and certainly experience (e.g., see my other veterinary reviews on Yelp), so I do not give good reviews easily, nor bad one's if not well deserved. 

  We were referred to Ina Road Animal Hospital by another veterinarian in the area who could not see us.  Our Milo Shamus was seen by Dr. Brenda Reed.  We were totally impressed and feel extremely fortunate to have found her.  Dr. Reed knows public relations and is skilled in communicating with anxious people who love their dogs as much as we do.  She was honest with her diagnostic findings and offered us options.  Beyond Dr. Reed, from the time we arrived we were impressed, from the individual on the phone to the efficiency and communication skill of  the tech who came out to gather Milo's intake information and her gentle handling of him as she took him in.  We wish we had noted her name so we could thank her personally. 

As a retired RN, I know first hand the stress of dealing with the public.  When anxiety, fear, money concerns, and dependence on the expertise, honesty, and knowledge of others enters the picture, it can be a real nightmare.  Veterinarians often suffer from those conditions, as well as trying to treat beings who can not tell them how they feel, or what they need.

So, please consider that each veterinarian spends at least 10 years of their life earning a DVM degree, which they also have to pay for. Veterinary practices often have more than one veterinarian on staff, including surgeons and pharmacists. So you can easily have upward of 100 years of professional, science based, specialized college education that cost millions of dollars, in a single veterinary practice.   They are also paying wages and insuring themselves, their large staffs, in addition to paying rent (or mortgages) on the space where they practice. They also have to pay for and maintain diagnostic equipment like  x-ray machines, ultra-sound equipment, lab equipment, as well as outside laboratory services, medical supplies, and drugs they dispense, to name only a few overhead costs.  

So, we were happy beyond belief that the total bill for helping our Milo Shamus, which included prescription medications and x-rays, as well as the time and expert knowledge of Dr. Reed and her staff, was only $300.   That has to be the best deal of the century!!  Thank you Dr. Reed and the staff of Ina Road Veterinary Hospital!",2021-03-08 18:07:58
IUXPHOFXfiCUEjNB1gL3UQ,W6P5aRhimkW3Z15I5G_Erw,A8eWhMmvWbAiuTZ3OtF_xA,5.0,5,5,1,"I had to take a look at Pizza Squared after I set upon a quest to find the perfect pizza in Tampa Bay. My objective was straightforward: I wanted a medium-thickness crust and a sweet, consistent sauce (not chunky). Seems simple, doesn't it? Well, nowadays, it seems everyone wants to claim that they are ""New York-style"" or ""Chicago-style."" As someone who had none of these styles growing up in my hometown (I didn't even know people actually put sauce _on top_ until I came to Tampa), I was desperate to find a pizza that reminded me of home - and wasn't sold by ""Pizza Hut"" or ""Dominos.""

A Yelp Talk thread pointed me to Pizza Squared. I would normally have filed the idea under ""I'll try that sometime, thanks,"" due to its proximity to USF and my location in Westshore. But one thing sold me - the Yelp picture. It looked like a 'slice' of home, minus the sauce and cheese's role reversal. So, I decided at that moment that I would brave life, limb, and property to take the drive on a Tuesday rush hour up I-275 to Pizza Squared to have some of what was in that picture.

I placed my order after passing one of the four crashes on 275 along my journey - an '8-square' cheese, Detroit style (like you see in the picture). According to their menu, they have New York style as well, so you can give that a shot if for some reason there isn't a New York Style pizzeria within a 1/8th mile radius from you. I'm sure it's good, but I'm too New Yorked out to try. On any other day, I would have gotten pepperoni, but for some reason, we had a vegetarian at our house and I decided to be nice. Turns out she didn't have any pizza anyway since she had already eaten carrots or something. Whatever, her loss.

I finally arrived at Pizza Squared at just the right time, as the pizza had just came out of their oven. There is nothing better than hot, fresh pizza right from an oven from the moment it touches your lips until the moment the first layer of skin begins to peel from the roof of your mouth minutes later. Unfortunately I had a 20+ minute drive back to Westshore and 2 car accidents to drive through, so I was worried I wouldn't get the full Pizza Squared experience. Fortunately, this is Tampa, home of the world's longest red lights, and I was about to take Busch Boulevard to get back on 275, so I got plenty of opportunities to take numerous bites of the fresh pizza before I got home.

In case you're wondering: the pizza looks just like the picture, which thrilled me, as it reminded me of one of my favorite pizza parlors back home. Heck, 5 hours later, my burps still taste like the burps after eating from that back-home joint. It's truly a wonderful thing. Even the cheese is phenomenal, and that baked-into-crust style is fantastic.

If I had to change (or customize) anything, I would forgo the whole 'sauce-on-top' functionality. I'm sure it wouldn't then be called 'Detroit-style,' but I guess that's just what I've always called ""pizza."" Sauce on top isn't bad - and their sauce is certainly great - but I like sauce in every bite. When it's on top, I only get sauce in those glorious bites that are directly graced by Pizza Squared's sweet sauce.

I've also seen some pizza joints offer half-baked pizza for bringing home, freezing, and cooking on your own time. If Pizza Squared offered this, I'd likely buy whatever I could fit in my freezer. I'd probably even throw out the years-old boxes of frozen vegetables to make even more room so I could enjoy Pizza Squared without a nearly hourlong round trip.

All in all, my favorite Bay area pizza joint thus far. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is sick of the me-too New York and Chicago style pizzerias that are more common than a ""Coming Soon: Chase Bank"" sign on a Tampa roadway.

PROS:
- Perfect crust, not too thick, not too thin.
- Caramelized cheese in the crust.
- Pizza boxes that don't say ""World's Greatest Pizza.""
- Stoplights on Busch Boulevard.

CONS:
- Sauce isn't in every single bite.
- No half-baked option (yet!).
- Detroit.
- Chase bank.

SCORE: 5/5. Definitely try if you're all New Yorked out.",2012-06-27 04:50:12

I think if they didn't have it, it wouldn't be worth coming here & waiting the entire time. So definitely use the yelp app to add your name on the waitlist!! If you have a party of 6 or less, you have the option to put your name on the list. However, if your party is 7 or more, you have to go see the host and put your name on the list.

The waitlist is live so you can check on the yelp app how many more parties are ahead of you. If you have 7+ more people in your party, you can try calling them and putting your name on the list or the host told me you can choose 6 people in your party & then in the notes, say the actual amount of people in the party. When you get to the restaurant, checkin with the host and have the host update the correct party size. I wish I knew that beforehand!! We sent our lovely brother in law to hurry there and put our names on the list. So definitely do that so you don't have to waste your time walking there & physically putting your name on the list. Also, make sure to get there a little early so you're there when your table is ready. There were 2 groups that kept getting called & no one was there so they gave the table away. Also, if you're no longer going to go there, take your name off the list! 

Food: we ordered SO many meals... there was 7 of us and we all got one drink & we ordered 9 entrees.. it was almost $250!! Super expensive. However, the food was AMAZING! One of us got the trifecta (3 Benedict's) and the chicken st Charles (fried chicken) Benedict was everyone's favorite Benedict. We also liked the eggs cohon Benedict and stuffed French toast. The BLT was really good. The pancake flight (mix of 3 pancakes) was alright... not that good. Our favorite meal though was the banana foster!!! SO good! Omg. Drooling just thinking about it. It was super sweet though so I suggest getting one to share with the table... it might be a little too sweet as a whole entree for one person. Vegetarian wise, you can order something without meat. I got a Benedict without meat & just added avocado. Boring but it was still good :) Make sure to order ASAP. We ordered around 12-12:30 and the Benedict special was sold out already and one of our guys in our group got the last one!!! So since you're waiting for a long time, I recommend you figure out what you want to eat & order ASAP after sitting down. The food also takes awhile to come out so it's nice to order sooner rather than later. 

Service: I think you might be able to split bills which is nice. The waiters have tablets and they select what each person/chair wants. I hate when you go to a popular restaurant & the staff sucks... not the case here!! Everyone was so friendly!!! The waiters and waitresses work hard & are all so nice. The hostess was so friendly too! I'm sure they get bombarded with people repeatedly checking in/getting updates on the wait, etc but she was so friendly!!! It was such a delight to have such friendly staff! 

Overall, we really liked our meals here. I'd definitely recommend going & putting your name on the waitlist. Do not miss out on coming here!! Especially when the restaurant has a chain of them, you suspect the meals won't be as good... not the case here! Everything was amazing & super filling!!",2018-10-11 20:37:58

We only spoke with Melissa leading up to the wedding. I found each time I spoke to her things would have to be repeated because she would forget what was spoken about previously. Nothing was written down or notated which was very evident on the day which was CHAOS. They thought we had a coordinater despite all communication coming from me and me sending them a vendor list with all the other vendors contact details on? Melissa was not there and Mark kept coming up to me to ask questions about timings/preferences. Our lifesaving photographer had to act as a go between and relay messages to the team so I could actually sit down and enjoy the meal! The ""professional"" bartender we hired out through them at $50 an hour made several mistakes including leaving our alcohol outside after ""cocktail hour"" and moving it into a storage room without telling anyone so half of it was missing, we ran dry and it put a dampener on the day. Lucca to their credit refunded us the money we spent on the bartender. 
The food itself was very disappointing. The charcuterie was small and there wasn't really enough to go around. Melissa also offered to provide GF crackers for the charcuterie so I could eat it too but when I asked Mark on the day none were provided for me. The pizzas were bland and had no real toppings on for example someone couldn't eat cheese and got a pizza with onions and basil - no meat or veg. Just bread and sauce. I'm gluten free and my pizzas constantly came out cheese-less and plain? The salad was meant to come with tomato but it was just a plain leaf salad with cheese. Again we had discussed having it cheese-less for vegans/lactose intolerant people but this also wasn't done. We had planned to serve the homemade gelato desert (which turns out was store bought) with our wedding cake however they tried to serve up before people had finished their pizza or before the cake cutting (we had run off time). They plated it up and all we could do is put it in the freezer where it partially melted. They left before desert and we then served ourselves!

I had a almost perfect wedding day my only regret is I wish I chose one of the wonderful professional caterers I had spoken to rather than Lucca!",2019-06-09 11:45:55

I do not see myself coming here often because it is on the more expensive side, but it is a must-try if you have never been or need a sweet spot to go to. The ambience here definitely gives off a romantic vibe with a fresh red rose at each table. The inside seating is dimly lit surrounded by red walls which is nice but the outside seating is super gorgeous and well lit. My party and I were going to sit outside but realized it is too cold so that is something I recommend when the weather gets warmer. 

The service here was on point. We were greeted immediately and taken to our table. Then our server introduced herself to us and brought us water a few moments after we sat down. As our night went a long, our waitress did a great job at answering our questions and checking up on us.

I wanted to try out the drinks because there were chocolate in them so I ordered the dark sexual. If you like strong, alcoholic, and spicy drinks, this one is for you. I expected the drink to be sweeter but it wasn't too bad, I tasted some hints of chocolate and spice at the end. It was interesting but not necessarily delicious. Then we ordered a cheese plate to start off with. The three cheeses we chose were: gjetost, port salut, and maple smoked white cheddar. All of these were so satisfying. I did not know what gjetost was initially but it has a sweet taste to it that reminded me of caramel. According to our server, it is goat cheese. The port salut was creamy just the way I like it and the cheddar was definitely smoky. The presentation was cute and was accompanied by toast, spicy assorted nuts, and dried berries. 

Then, we tried the grand cru chocolate fondue. This is where I had to knock a star  off of the rating, I expected the chocolate fondue to be on some sort of heat source but it came out already melted in a mug plated with the dipping accompaniments. I like my chocolate to stay warm or hot the entire time, so it got cold and thick within a few minutes in the mug. It would have been fine if it was not called a fondue then I would not have that sort of expectation. 

Overall, I did have a good experience here and I see myself coming back quite often to try everything else on the menu.",2016-03-08 12:10:12
XzehQ-OM8H86dPswEDEZ9g,oYn4yU4hI8w9vMQkR9bx1w,lN_9tSK-zUZyCAkVykKfoA,2.0,2,0,0,"My star count is lowered due to my ticket experience - not my visit.  Club is very nice, people are nice and they love to have people enjoying themselves.  Back in January 2013, I bought tickets for a little known comic (Jim Jefferies) who is my favorite comic ever - has been for years.  So I buy a ticket from Side Splitters website, tickets are handled by vendor TicketBiscuit.  I paid over 130 dollars for premium tickets on a table for four, two tables away from the stage.  A few months later, Jim Jefferie's show LEGIT started on FX.  He is now a star.  Fast forward to April 19th, showtime.

Our party of 4 got babysitters for our kids, went to dinner at Outback nearby, and wandered in to Side Splitters at 930pm.  Seating starts at 945pm.  The nice lady at the ticket taker desk motioned for the owner to come over - as there is an issue:  apparently, they double sold the entire club, leaving anyone who purchased tickets prior to March, screwed.  They sold the very seats  paid $130 for to other people.  Wait - but I have a printed confirmation....and my ticket number shows up in your computer for tonight's show.  Didn't matter - they chose to penalize those who bought early - before Mr. Jefferies was a star....people like me and my party of four.

The owner bought us drinks at the bar and said he is working on it - as the doors to the club start to close I move up to the doors preventing them from shutting - no way am I not getting in.  The owner, always polite and apologetic, explained that Mr. Jefferie's PR firm had canceled his show that night, and booked him in Miami.  Miami apparently did not work out, and then re-booked him back at Side Splitters. Problem is, TicketBiscuit re-opened ticket sales for the same night - even thought the club was fully sold out.  HMMMmmmm....who to blame?  

Side Splitters...?  TicketBiscuit...?  Jim Jefferies...?  Jim doesn't schedule himself or deal with ticketing - so he's out.  I blame all other parties.  We were told that all ticket holders were notified of the cancellation.  I wasn't.  Even though all of my information was needed to buy the ticket - my email address, phone number, address.  No attempt by Side Splitters are TicketBiscuit was made.  

In the end, some people never showed up, and we got their sloppy second seats - the other two people in our party were separated from us and sent to other seats on the far side of the room.  We were given two more round of free drinks and were able to watch the show.  Seats were okay - but not two tables away like I purchased.  I consider it too much trouble to try and recoup my losses as I did get to see my comic, I got free drinks, and we had fun.

Somebody involved knows who's fault it is - and you should be ashamed - hopefully this will happen to them one day.  Yes, its a comedy show.... #FirstWorldProblems....but I want what I paid for - that's fair........right?

Tl;dr - Surf and Turf Po'boy was not great, but the fried shrimp one was great. Poutine fries didn't live up to the hype, pricey and totally skip-able. Order in the back and seat yourself, if you want full service, sit in the front of the house bar area.

Known for the best Po'boys in New Orleans, we set out relatively early to visit before going to City Park. We arrived a few minutes before opening, and soon, there were two different crowds at the door waiting with us. As soon as the door opened, everyone piled in and began lining up to order at the back of the house.

We tried both the surf and turf Po'boy, as well as the fried shrimp, and also got a order of fries with gravy. The kitchen was already set up, and I'm guessing the crowds are not new to them, so the orders were out pretty quick. They also have their own sauce bar, so as you're waiting for your name to be called you could help yourself to the variety of sauces they offered.

We got the orders, and found a place to sit down, and dug in. 

Surf and turf Po'boy- I had high hopes and I was expecting something spectacular, and unfortunately, it wasn't my favorite Po'boy of the week. The gravy made the fried shrimp not really crispy. Overall, the flavors didn't really go well and the construction of the sandwich was not great. Everything, and I really do mean everything was just falling out of the sandwich and wrapper, it was so incredibly hard to eat. The bread got a bit soggy from the gravy, and it was just a tad disastrous. 

Fried Shrimp Po'boy- The boyfriend ordered this, and I have to say I'm jealous I didn't pick this one instead. The shrimp was delicious! It was lightly dressed with some mayo, and the bread was great! He ordered the large, and barely managed to finish, portions of the shrimp was large and overall tasty.

Poutine Fries-  Honestly, I think it was a bit pricy for what it was. The individual toppings cost a tad too much, $1 extra for gravy and another $1 extra for cheese, and the fries end up being $7, which is a price of a small lunch. Not very worth it in my opinion. And at the end of the day, I didn't really think they were all that spectacular, and I probably wouldn't try again. 

If I ever come back, I will probably never get the surf and turf again, and will definitely opt to try something else.",2017-01-22 17:14:45
QrX-c7fmTBMxDATYTo_uyA,Qpddd2y-_LwCpHRvqfZRzw,4gvAsj8NRTla82aSBzGytw,3.0,4,2,3,"Nothing ground breaking here, this was my first experience with a SPOS steak.  It's a good Philly style steak, that comes at a reasonable price.  It's not as Hollywood as some other steak joints in the city.  It's just off of Roosevelt blvd, and it's a fairly easy in and out.  The building also has a tavern attached to it, which I didn't have time to check out.  I arrived around 5:00 on a Friday and the bar was pretty busy and parking was at a premium.  I walked into the take out area of Steve's and there were a few people in line to order, but not a long wait whatsoever.  The service was super friendly.  I ordered the standard: a whiz wit.  Translation for the non-Philadelphians:  a cheese steak on a roll with cheese whiz and fried onions.  The take out area was clean, with about a dozen stools seated around a stainless steel bar.  I choose to get my steak to eat in.  My streak was prepared to my liking in about 5 minutes.  It wasn't as fast as other places, where you order and they throw it out the window to you.   I don't worry about that because I didn't have to wait in a huge line.  I did appreciate the very well stocked condiment bar that included: hot sauce, ketchup, mustard, sliced pickles (which were almost half sours in my opinion and very good), sliced banana peppers, whole cherry pepper and my absolute favorite on a cheese steak, the cockroach pepper.  The cockroach peppers are dried chili peppers that have such good flavor.  I tend to always put too many on my steak, they are hot, but I love the smokey heat addition to my sandwich.  The steak meat was sliced not chopped.  It was served with a very gracious amount of delicious diced fried onions.  There was enough cheese whiz on it to account for four napkins.  The roll was fresh and Philly quality.  Overall the steak was great.  4 out of 5, five being the best steak I've ever had.  If the meat was chopped and there was. more of it, I'd give a 5.  The chopped meat is just my personal preference.  The meat itself was a quality ribeye.  There was no knuckle meat here, it was all tender. The quantity of meat was OK, I prefer more, but for the price, I'd say it is just fine.  

The counter man was friendly and kind.  He was polite, thanked everyone and kept the steaks rolling out.  Some steak joints have rude and miserable workers, but not here.  You will not be sent to the back of the line for an improper order at SPOS.

So here we are at the conclusion and I've said it was a 4 star experience.  That was until I got my cherry soda.  All the good steak shops in Philly serve the iconic cherry fountain soda.  My cherry fountain soda for the first couple sips tasted great.  The soda I love is a semi sweet tart cherry soda that I can usually only find at the steak shops.  After about four sips I tasted something familiar to me, just not very pleasing.  I believe it was the ice.  The ice tasted like the chlorinated pool water at the Bethlehem YMCA.  I was taken back to thoughts of swimming lesson at the YMCA when I was 6 and 7 years old.  It was unpleasant and not good.  I couldn't finish my soda, that I very much was looking forward to.  I don't know if they just cleaned the ice machine and didn't rinse it or if it needs to be cleaned.  In any event, my soda was undrinkable.

In conclusion, great service, really good steak.  If you are drinking a fountain soda, beware, you make be drinking pool water.",2018-01-30 14:14:37
QKVPAVdGE30JBitCB9fDNg,TrU49Ydk2ZMjlh0rtOVj7g,cQIh4YJlVtZI9TLF5_smOg,5.0,22,14,18,"As seen on DDD. This is the real deal for St. Louis soul cuisine and should be on your short list if out of town. Awesome vibe and service.

The location of the business, okay...don't worry, be happy. It's not bad, but the surrounding residential neighborhood's appearance is aged. Don't let the rough hood deter you. During the day I would have no issue of returning. But with being out of town and not knowing the area at night not so sure. Parking is by street. 

The cool old two story building added to our anticipation of opening the faded antique wooden doors in the front. A couple of tables are in front and a few more picnic tables on the right. The front entry way was clear of debris. 

Our party was immediately greeted by a hostess on a weekday around 1145 AM. A bar is up front with tables, chairs and a few booths in the rear. Wood floors, exposed brick and beautiful woodwork. Also nice artwork hanging on the walls. 

A male waiter was Johnny on the spot getting drink orders. I was with two children in their early teens that were very skeptical of soul food. Menus were placed on the table and shortly after waters out. 

Our party needed recommendations, especially the kids. Our waiter was a rock star and provided lots of ideas for the kids, mixing things up, asking questions and being very patient. It was a bit embarrassing how long it took, but the server never flinched. 

My order was a Combination Plate / burnt ends on a slice of bread, tri-tip, ribs, brisket & caramelized onion mash. Side of in-house BBQ sauce. Kicked it off with their classic appetizer smothered fries. 

The verdict. The burnt ends and brisket were home runs, the mash was off for me. Be brave if you go solo on the smothered fries. The others in my party enjoyed their dishes as well. The kids dishes worked and they enjoyed. 

The price point for lunch pushes to a high range. At the same time the quality and preparation of all the dishes made me feel at though it was worth every penny. Our waiter checked in multiple times and when time for a check was efficient. By this time there was a wait out the door. I've been told at peak service it can be over an hour. 

Loved the atmosphere, loved the food and the service was phenomenal. An extra star does go to our waiter. Unfortunately I failed to get his name to recognize in this review darn it. Would love to return and recommend.

dKhzf-6sf_P3zY8zhYYc5A,BSwdigoJugbFKFBoocJorQ,4VaDEdlN33O2zXeYEs-8Zw,1.0,3,0,1,"I rarely give 1 star reviews (mostly because I frequently seek Yelp's advice and avoid places that have such low ratings, oops), but this place had me irritated.  I've been here for car washes in the past, this place is going downhill- while the price is going uphill.  Seriously if you're raising your prices, maintain your business!  

So I drove up and asked for the middle priced car wash because the it came with some Armorall wipes so I could clean the inside of the car too.  So then they guys says they don't have any Armorall (though that's what the sign said), and offered me one of those little tree car scent things.  I also noticed while I was paying that they had signs all over saying that they no longer accept their stamp/punch cards.  Really?  How grumpy would I be if I had one of those almost full and they told me ""tough luck!"".  And who decides to stop offering an option that ensures customer loyalty!  Sounds like they don't want to give out anything free, even to the loyal.   Seemed scrimpy.  

So we went through the car wash- that was fair.  They installed those red and blue lights that make the soap look like lava and such, which my kids enjoyed.  The wash seemed a little rough, the washers kept knocking my side-view mirrors back and forth.  I wouldn't take a car with a fancy paint job here!  Luckily I have so many dings and such that I wouldn't notice if it did any bonus damage.  

Alright- car is washed... on to the vacuums (really the reason I came here- the inside needed help just as much as the outside).  First, not all the vacuums worked, so you had to be creative to get the one that worked to reach all spots of the car without pulling out and re-parking.  Second- the part that made me almost lose my mind with irritation- the vacuum turns off every minute- literally only 60 seconds.  So just as soon as you climb into that back seat and do gymnastics to get those kid-crumbs, it shuts off... Shimmy back out of the car, push the button to turn it back on, and climb back in as fast as possible to maximize the brief time it stays on before you have to get out again.  ARGHH. 

Then- there's like 1 trash can available, across the parking lot from where I was.  OK, maybe they are trying to be frugal about everything else, but spare a few extra trash cans?  The place was littered with junk that other people left on the cement blocks, obviously as irritated as I was (but alas, I did make the trek to the trash can with my handfuls of bits of this and that).  They used to have racks of wet rags you could use to wipe things down.  This time, there was one rack of nearly dry rags, also way over by the trash can.  And when I used them to wipe down the inside of my windows, it left my windows with a residue of funk.  

So my overall opinion- what used to be a good place has turned into a penny-pinching, poorly maintained place that is run by someone who doesn't care about customer satisfaction.  Won't be back, I suppose I'll make the the drive all the way down to that fantastic car wash down by rattlesnake mountain (Longley and McCarran), rather than come back here.",2016-02-16 08:36:49

I want to give you a fair review, but I haven't been able to interact with anyone from the actual passport center in New Orleans. We are coming up on 72 hours to international travel, and there's no way to get a status on my daughter's passports, including a phone call from the agency. I am willing to pay additional expedite costs for the two passports, including from a 3rd party, but I am stuck since you are holding the documents and not processing.

Additionally, I can't get a straight answer on if traveling in the next 24 hours to New Orleans to try and procure the passports in person as a last-ditch effort is even a viable option. It is not cheap or convenient to travel 3500 miles round trip a day before your international family vacation starts, and there's no way of knowing if the inconvenient attempt, significant cost, and repercussions from the unexpected time off work will get me anywhere.

The New Orleans agency has had the necessary ID / Citizenship documents for six-plus weeks. We submitted a request to expedite a week ago, which is still pending approval. The only reason we waited was that the passport representatives along the way kept assuring us that everything should be on track. The estimated process time when ordered was 4-6 weeks when the order was submitted. They don't tell you that it can take a week or two after they receive before they enter in the system and that is when the clock starts. The estimated timeframe they quote can change at any moment. Don't believe anyone throughout the process that says an expedite is not required no matter your time to travel since the people saying that have no idea as they don't work for the actual agency. The agency employees don't seem to factor in travel dates as they claim and their call center representatives don't give a sense that they have any comprehension of the impact this has on people and their families.

It is obvious the Travel - State Department is outsourcing their customer service to an incompetent vendor with antiquated technology and poor processes including the inability to forecast and staff accordingly. The minimum wait time to speak to an agent is 30 min, and then some agents will hang up on you immediately, which happened to me this morning with an agent name Teresa. This method is an old technique for agents to boost their call time stats. I had another agent tell earlier today that her expected handle time call time is 5 min, and she was going to need to hang up, which she did when I was in the middle of asking a question. The agents have no visibility to order process status, each agent you speak with gives you different answers and information, and they are clearly instructed and incentivized to get you off the line ASAP. 

I need to know if there is any way to approve the pending expedite request and overnight the passports ASAP? Again, I will pay for the shipping and any additional expedite costs.

If not and I have to travel to New Orleans and show up in person, do I need an appt, will you process on-site and release the passports to me as the father since you already have the documents?  

Please assist!",2019-06-04 20:02:02

I had high hopes for this new sushi restaurant after stalking them for a while on Yelp.  I take my sushi outings very seriously these days because they don't happen too often anymore.  I even posted a talk segment in 'Talks' but no reply from anyone.  Sad.

Anyways, me and my girlfriend went today (Sat Oct 31 2020) about noon.  We were going to go last night, then we didn't, then we talked about going today, then we changed our mind, then we said ""Bah, let's just go"" and decided to go today.  I was hesitant going on a Saturday, thinking we're getting all the old stuff from the week or they'd be out of things.  All this was running through my head prior.

To my surprise, yep, they're out of things alright!  We ordered some nigiri and some appetizers to start: the nachos and scallops.  The scallops were not great, just a few small ones in a puddle of melted butter, nothing fancy.  They kind of turned me off from ordering anything with scallops going forward.  The nachos: very tasty and super fried seaweed crunchy chips, yum.

My GF ordered the Puff Puff Pass hand roll and it came in seaweed, the menu said soy wrap paper.  Come to find out they were all out of the pink soy wrap sheets.  Aren't there a ton of Asian marts around where one of the employees can quickly go grab some?  I've never had them before and was excited to try a few rolls that listed them as the ingredients.  

Also, a huge reason I wanted to try Biggest Little sushi is because of the Sea Bass on the nigiri menu.  They had none!!  I was so bummed.  After a few bites in, I kind of wanted to leave and come back another day when they had stuff.

There was only one waitress taking orders and we were the only ones in there.  The other two tables were on dessert and wrapping up.  She was definitely loopy or high.  We wanted more wasabi and she brought us a bowl of pink pickled ginger then laughed about it hysterically.  I mean, she was super nice about it but it seems she doesn't know the difference between the two.  She finally brought us wasabi after we were all done eating.

Every time I ordered something from the menu, a hand roll, a roll, nigiri, whatever, she would go put the order in with the two VERY young Hispanic men behind the bar and they would all look over at us and whisper.  Like I was bothering them by ordering more.  To be honest, I ate the least amount of sushi I ever have because I felt like I was putting them out by having them make more items.  I thought it was all you can eat...and I eat a lot. 

Come to think of it, other places will give you a little cucumber salad when you sit down and make you feel welcome.  Our waitress said ""it's been a long day"" and it was only 12:30, they opened at 11:00.  I don't know, I felt rushed and very much judged by ordering AYCE sushi.  The waitress took forever and the guy chefs were barely at the counter.  They were all hanging out in the back most of the time. 

I will say the escolar (super white tuna) and the snapper or Mackerel, whichever they gave me, was very fresh and melt in your mouth good.  They do use very fresh fish and minimal rice which I really like.  I didn't feel stuffed from filler rice and everything seemed accurate, except for the Puff Puff Pass hand roll.

That's about all I have to say about the Biggest Little Sushi.  Next time, I will try Hinoki again since it's been a few years.",2020-11-02 19:20:43

I can't believe it's taken me this long to review Milagro. Atmosphere, food, service - this place is five-star all the way. The rave reviews here on Yelp are why we decided to host International Supper Club here and why I've gone back a few times since.

The experience starts on the Milagro website. It's easy on the eyes via both a monitor and a smartphone, and it gives me the info I need quickly and without a crap-ton of words and images. Non-PDF menu? HELLS YES, and danke! Bonus: owner Adam uses Facebook and Twitter to promote Milagro the way social media was intended - as conversation starters and food pic sharing devices. It all works together, folks!

Getting to the restaurant can be a little tricky the first time. It's in the back corner of a business plaza in Webster Groves. You can park anywhere (sometimes the little lot right in front of Milagro's door is full, but there are plenty of other spots around) and just walk a couple hundred feet. If you're coming from the main street, Milagro is in the back-right corner of that one square building - that's as best as I can describe it, sorry! There's not a lot of signage to guide you, so keep your eyes peeled.

Once you arrive, you'll be smacked upside the head with all sorts of yummy smells, which is much better than being smacked upside the head with gross cigarette smoke (Thanks for not having THAT, Milagro!). Milagro has a lovely bar area that's cozy and sort of dreamy for a quick meetup or date. Personally, I bypass the bar and head straight for a booth. I hate to use the word ""cozy"" twice in the same review - twice in the same paragraph, even! - but that's what the booths are. There's room to spread out a little so that your ass cheek isn't on top of someone's thigh, but the wooden, cushioned booths have high backs and make you feel like you're shielded from the world.

Good thing you've got that shield going, because you don't want people to see your food and get ideas about stealing it! This isn't weird ""You're so loco, Pepe"" fake Mexican food we're talking about - this is the real deal. You can see the care that Adam and company have in presenting authentic Mexican nomnoms for your tastebuds. I've made a huge feast out of appetizers, sides and entrees during all of my visits, and I have yet to taste a bad item. 

Let me save you the time and tell you what to get during your first visit (I'm vegetarian): queso fundido (we got the sausage on the side), street corn off the cob, black beans. Everything else is yummy too, but you CANNOT leave without eating the street corn!

The best part about dining at Milagro, though, is the service. Each time I've been there, owner Adam has been wandering around, asking sincerely if the food was tasty, sharing top-secret ideas that his team is trying out, doling out samples of new noms and drinks, and genuinely making sure that we leave happy and satisfied. Doesn't matter if you're with two people or 20, the Milagro staff has you covered. I absolutely wouldn't hesitate to bring someone I'm trying to impress - parents, colleagues, my already-smitten boyfriend - here.",2011-02-03 21:00:00
zG6cOFltnng67ZrkLAS2MA,Qe8k3cW2HzLPbt-A2U-jXA,kDzWs4ed9zOJ6a8xfCrBtg,1.0,1,0,0,"This restaurant needs new management and workers. I went in yesterday after work to grab a drink with my BF we sat at the bar for 10 minutes without even a hello I'll be right with you so I decided maybe I should give the bartender a break so I stayed another 5 minutes but then I saw the bartender go over to a elderly couple at the bar and ask them if they would like to order anything else without ever asking us what we would like or even a simple hello would've sufficed. I left without service & a very bad taste in my mouth simply because I know I am not invisible I saw the bartender glance at us and continue putting away glassware. This visit took place on 4/20 at around 6:15p.m. with only 4 other patrons at the bar. I've worked service jobs before and the way the bartender and bar back completely ignored us was unacceptable. I can't help but to think the only reason to ignore us was because of the color of our skin but that should never be the case because you never know who someone is or what they do for a living never judge someone by their looks. Also the host was very friendly I'll give them that. But everything else is trash & I have a friend who worked in the kitchen for 2 weeks but decided to quit because of how they were treated being one of the only people of color in the kitchen. BTW the kitchen is absolutely disgusting they barely change the oil trying to conserve money and they only reason I go there is for the drinks but they will never get a dime from me again. This isn't even the first time I've encountered this kind of treatment I went on a Friday night when a young Caucasian female was bar tending and she was rude as ever and she was very lucky I was in good spirits that day but we will leave that alone. Other than that I have one tip for this establishment if you plan to continue business in Trenton, NJ you can't show your racism so blatantly when 86% of this population is African American. But all the best maybe one day someone will sue this place again so management can change all I can do I hope!!!",2021-04-21 15:04:59

The first time we visited this restaurant was admittedly on a day after a holiday when the restaurant had not been open very long. The service was awful. The time for the food orders to be delivered was awful. The entire experience was a total fail. But the restaurant was reasonably still in new opening mode. So I gave them a pass and several years before giving the another try today.

The service was good. 

The restaurant offers a nice atmosphere. It is really not very big and it seems the design of the place is very good for ambiance, noise, etc. 
HOWEVER, we arrived after the lunch rush. So the restaurant was not busy. Our party was 3: my 19-year old daughter, myself, and my 87-year old mother. 3 generations.
We were seated in a booth facing the bar. It would have been okay except there were some spirited customers sitting at the bar who were a bit loud. 
So fail for seating location. I understand that hostesses are taught to seat according to server stations. Well um, hostesses should also be trained to maybe evaluate the party they are seating. Maybe even ask if the party minds being seated in the bar? 
Seriously. The restaurant itself is awesome and has a lot of window seating, etc. Seating guests for the convenience of the wait-staff is kinda poor. It certainly reduced the tip. Not the fault of the very fine server. 

Food:  So I suggested Ruby Tuesday because I was in the mood for a light lunch (think: salad bar) and we had not been to RT for YEARS. 
So when we entered and passed by the salad bar enroute to our booth table in the bar, my intention for salad bar lunch pretty much dissipated. I'm not sure what has happened. I always thought RT to have a reputation for a great salad bar. Um yeah. Maybe my standards have changed to be more discriminating. I don't know. But seriously, if you are contemplating visiting this Ruby Tuesday for the salad bar: think again. There are a lot of restaurants with great salad bars. This is not one of them.

The food: I'm sorry, The menu is overpriced, in my opinion. The salad bar is quite a joke for the $. The food was mediocre at best. I ordered a mixed appetizer for my entree. My daughter ordered a cheeseburger. My mom ordered something else. We all left quite a bit on our plates and didn't take the leftovers. 

Sorry, Ruby Tuesday. The service was fine. The restaurant and food was pretty bad. This was the second bad experience we've had at this restaurant out of two visits spaced years apart. 

Perhaps the most amazing thing is the menu prices.",2018-11-23 03:25:33
klphTc9HPz0D2PD4K9gVBg,gfWTee4CnQF-shBgAsvI9g,8TsrQgwDu3pKFUjvajxkJQ,4.0,3,2,1,"I'm not generally a fan of sports bars since I'm fully capable on my own of preparing the sort of food you get at such places. I'm also fully capable of purchasing and pouring my favorite beer into a pint glass. Usually both of these can be done for significantly less cost than going to a sports bar. By doing my best to avoid sports bars I can save money and actually go see a game in person.

But every once in a while, it's fun to gather with a bunch of people to watch a game that you might not get on TV at home or going to watch a special event. Winner's Circle in Exton is just the kind of place to do such a thing.

What separates Winner's Circle from most sports bars is the menu. It is creative and well-executed. For snacking, you can't go wrong with the nachos or wings; typical sports bar fare but Winner's Circle does them very well. Moving on, Winner's Circle has an eclectic variety of sandwiches that change from time to time, many of them having names inspired by Philadelphia sports lore. My favorite was named ""The Freak"" after Jevon Kearse, who turned out to be a huge failure in Philly. The sandwich, however, was a total success: a combination of grilled sausage, hamburger patties, and pulled pork on a hoagie roll with tomato, lettuce, hot peppers, etc. Unfortunately they didn't have it on the menu last time I visited. The personal pizzas are surprisingly good-- I found the Steak and Portabella pie to be thoroughly enjoyable. The selection of entrees offers items such as salmon, fajitas, or chicken pot pie for the more sophisticated palate (or maybe just to keep the women happy). I have to say the meat loaf is pretty damn tasty.

As far as liquid sustenance is concerned, Winner's Circle offers a pretty impressive array of brews. From Bud Light to Chimay (you don't see that at many sports bars), everyone should be able to get a beer of their liking.

Yes, the decor is unabashedly sports bar kitsch--way too much memorabilia scattered amongst an obscene number of televisions. The service has been reliably pleasant and the servers are generally good on getting into the spirit. 

I suppose the best way to end this review is some sort of play on words such as  ""Chalk up a victory for Winner's Circle"" or maybe ""No one loses when they go to Winner's Circle."" Perhaps ""Compared to Winner's Circle, all other sports bars are square losers"".... yeah, I think I'll go with that.",2009-03-29 03:31:39
NfaMDSZcVnx8CPx0uUfZdg,aD4UZNOxh9abKzkHyd31Sw,C2vKa-eZFVBrfFGYXxvXFw,3.0,9,0,0,"My husband and I came here on their second night. At a restaurant that had been open longer, I would be giving two stars because of the service problems, but I'm willing to forgive some issues at a place that's still so new.

We decided to try this place on a whim. First problem: the parking lot is WAY too small to accommodate even a 3/4 full restaurant. There's no real other place to try and go either. We got majorly lucky that we didn't have to circle a few times. Although we got seated right away, it took a really long time before anyone noticed us. To the point where you consider going up to the front podium for a manager, or just walking out. Again, a big problem at an established place, but more forgivable on night two.

The menu is definitely comprehensive, and you'll find all your Mexican classics. But here's the rub: this place will nickel-and-dime you to death. Want more chips? That's a $1. Want more salsa? Was a side of sour cream? Want to split a dish? Want certain refills? Alllll extra. Little fees all over the menu. Not ideal. I can't think of a single GOOD Mexican place that charges for another basket of chips or a small side of sour cream. They also have a $10 debit/credit minimum.

That all being said, we did enjoy the meal on the whole. For about $45 (before tip), my husband and I each got a soft drink, the queso fundido (the chorizo in it was tasty, but the cheese was a little runny for my husband's liking); a 3-part combo with rice, two taquitos, and an enchilada; a 2-part combo with rice and two chicken quesadillas; a side of sour cream (extra $1) and the sopapilla desert. The sopapilla was a little flatter and tougher than I'd have liked, but it wasn't bad. I thought the enchilada was good, and the taquitos were quite delicious. It was definitely more than enough food. If we were to do it again, we'd do the items a la carte and skip the totally average rice.

I'm willing to give this place another try, despite the really slow service and the 'nickel-and-dime the customer' attitude. I wasn't really in the mood to try diving into their apparently extensive tequila list that night, but that could be worth going back for in-of-itself. Let's hope they get the service aspect down better.",2015-01-10 04:11:50

I was in the mood for some wings but tired of chain restaurant type settings so I wanted to try something new. I didn't really want a dinner I just wanted some picky type foods.   We ordered onion rings, ranch fries, and wings (mild). I went easy with it lol wasn't trying to be too daring.  The wings were nice and crispy they hit the spot. They really had a good taste. My only negative I would say is I wish the sauce was a little thicker to coat the wings better.  The ranch fries were really good. Totally hit the spot. The onion rings were good, average. Typical onion rings not said in a bad way  they were good but nothing that woulda put it over the top with a unique zing. Now again a quick reminder I'm not a drinker and I don't go to bars often.  I really liked this place and the feel of it.  The food was good and the prices were good as well. I kno I'm def coming back. I would have definitely stayed longer but so sad that four annoying people who wanted to still be young were overly loud, obnoxious and annoying. This has nothing to do with the establishment but I just wanted to put it out there for people like this.  You made a really nice place with good food annoying because you were so loud and just so annoying child like. Know what your limits of alcohol consumption is before getting on other peoples nerves who were also there to have a nice night out.   Anyways I'm definitely coming back hoping the next time I come it's minus four people that were there tonight.  Lol.

Came back again tonight. This time I got the hot wings. Oh my these wings are the bomb!  Once you pick one up you don't wanna stop.  It's a beautiful thing lol.  The onions rings were awesome. Super crispy and delish this time and those ranch fries yea they also are a beautiful thing.  Then let me tell you what blew my mind.  The damn French dip sandwich with Swiss cheese and on some buttery toasted garlicky goodness of a bread that your gonna dip in the delicious au jou.

Anyway after finishing the job (and many Yelp reviews of car related services later) I noticed that there was a small clanging noise in one of my wheels.  I decided it being my brakes, I should make sure that I did this properly.  I decided to take it to Pep Boys on Vets.

Kathy, who seems to be the Commander in Chief of the service department was very nice and said that they would be very happy to look over the brakes and asked me if I had a Pep Boys Rewards card.  I did not.  She said that normally a brake check is $14.99 but if I just grab one of those cards sitting at the registerer and sign up for free than the brake job would be free as well.  Wow.

The only negative was that Kathy didn't mention that it would probably be over an hour before a tech was able to get to my car...  Luckily after an hour I asked another employee how many cars were in front of me and he came back and said that he moved me to the front of the line and that a tech was going to stop working on a car and work on mine to get me out of there.

My tech was Gary (the one with glasses, not the beard) and he was awesome.  When I went outside to his bay, he had already taken my car for a test drive to listen for the noise and had my tires off.  He inspected my work and said I did a great job.  He said he thought the noise was coming from a heat shield that was too close to the rotor.  Nothing dangerous but could cause the slight noise I heard so he corrected that.  He let me watch him check all four wheels and showed me tips for the next time I attempt this.

He checked my brake fluid level for me and corrected the overfill and then explained why I need to have my brake lines bled (I pushed dirty brake fluid back into the lines when I reset the caliper pistons).

After he was done, we took a test drive to listen for the noise and it was fixed.  He again gave me some great car tips and was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.

Just as promised, the bill came to $0 when they signed me up for the Rewards Card.  I bought some needed accessories and cleaning supplies to make up for this.  This Pep Boys location will definitely be my go-to auto parts store whenever I'm in town.",2014-01-15 15:41:02
EFJnXqw_N7OsLJwUThS23g,1GkZ41K7YaQudB0CnRJOyg,4EGJGPoqxyLZzVcO4feBXg,1.0,1,0,0,"Review for hotel stay on 12/31/11 and 2011 New Years Eve party. Sorry if this is long and in the wrong section. I didn't see any reviews on the NYE party so I wanted to make sure and cover it all.

PARKING: There are 2 entrances to the garage. You should pass the entrance that says Millennium Hotel parking. This will only get you into the first level of the garage. Even though it was completely full they continued to let cars in where we then sat, stuck with no where to go until someone figured out how to lift the arm up on the exit. There were ramps to get up to higher levels but they were blocked off. Valet is not an option here. $18

CHECK IN: This was a 2.5 hour ordeal!! I've never stayed here before so I'm hoping this was only due to the NYE party, however this was still ridiculous. One employee told me the computer systems were down/malfunctioning thats why it was taking so long. I'm pretty sure that was a lie b/c several other employees told me it's like that every year on NYE. The main thing that pissed me off about this check in wait was that I called the front desk several times to ask questions about the hotel and the party, even called earlier that day to ask when was the earliest I could check in. During these phone calls someone should have mentioned the long wait. I could have gotten there earlier.  At the very least I would have expected to stand in line for 2 hours. My friend theorized this was intentional so we would spend even more money at the overpriced bar with the outrageously rude bartender (I didn't go to the bar so I'll leave that for her review). I had some friends going to the Hyatt. They were told to come anytime, that the hotel knew alot of people would be checking in so rooms would be ready. Not sure how that went but sounds like a much better idea.

THE ROOM: We stayed in the old south tower. After reading the past reviews I was so nervous that our room was going to be unbearable. Definitely not one of the nicer rooms I've ever had but it didn't make me sick like I had expected. Old bubble back tv that wouldn't turn on. Alarm clock radio reminded of something I owned in the 80s but it worked. Lighting by any mirror was terrible for anyone that may need to put on makeup. 2 pillows per bed. Beds were comfy, nice fluffy down comforter. Pedestal sink in the bathroom gave no vanity space for hair and makeup supplies.

THE PARTY: Was to go from 8p-1a, consist of heavy hors d'oeuvres, premium bar, champagne toast, live music, and balloon drop.  
The Food: Was more than I expected. Lots of cheeses, fried apps, several pasta choices, fruit & veggies and a meat carving station with chicken, turkey, and beef. The beef was nice and tender and exceeded my expectation for 'buffet type' meat.  There were also desserts put out a little later but I didn't have any. There were a ton of people here and it was difficult to find a spot to sit. Once we sat with our food we had to wait in another line to get a drink......
The Drinks: There were several bars set up outside of the ballroom. One set of bars for wine/beer and one for liquor. I stuck with beer/wine as the line was usually shorter.  My friends wanted liquor and those lines were so much longer. Couldn't give a minute estimate on the wait but several times I would get a beer, then meet them in line. By the time we got up to the bar I was usually done with my beer. Spent alot of time waiting......The beer selection was good. I stuck with Mich Ultra but they also had Heineken, other Bud products and I might have even seen some Sam Adams? The premium bar included plain Absolut vodka and Jack Daniels. I can't remember what other liquor was served. My friend tried to get a plain soda one time but we were told we should get that from a server in the ballroom. We didn't see any server in the ballroom so we stuck with cocktails:) They would have you believe the bar would be open from 8p-1a (the extent of the party) however the bars shut down and served their last drinks around 12:30p. This led to an issue between me and a staff member named Jay.
The Staff: Most of the staff we came in contact with was super friendly and pleasant to talk to. Specifically we remember chatting with bartenders Nelson, Janise, and Brandon. They kept us laughing! Almost everytime we passed an employee they were saying Enjoy your night, happy new year or something similar. However Jay ruined it for all of them. After asking him why the bars were closing before the party was over he spoke to me so rudely and disrespectful that I definitely plan to make a specific complaint about him separate from the yelp review. And I know I'm running short on characters...
This is not a NYE event I would recommend to anyone. While I did have a fun night I credit that to myself for being able to laugh off even the most asinine situations. Most of the night was spent waiting to wait to wait for something else. Not worth the $343",2012-01-04 22:47:40
UpvPL0o9MEmh5IMNDGXPpA,dmHtz-O3C3YAMNnyyhjodg,bLC3frEZCtstsrfjmJMJiw,1.0,6,3,2,"Get In. And Join The Family.

That is the slogan/ catch phrase of Dolan Toyota. Since our first interaction with Dolan back in 2014 , when we bought our FJ, I hadn't always quite got the catch phrase but was pleasantly surprised with their service aspect. It is by no means a family environment but the service department was always a good experience.

Like any car dealership buying experience, it is never perfect, but our salesman Drew was awesome. Friendly and efficient and has kept in contact with us over the years we deciding on new vehicle options. Because of the actual purchase, the addendum and the shady practice of laminating a new MSRP we did not purchase our 2017 from Dolan but we did continue to go there for service. We took the drive to Carson City for our purchase. 

The real jewel of the dealership is the service department and customer service. Well it used to be. From the first ""new owner"" dinner, to parts purchase to all regularly scheduled maintenance appointments; I have also been happy with the process from start to finish. Never a hiccup or anything that wasn't quickly resolved and with a smile. Today not only was the ball dropped, it was kicked, deflated and dragged behind my vehicle as I pulled out of the service bay.
 
I must say that my first impression, I thought maybe my own crankiness from the drive may have been influencing my opinion. I had been stuck in considerable traffic from Tahoe down to my appointment. When I called, the operators were super friendly, never even asked for my name and told me that any appointment had a grace period and just come on in. Usually as you pull into the service drive someone, or several people will wave you in. I came in and about 5-6 people in blue shirts to the right of me were talking. A girl came over to check me in, she said hello. Very dry and non-super friendly, but she was somewhat efficient. Went over the vehicle, checked for damage, got the miles. It seemed much longer than it usually takes, but I got the impression she was new. She asked me for my name and how to spell it. She asked me to initial by the vehicle inspection, now granted I did not pay attention to it- and that will come up again. I thought I was signing the vehicle inspection. NO OTHER QUESTIONS were asked.

She then took me over to the side of the service bay that is marked Allstate, but apparently, that is where we go now. When she opened the door, there were several different desks with I'd say about 3-4 twenty somethings. One was one her phone which she promptly put down. The first girl asked Ashley is she was available. So, then I went to Ashley's desk.

""Has this vehicle ever been here before?"" First question awesome, not hi, not how are you. I answered ""yes"", when what I wanted to say ""yes actually I bought it here and it has been here many times"". There were several uncomfortable moments why I sat at stared at Ashley. No small talk, no questions. She told me that they closed at 6 and to be back by then to get my vehicle. My reply ""well the only way I am leaving is with your shuttle driver so let's see if he gets me back"".

She then said your prepaid maintenance is covered. I told her I just wanted the scheduled maintenance, nothing else. I then asked if she would call the shuttle driver, as the last girl said she would.
""Actually, there is a list you sign"". She got up, and I followed her to the lobby. No instructions, just implied by her getting up.

I then met the shuttle driver. He said it would be no problem to take me where I needed to go. He took me to Sears, waited for me and was conversational. He was really the only customer service I encountered. He was pleasant and nice.

When I got back I sat till right before closing. I had attempted twice to go to the parts counter for a drink and no one ever even asked if I needed help, I settled for the vending machine. I noticed at about 10 till the activity increased. Ike everyone was rushing to finish up. Ashley came out to give me my paperwork.

She said ""your vehicle is done, we didn't wash it like requested"". 
To which I replied, ""I didn't request that, in fact no one even asked me"".
Then she said ""do you have aftermarket parts, because we don't do that anymore.

Really, because our grill has been on the last two times you did service and never a mention of it. In addition, it is now your policy that because we choose to install something ourselves your dealership doesn't offer a basic wash? That question is geared toward your service manager, it was not something I asked. I just told her whatever. 

 She then said ""we went ahead of took of your oil change"".

This irritates me beyond words, I specifically said I just wanted the maintenance and no oil change. I drive a lot of miles and I prefer to keep it scheduled as needed. This is something you should ASK the customer before doing. Period.

She went to get my vehicle and left my paperwork with the cashier. I was so irritated that the shuttle driver must have",2017-07-22 02:55:20

Mistake!!!!! There was only 6 persons at the bar with 3 sushi chefs. Two guys sitting next to me, we're ordering like crazy .. I ordered two rolls .. We were finished and the chefs were speaking with this two guys on the end about being a journeyman and helping getting the chef a job with them blah blah ..

The two guys had four rolls made for them and I'm still frekn waiting for my daughters roll and mussels. 15 minutes go by ..

Another 6 minutes go by the two guys on the end had another four rolls and us still nothing ... I looked at the other chef who I ordered the midtown and said do you have that midtown ?? Oh he says I never ordered that !! Umm I said yes I did with the mussels , he says you didn't order mussels .. Meanwhile the other chef who took my order for a sweetheart is putting dishes away ?? I asked do you have the sweetheart roll .. He's says no you didn't order that .. And three more rolls go,to the guys on the end. !! Now I'm pissed... I said how bout the mussels .. I hear the kitchen say you said scallops !!! Wtf!!

PIW7j5LaU1N6KPPO-ax0jg,SUAFCKtkx8RrQ6EgJQIVrw,6RBZfirnzE4NahJTn1UPNA,2.0,8,7,2,"Don't waste your time standing in line here. The tacos were not impressive and the 2-hour wait was ludicrous.

This establishment is famous supposedly because Julia Child once said she likes to eat tacos here. I, like any well-seasoned foodie, solicit the opinions of old, white, American women when shopping for Mexican food.

La Super-Rica Taqueria has a major problem. They need a simple policy that states that any given human ordering at the counter cannot order more than 10 menu items. That seems like a no-brainer to me at least. When I visited, a single person in front of me in line ordered 120 tacos for the entire Yale University Women's Basketball Team. I'm 100% serious here. After one poor soul, probably a freshman bench-warmer, waited for 2-hours in line for food, they put in this gigantic order, which was fulfilled in the form of cardboard boxes full of tacos. This led one such suburban mother of four to yell, ""I know it's the holiday season and all, but I hope you all lose."" 

Because of not instituting this 10-item limit policy, the line itself is not a good indicator of the wait time. For instance, if you are in line for The Hulk roller coaster at Universal's Islands of Adventure and you are the next person in line for the ride, it would be mildly infuriating to see the entire Yale University Women's Basketball Team cut in front of you last second. 

The fact is that Yale weren't the only people cheating the system that day. Because the long line here is a known entity, only noobs would wait in line when a loser can do all the waiting on your behalf. Thus, everyone who is a local sends out a Super-Rica Taqueria ""courier,"" who is presumably the most insecure of the bunch. To put this in math terms, if you were to see the line out the door here is TTTTTLTTLT long where ""T"" is a tourist and ""L"" is a local, then to an outsider, the line is 10 persons long. Usually, that can be interpreted that 10 people have food orders in front of you. However, if each ""L"" local is a surrogate for a large basketball team, that line is secretly up to 8+33+33= 74 persons long. Thus is born the mystery of the super long wait at this restaurant. When only about 30 people are in line for food, it takes 2-hours to actually sit down and eat. 

This logistical failure led one patron to finally stand up and say, ""That's it! I'm driving back to L.A.!"" after waiting over 2-hours for his food that never came. Seriously, some unkind words were exchanged between ticket holder #47 and ticket holder #48. 

Okay, okay. So the wait is 2-hours long. Big deal. But obviously the food is worth it, right? Not in the slightest. Our group ordered a solid mix of tacos, quesadillas, and even specials from the menu. Only two things were outstanding: the chili relleno with cream and the ""rajas,"" which was a grilled pepper and melted cheese taco. Certainly delicious. But the Adobada pork and steak tacos were shockingly dull - overcooked, bland, rubbery. Sure, the tortillas themselves are made from scratch, but they can't make bad meat taste good. 

On the plus side, I met a fellow economist in line and we had ample time to peer-review a journal article draft for publication.",2017-01-07 09:49:18

As a single adult with a disability who lives alone, I'm definitely not paranoid about my safety but after having had a couple break-ins at my home I also committed myself to at least doing what I can do to maintain a safe environment. 

After the ending of my contract with my previous provider, I opted to explore the market a little bit given recent advancements in home security and the growth of the digital revolution in the industry. I initially opted for AT&T's Digital Life given my positive history with AT&T in terms of U-Verse, but after a couple of false starts and failures on their part I decided to go a different route. 

While I'd certainly heard of Guardian Protection Services, it wasn't until I saw their sign at a local business I particularly respect that I decided to explore them further. The timing was good with Black Friday and the holidays leading to special offers galore. While Guardian isn't an advertising heavy company, they do have a pretty strong web presence and I was able to find a deal that sounded intriguing and would allow me to provide my home with the security I desired. I

I submitted an e-mail inquiry to find out more. I submitted the request on the Thanksgiving holiday weekend and was contacted the following Monday afternoon. I consider this to be excellent timing - it's not obsessive as I despise companies that call you right away, but it's also not a significant delay that allows you too much time to explore other options. The person I spoke with was friendly and helpful, but not pushy or doing an incredible hard-sell. 

We arranged an appointment for the next evening and Vernon, one of Guardian's local representatives arrived on time and in an ""unmarked"" vehicle (but they did have I.D.). Vernon was friendly and helpful. He was aware that I'd responded to an online ad, but wasn't aware of which one (which I think is a good thing - it allows him to suggest what will work rather than going with the expected). He checked out my home, made suggestions, and we discussed pricing. He made a couple extra recommendations, I accepted one of the two, and he did his best it seemed to get me a system that would meet my needs within my budget. He created an option with medical alert that truly was helpful given my health challenges, though he presented it in a way that was not condescending. He was friendly, personable, and professional. He talked about being with Guardian for a considerable period of time and his affection for the company was obvious. 

After discussing pricing, options, the system itself, and time commitment, I opted to go with the offer despite my having reservations about a five-year commitment (which is my only true concern with Guardian - five years is simply unreasonable given the changes in technology and service limits). 

They primarily install during the week, but do have some weekend options. I scored a Saturday morning install within a week and the person did as arranged by calling me 30-minutes before arrival. The installer took between 3-4 hours to install the system and spent the needed time to ensure I understood everything. When I wasn't quite happy with the positioning on one system option, he changed it without hesitation. He was friendly, helpful, and obviously knew his stuff. He also knew how to explain the system in a non-technical way that made it all user friendly. I was genuinely impressed. He also spoke highly of the company in a sincere way. 

I am incredibly happy with Guardian and if I could, it would easily be a 4 1/2 star rating. However, I can't quite justify a five-star due to a couple of administrative issues that I think do matter. While I am a believer in ""you get what you pay for,"" I truly think the five-year agreement is a bit extreme as it doesn't allow for advances in technology and/or simply changes in life circumstances. I realize there's a cost to systems, but it seems like there would be a more customer friendly way to address the need to be fiscally responsible. I was also informed that after 90 days there's a deductible on equipment/service issues. This seems contradictory - I have to pay on the equipment for five years, but you'll only guarantee it for 90 days? That bugs me. Admittedly, the deductible is only $25 (I believe) but I think it sends the message that you don't stand behind your equipment. 

These are minor quibbles. I'm definitely a fan and excited to have the new system in place. With this system, I feel far more secure in my home than I did previously and I appreciated that from the first phone call to Vernon to install, I feel like everyone went above and beyond and did so in a way that was upbeat, friendly, helpful, and caring. I have a system that will be monitored for less than $50 a month and my home and health are much more protected.",2014-12-06 17:35:30

Our experience dining there, however, left a little something to be desired.  

We walked in and were seated at one of the non-BBQ tables almost immediately.  And then we sat and waited for someone to take our order.  And waited.  And waited.  We nearly got up to leave when finally a waitress rushed to our table to take our drink orders.  At this point, we were ready to order our food as well.  When we mentioned we wanted the tableside BBQ, we were told that we *should* have told them that from the beginning.  The waitress ran away to ask someone else if we could be seated at one of the BBQ tables, and 10 minutes later, came back to move us and take our orders.

We ordered 3 main dishes (hey, we were hungry): the beef bulgogi, the sirloin and spicy squid with noodles.  The first 2 were BBQ dishes.  The waitress came back to the table with the typical Korean side dishes, all of which were good, none of which were stellar.  The problem wasn't with the side dishes - it was with the fact that they were thrown at us (literally tossed onto the table) so she could get to one of the other tables.  Same with the raw meat for the BBQ - there was no demonstration on how to cook it.  After we'd let the grill heat for a bit, we placed the meat onto the BBQ and the waitress quickly came back to tell us we were doing it wrong and we shouldn't have started without her.  Um, if you say so.  After rushing back to us (seriously, this woman was logging some miles that night), she turned the meat over and almost pulled it off the grill to serve to us - halfway cooked.  We politely asked her to keep it on for a bit longer, which she did.  We began pulling the meat off ourselves when we were ready to eat it.

The spicy squid was pretty good, though we didn't care for the angel-hair pasta served with it.  We were expecting an udon-type noodle, so the thin, weak strands of pasta threw us for a textural loop within the dish.

Would we return?  Maybe, if we were craving BBQ.  We live too far away to return just because we're craving Korean.  My husband joked that if we were going to go that far for Korean food, we might as well hop a plane and head to NYC - or Korea, for that matter!",2014-07-21 19:59:19
ZLNXqje5ONiK81JYqaCIiQ,3QnoTcrxuafMCoTzW_AH7A,eJDUZMLSwYT8QRKbZVTZKg,4.0,7,5,7,"Can a Philadelphia Eagle (Brent Celek) and the chef of Prime Stache open a delicious Korean inspired restaurant right in the midst of the hustle and bustle on Broad Street? You betcha! You better bop on over to bop! 

My husband wanted to take me out on a day date (it's our new thing and I LOVE it!)! ""There's a new restaurant that just opened up where Bliss used to be. I want to take you there"" he said. I of course won't eat anywhere I haven't cross referenced on Yelp. It turned out I had it bookmarked. Great minds... Well, you know. 

We were fans of the location's previous owners, dining there many times. We wondered how a new place would compare in such a prime location. It has to be fairly tasty to do well here. First of all, the the space itself...the renovations were gorgeous and the updated layout, super smart. Much more seating outside to enjoy people watching and views of City Hall. There's a balcony upstairs for private parties I'm assuming. Banquet seating around the edges allowing more people to squeeze in too. 

There's and a huge, inviting square bar with two flat screens in the middle for game day. The bartender was super welcoming to anyone and everyone who took a seat. So much so I wondered if he knew them all. The bar looks like a great place to take a load off after a long day.  

The new space can fit many more people now and that's a great thing because they're going to need the room for all of the patrons they're going to have stopping by. I think bop is a great fit for this locale and will be around awhile. 

The decor was just my style. You are greeted with one single, gorgeous statement orchid as you walk in. Crisp, white subway tiles all around and some oh so trendy air plants and faux skulls with a touch of greenery giving the space a sleek, urban, yet bohemian feel. Loved it all! 

Ok, now to the juicy stuff!! Literally. 
What did we order you ask? One of everything please. 

A complimentary trio of Kimchee was served first. The cabbage was good. Zucchini even better, but the peppers in the middle were just so flavorful! I could've eaten just a whole bowl of those! Spicy!! 

Korean fries with spicy ketchup. 
Delicious and crispy.  Spicy, not overly so. Just a tad tangy. For just $3, I say get a bowl for the table to snack on.

Edamame Ravioli with Kombu broth and truffle oil. (10) 4 large ravioli to an appetizer order. Garnished beautifully with pea shoots and edamame. Soft and subtle, soupy with warm, tasty broth. Worth a shot. 

Tempura rock shrimp with chili oil- (12) Just as crispy, perfectly seasoned and mayonnaise-y as the ones at his favorite spot. With that being said, if you've had it elsewhere, skip it here. It's smaller bites than we've seen and it's been done. While yes, it's delish, I say go for something unique to this spot. There are so many options to choose from. 

I was so torn between which salad to order. They all honestly sounded so delicious and somewhat inventive. I went with the Chop. It was towering and gorgeous in color. Light yet filling. I had half of it leftover for dinner later. It was crunchy, dressed to perfection and that nice blend of sweet and savory I like so much with the mix Korean pears and roasted peanuts. You can add a protein to any salad for a small additional cost. 

The KFC Wings I think stole the show for my husband. We both agreed they were the biggest wings we have ever seen. My guy was so adorable eating them. Gooey, sticky sauce all over his cheeks. Ladies, stay away from these if you're on a first date. :) Spicy, but not too much he said and very crisp because they're double fried. He had some leftover so we brought them to my parents. They both said they were the best wings they've EVER had! 

I did notice the man next to us making love to his meal. I just had to ask what he was dining on...The Bulgogi (sliced ribeye Bibimbop) which he said was ""outrageous"". Perhaps give that a try. 

The nachos looked so appealing too. Hello, pickled shishito! Sound so interesting! 

Perhaps next time I'll order the Mushroom Bibimbop. It sounds amazing with 4 different types of 'shrooms. Yea baby! 

Drinks- Hubby got his watermelon beer and I wanted a Thai Basil Lemonade. Apparently it wasn't ready as they just opened last week. I did notice some alcohol being infused behind the bar, perhaps that's what the waitress meant by not ready....still infusing. I did however love the Philly inspired names of the cocktails. The Rittenhouse, The Philadelphian, and The Ave Of The Arts to name a few. They all looked carefully crafted and desirable. 

Our waitress was very much on top of water refills and clearing plates. The food came out in a timely manor, with a smile. Prices were reasonable and portions, generous. We have no complaints at all and will be returning. 

Fab Philly Mom says: Go ahead,leave the kids home for this one. There's not a ton on the menu for them and what is, is spicy. Enjoy a date. You deserve it!",2016-05-28 11:10:04
vatqiSz5utcVfsH5whaUug,v1iZWfHMYFDsaTAJAGTPhg,qawVgyG2JoSOrZLtqXwpLw,4.0,2,0,2,"APRIL 18, 2020 - the world is still closed.  Walking in the most serene and beautiful places in this Truckee Meadows valley has been quite therapeutic for SO MANY reasons.  As we're faced with death, economic trauma, record-unemployment, sickness...all the things that this world is surrounded with at this time - YOU NEED TO STEP OUT and breathe fresh air!  Your sanity, your family, co-workers, ex-coworkers, neighbors and community will thank you for releasing the pressure of all this stress.

Why I love Mayberry Park:

Reasons why I love this park are sentimental:  my family and I have spent many GREAT days here - from taking family pictures and many magical strolls (one with my beloved German Shepherd who didn't mesh well in this life) and having the best ""talk therapy"" times with friends while we savor the natural beauty, sing-a-long with the ""cheeseburger"" birds, and listening to the roaring Truckee River alongside you.

Now, I know by the steel gray bridge, located to the west side of the park, there is an awesome wonderland of trailheads that you can enjoy - I've only done 2, and forgive me, I don't remember the names - but there are many helpful and resourceful apps like All Trails and Footpath that you can explore and plan your route beforehand.  I know you will ENJOY any and ALL of these trails!

Don't forget a picnic lunch - many tables in the cove next to the bridge with the fabulous riverfront view!

What I didn't care for:

Hadn't spotted any public restrooms - and that's a darn shame.  So word to the wise:  EMPTY BLADDER right before you park your car and get started for your walk.  The nearest public restroom is the Chevron gas station about a mile east on 4th and McCarran.

The wood planks on the steel gray bridge NEED repair and they need to be spaced closer together.  My doodle got her paw stuck in between and it was quite frightening for her.  Some spots are so LOUD and creaky - a bit intimidating with the sound of the rushing river under your feet.  REALLY?  There is NO WAY my toy poodle would be able to cross that without having a traumatic experience himself.  Just WALK SLOWLY across this bridge and look where your feet are stepping.  I cannot stress that enough.  1-star is removed from my review - I feel it's very unsafe.

But...4 stars for BEAUTY, well-maintained trails, ZERO dog doo-doo, and having ample parking for as many folks as I saw today!  

Have a wonderful time and don't forget to BREATHE out there...with your mask hanging on your neck :).

7ESgJV03DO3lobXHFwsEMA,AtfoNnP2wlYmBjK5LAIUSw,TF9Kq-xq7J6Kd3_E0Xl5HQ,3.0,0,0,0,"I've been 3 times - once was a few years ago for drinks with friends, and it was fine, probably a 3 or 4 star experience. The last two times were for pub trivia semifinals (two weeks ago) and finals (yesterday.) The second time was a 3 or 4, but the most recent earned 2 stars. So I'll give them 3 for now.

All of the drinks I've had there are quite tasty. Their Moscow mule and the mango-pineapple-cider drink are both refreshing. They don't taste too strong, if that's what you're looking for. Their old-fashioneds are pretty strong, in my experience.

The menu doesn't have much for herbivores. The veggie burger is appreciated, though. The one I got two weeks ago was delicious. I ordered mango salsa instead of regular and it was great. I ordered it again this time and the waitress looked at me funny when I asked about the mango salsa. She said she'd look into it, and I said it was fine if they didn't have it.

I had to wait longer than I'd normally expect, but not an absurd amount of time. When a runner brought it out, though, the bun was very soggy. The patty was warm but the bottom bun and the salsa were cold. The salsa and/or ranch was too spicy for me too, but I would have just scraped it off and eaten it anyway, were it not for the sogginess and the temperature issues. When she made her way back to the table, I politely told the waitress about the sogginess and temperature and she just stood there looking at it until I asked if it could please be remade. I also asked if I could just get regular ranch next time, since I wondered if the mango salsa had masked the spiciness of the chipotle ranch last time. I've never had an issue with any sort of ranch, but you never know. I was really hungry and wanted to eat soon, so I played it safe. I asked about the mango salsa again and said if they had it, great. She didn't know if they did.

She brought it back a few minutes later with no sauce whatsoever. I asked about the ranch and salsa. She said, ""Oh, we're out of mango salsa."" ""Okay, that's fine, can you bring me the ranch like I said, and the regular salsa for the side?"" I'd made it clear previously that I'd like regular ranch on there. I could see why there was some confusion about the salsa, but even then, not really. Blank-faced, she left and then returned with them. 

Once I got to try them separate from each other, I found that the salsa was the spicy component, so I left it off. Good to know! The burger was pretty tasty. I like the bun it comes on. The patty falls apart pretty easily, though. The jasmine rice, which was my side, was delicious. I can't remember my side two weeks ago, except that I liked it a lot.

For dessert I ordered the cookie pie. It's just two big cookies with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. I prefer cookies to be soft, but these were a little harder/crunchier. If you like cookies that way, you'll like the desert a lot. The portion is pretty big too. It was fine, but I doubt I'll order it again.

Overall, it's not bad. Given the sum of my experiences, I wouldn't say no if someone suggested going here, but I probably wouldn't choose it on my own unless it was just for drinks.",2016-12-05 16:16:19

I was so happy when i found a page with 5 coupons with ruby buffet in cherry hill at the top. I called and they said that i could use that coupon. It was the kind you dont have to print,you just hit redeem now. When  I first got there at 700 pm for dinner, it was great. The food was fresh. The waitress dropped off crab leg trash bowls. So I was like awesome can't wait to have crab legs. Go to get some and there is literally a line of 10 people waiting for this medium sized pan to be filled. I decided to come back later. Well later never changed anything. Still a line. Finally decided to wait and I literally waited in line for 15 minutes. And you had to wait because if you didn't you would never get any. Got crab legs,which were good but not waiting 15 minutes in line good. I tried to track down my mia  waitress on numerous occasions to get a napkin or a drink refill and was met with her rushing by averting her eyes every time. Finally had to yell excuse me but can I please get a napkin. And mia wasn't her name by the way,that stands for missing in action if you didn't catch that. Lol! really? okay,the rest of the food was good and fresh. Then came the time to pay. I showed my phone with the coupon and the waitress took it to the front and came back and said my manager said we can't take this you have to go print it out. I told her that it isn't a printable coupon you press redeem and use now. She said sorry talk to.manager! so I did and she was very rude and said I can't take that you have to print it. I explained that I called and was told I could use it and still I can't use it. Really,just give good customer service and honor the 2.00-3.00 off. I said even after I waited in line for crab legs for 15 minutes. She was very rude and didn't care. This buffet is more expensive than the average buffet because of the crab legs which are so inaccessible. I was so offended by how rudely I was treated that no matter how good or fresh the food was I felt sick to my stomach. So yes most of the food was fresh but very, very poor customer service from management and waitress. I will not be going back. No food is worth being treated so rudely,fresh or not. Go somewhere else. I will!",2016-02-20 04:09:04
U-3wtNwELibxvlaAeqCrnw,1p8Pu1pvAsuNtuZDtn2OkQ,8ffThSJtfek7B1XoNg2uXQ,3.0,2,0,0,"Let me preface this with my daughter had a great time and pretty much everything went right at a party she was at. I'm writing this in the context of being the former manager of an unrelated and not competing game room.

Had my shop been in the condition this one was I would have been written up, most of the staff would have.

We'll start with initial impressions - we were the first ones in that day. My daughter ran toward the climbing/tube structure and immediately picked up a well used lollipop off of the entry climb area. There was also a wrapper of some sort higher up. The lollipop was well within adult vision and cleaning range. Cleaned that off of her.

The place had been given a wipedown the night before, but it had been rode hard and put up wet. The upper structure appeared filthy. Don't think anyone'd cleaned it. Going to preface here I may be mistaken as I wasn't actually in the upper structure. I just ended up with a dirty kid.

Party time was great, food was good, the animatronic Chuck E Cheese had stains on the shirt where it appeared someone had caked him a day or two back. Live action Chuck was fine.

A guest at the party handed me a key thinking I'd dropped it as it was so odd looking. It was an ace key, the ones that get you either into the games, or the ones that get you into the cash to change machines. I didn't test which one it was, I just handed it to the employee who was handling the party. Losing that key was a several hundred dollar proposition at my store as the locks would have had to have been changed.

As the party wore on, unrelated children started wandering into the party area, there was no fencing off. Not that we really cared, every kid was having a good time. One random kid who it was her birthday but had not purchased a birthday party tried edging in on the actual party girl's time, but nothing too annoying.

The person who was directing the party/cutting cake/etc did a great job wrangling kiddos, let a few into the ticket tornado, I think they walked away with 3 tickets. It was just fun for the kids.

Skee ball was down to two lanes, the first missing all balls since the opening and the last a coin jam. There was a coin shooter jammed up. A coin accepter literally fell out of a machine. The ticket counters were skipping tickets (put five in, get 3-4 credited,) and generally every fourth game had something wrong with it.

Now, the games were clean, they'd cleaned those up well.

Party enjoyed it, most people had to get a machine worked on or told of lost tokens. Needs a scrubbing and some work, still fun.",2016-04-15 14:27:43

Although $69.55 (including tax) for an individual is higher than most gyms in the area, I believe you get what you pay for.  At the PEAC, have never had to wait for a cardio machine, the group classes are timely, effective, and INCLUDED in your membership, the locker rooms are immaculately clean, and the hours are convenient.  

The convenience of towel service goes a long way for my early morning workouts.  There is always a staff member on hand in the locker room, cleaning and offering supplies when necessary.  The shower stalls in the women's locker room are HUGE.  There is a sauna, steam room, and tanning bed for those that wish to use them and private dressing rooms are available as well. 

I also must say nothing ever stays broken at the PEAC.  If a machine requires maintenance, it is addressed within 24 hours. I once noticed a hinge on one of the wooden lockers was broken.  The next day, it was fixed.  Impressive.  

The facilities include a large cardio  area, weight machines, heavy lifting rooms with free weights, raquetball courts, squash courts, tennis courts, an indoor track, and three studios.  The cardio area has large flat screen tvs with 4 tv channels and 4 music channels from which to choose.  The only downside is that if you're looking for a fitness center with a pool, PEAC does not have one.  

Child care services and activities are available for those that need them, although I am not aware if they are included in the membership cost or not.  Personal trainers and massage sessions are extra, but available.

Every member is given a complimentary fitness evaluation upon sign-up.  The evaluation includes an assessment of your fitness and workout suggestions to target your weaker areas.  A complimentary follow-up evaluation is also available.  

There typically are sign-up specials (especially in the summer months) to help discount or waive initiation fees, so I would suggest researching them before joining. Also, look for discounts for government employees, employees of local businesses, families, and joint spouse memberships.

The staff is courteous and I have never failed to receive a ""Happy Birthday"" phone call from them each year.  PEAC strives to be very involved with the community, as evidenced by the various events on their monthly calendar.

If you live in the surrounding townships, odds are you won't have traffic on your way to the PEAC because it is not in a highly congested area.  

Obviously, I love the PEAC.  I was forced to join another gym when I moved away from the area for two years.  Although the replacement gym received high ratings, it just didn't compare to the PEAC. Every other facility is a disappointment in comparison to the PEAC.  I'm glad to be back.",2011-05-24 15:30:49
-Pe_zVr2rHxjYA4eCpfarA,b1PZl9M4MzVEkussj5x1tA,EH-cgqLfrYdZmKdNM7kuyA,5.0,7,2,2,"I have likely had too many animals in my day, and I've moved around a bit*, so I've used many different vets over the years. Most of them, except for Banfield, located within PetSmart
stores, have been fine. Dr. Peter Batts of Trenton Veterinary Hospital stands alone, though, as the best of the best. He has another practice in Frenchtown, but makes his way down to Trenton a few times a week for appointments and surgeries, at his location on Rt. 31/Pennington Road, across from the reservoir. 

Dr. Batts is an Englishman: proper and dignified, not particularly warm, but not prickly, either. His fondness for pets is apparent, but it's also plain that he feels a duty to serve them, as well. We humans domesticated them, after all. We get so much in return for our relationship with animals, and the doctor is upholding humanity's end of the deal. Sure, there are losers out there who fight dogs, or who ditch their cat simply because they're moving. But then there's Dr. Batts, humanity's best ambassador, reminding our animal friends that their continued arrangement with us does have significant perks for them, as a whole. And, his presence in Trenton allows so many underprivileged people the joy of pet ownership. His prices are so reasonable, largely, I'm sure, because there is no tropical rain forest (with waterfall!) located within the lobby (saw that once), there's no fancy furniture. It's no frills, except for the quality of services.

I should mention that Dr. Batts also saved my cat, Simon, two years ago. The cat is now 13, and healthy. But back then, he had a chronic upper respiratory infection along with some bad teeth, and, as I came to discover, a ""cauliflower tumor"" in the back of this throat. I was recently divorced and broke, and was hoping for -- and did not get -- good news about the cat. The doctor sighed heavily and asked me if I had recently won the lottery, because the cat really should see a specialist for major surgery. For all the talk of cats' multiple lives, apparently oral diseases are rampant in the feline community, giving rise to the need for specialists. I had not, in fact, won the lottery, and I felt my face get warm, and the tears build up with unexpectedly speed: I thought he was going to recommended putting Simon down. But the doctor said, ""I have not seen a case this bad, but I will do what I can for him, here. I'm not a specialist, but I'll do my best."" He was so earnest, so concerned for my cat. He prescribed a mega dose of antibiotics to get Simon cleared up for surgery, scheduled for a few weeks later.

The day I brought Simon back in, we happened to encounter a family saying goodbye to their dog. Their wails unhinged me, and I cried along with them; I understood their grief. Dr. Batts poked his head into the lobby, and wordlessly conveyed that he was going to let the family take the time they needed. I nodded. A short time later, raw with the reminder that nothing is guaranteed in life, I left my cat behind. But I had faith that Dr. Batts would do his best -- for Simon, and cats in general. The severity of the infection was intriguing to the vet, and I think he felt he could learn a lot from Simon.

I got a call from the doctor himself a few hours later: surgery had gone well, but he had extracted nearly all of Simon's teeth along with the cauliflower** in the back of his mouth. He kept the cat for another day, just to make sure he was ok...and he was. Simon ate like a pig, for the first time in ages, his recuperating mouth less painful than his his previous condition.

Dr. Batts called me again, a couple weeks later, to check on Simon - the cat's condition had been so dire, apparently; Dr. Batts was pleased in his properly British way, to hear Simon had regained some weight, and was back to his playful self.

I was pleased too. I am truly grateful for Dr. Batts, but I also know there's so much mystery in that area between life and death, and we may not have nearly as much control as we think we do. But it's good to have someone you trust when you're faced with that situation. Dr. Batt's is equally proficient at the more run-of-the-mill stuff associated with veterinary medicine. I made the mistake of bringing our new kitten to Banfield, thinking with 4 pets, it might make sense to have a back up vet. Huge error on my part. I'm sorry about that. I'll be sticking with Dr. Batts from here on out!

* An aside: to the people who give up pets because the landlord won't allow animals: you're doing it wrong. So very wrong.

** I am so against the cauliflower cheerleading that's going on in the food world, partially because it is absolutely not a substitute for chicken or potatoes; and turning it into a""bready"" canvas for pizza is simply a violation of all that's sacred. But I also am against the cauliflower cheerleading squad because my cat had a cauliflower extracted from his esophagus. You never hear about buffalo chicken tumors or mashed potato tumors, do you?!?!",2015-07-22 23:57:12

Well, I can tell you my story, and hopefully you get a laugh.  On the last day of my vacation, I was flying out of Nashville's airport on a Delta flight at 5:15pm, I had woken up that morning in a hotel in Columbus, Mississippi about 250+ miles southwest of there, and hit the road at about 10am in what might be the smallest rental car on the road today, the 2014 Chevy Spark. I made it almost all the way without stopping, but by 2:30pm, my bladder was ready to explode, and I had to pull off from I-65 for a bathroom break.  Noticing that I had a little time, and remembering that one of the dishes Nashville is famous for -- hot chicken -- was one I had not been able to try during the 3 days I had spent in town before my plans took me due south, I decided to drive back into the city and sample some.  On the notes I had made before my trip after consulting the Food Channel's web-site, the guy from Man vs. Food had made a stop at Prince's.  Unfortunately, today was Sunday, and a quick glance at Yelp! told me that they were closed all day.  A quick search for other Hot Chicken shacks in the area led me to Hattie B's, and between the sheer volume of reviews and the rating, I knew I had found the spot for my last meal before my flight.  I got the car parked and walked up a few minutes before 3pm -- plenty of time, right?  Uh, the line of people outside the door 10 deep made me wonder if this was such a wise choice.  It took me until  about 3:20 to make it in the door and to the register to place my order -- a white hot platter, with pimento cheesy mac, and southern (collard) greens, and a sweet tea; $12.  Now the REAL waiting began -- I realized that my order was at least 20 tickets back , and I could see the faces of people who were ordering at the register when I first got in line, NOT sitting, and more distressingly, NOT yet eating.  I made an appeal to the guy expediting all of the to-go orders, explaining that I had a flight to catch in less than 2 hours .......... no sympathy was to be had. ""Sunday is my busiest day, and we're only open until 4, so everybody's tired .......... want to change your order to go?""  Hoping that it might buy me some time, I agreed.  After much lip biting and hangnail picking, I finally got my bag of food, at about 3:50pm.  I ran out to my car and sped off for the highway, and the airport, which my GPS told me was 8 miles away.  Luckily, this being Sunday afternoon, the traffic was pretty light, and I made it to the Hertz rental car return lot by 4:10pm.  After what felt like , an hour having the car looked over by the guy with the clipboard, I signed my name, and ran for the terminal with my non-wheeled luggage strapped to my shoulders, and my sack of chicken in one hand, my iced tea in the other.  I checked my suit bag, and found a passenger lounge just before the mouse maze of ribbons courtesy of the TSA.  I sat down and opened the box, and the steam still rose out of the box and up my nose -- heaven!!! they serve it on a slice of white bread, to soak up the oil that had run out since it left the deep fryer.  It was hot, spicy, and just plain scrumptious.  I'm pretty sure I was moaning while I was chewing it up.  I was almost half way through the chicken before I had even remembered that there were sides to go with the chicken!!  The collards were a little too salty for my liking, but you could definitely taste the ham.  However, the pimento cheesy mac was outright amazing.  I can't explain to you how good it was with the chicken -- it didn't even matter that I was in an airport lounge eating out of styrofoam boxes with a plastic fork; I loved it.  I finished up and washed myself down in the men's room before heading over to security, my mouth still sizzling through the entire ordeal, and only started to subside as I was walking down the jetway and boarding my plane.  If it was this good in THIS setting, I imagine that if I had it as the first meal of my vacation in the restaurant, I might not have eaten anything else during my visit.  Don't know when I'll get back ...........but I'm sure going to try.",2014-07-24 17:23:42

First of all this is a place to have FUN! well is it fun when this card dealer name REFEAL who has an accent and acting like a little B*tch! To paying customer who came to have fun? 
my wife and I encountered him while playing Pai gow and saw how he was very rude to a gentleman, wanted to say something for the gentleman, but decided to hop to a different Pai gow table. We sat at a different table and my wife decided to play slot and I stayed at the table playing different type of card games. When hoping to a different table, I found my bro in-law and we decided to play black jack. All was going well untill they switched dealer and we got that b*tch dealer. After not hitting a royal match I lost my bet and decided to gently push my losing chip with my card towards him, then he said I can't do that(in a very rude way) and I asked him why can't I and he wanted me to forfeit my chip on how he wanted me to so we got into an argument and I was swearing and things started to heated up. He said I can't talk to him like that but he can? What a joke, I wasn't going to let this punk talk down to me, so he called the manager and he explained his side and while I explained my side he wanted to interrupt and tells lie but the manager shut him up. She asked me did I swear and I said yes, he was being rude and I'm a paying customer who came to have fun. (The manager saw me at many tables while tracking me and I was playing fine with other dealer and players as well) So I said what's the difference from me gently pushing my chip with my finger and pushing it with my card, the manager knew I wasn't wrong and many players did that and other dealers was ok with it. It was this dealer who was trying to set his own table rules and want customer forfeiting there money in a way he wanted them to. He was causing problem and setting a bad vibe with customer. So I said enough with all this BS and let's play, dealer bust and he pays me, collect my winnings and called him a little B*TCH many time while getting away from the table. Walking out the bathroom and saw my bro in-law and he told me the lady left after I left and he was still talking shit about me to my bro in-law. HOPE THE CASINO MANAGER SEE THIS AND LOOK INTO THIS MATTER, AND THEY NEED TO GET RID OF THIS DEALER ASAP!",2018-03-25 19:34:36
Uq-xRJMGdiCdWePoINU1zA,JgKmBk8ozYLVvwFidhFMrA,NnAfFmqKH3PBeigmuAeFNA,3.0,0,0,0,"I am a Santa Barbara native (although all of my reviews in recent past may be for places in LA, don't let that mislead you) and I tried this place many many years ago but I recently gave it another chance.  My original experience was non-memorable which is probably why in the many years that have past I never had a desire to go back; despite being around the corner from my house.

The girl at checkout after I told her I placed it online (SBMenus) read my order back (always nice to make sure they give you the right order!) and was friendly.

Tonight I got a Tri Tip burrito, light on rice (per a suggestion below), marinated onions and sour cream.  My burrito was pretty darn good.  I am very glad I asked for light on rice because the amount they still put was just about right.  Anymore and I'd be overwhelmed with rice.

I placed my order online w/SBMenus and I arrived under 10 min later and it was ready (there is no time estimate when ordering online so perhaps call and ask time for wait).  My burrito insides were sadly already cold to warm temperature so that was a slight bummer but I think would be avoidable if you eat there or call ask exactly how long.  They were pretty dead tonight so they probably just made it right away and then sat there 8 minutes.

For an $8 burrito this was pretty good.  The tri tip did not seem dry to me (as others say it is on the plates) but also all the goodies in the burrito may help with that.  Their salsas are not impressive and not a large selection; a little watery for my taste.  This place is a little interesting because it offers some Mexican fare but is also a BBQ place mostly but I still desired more salsa selections.  The burrito was a good size (even with light rice) and definitely filled me up.  Most importantly, the burrito was made correctly! Aka the layering went down the side and not stacked so that way as you make your way down the burrito you are not suddenly getting all just one ingredient or another.  I have had this happen elsewhere in my life and it drives me nuts!!!  But thankfully they packed this thing right. Whew.  AND I think this is important, the tortilla...fabulous! It was lightly grilled probably a few seconds so it added some flavor and the tortilla itself was tastey.  So that is another plus.

Will I be back...probably at some point but it isn't my run-go-to place.  Especially considering there are half a dozen other places I can get a burrito within .5 mile from here...But it was a better experience than I remember it being before so that is a definite plus!  

I did enjoy the Tri Tip burrito and the meat was better than the carne asada at some places so I mean in all, ya worth a try but I wouldn't go out of my way for this.

So why 4-stars?  Because I like other similar foods (Mexican variety) more in town but this is still good.   I wish I could actually give a 3.5 but I rounded up because it was so quick and they got all my customization right.  And actually maybe the bomb tortilla actually does warrant a 4 star upgrade.",2013-12-27 05:03:01
0mYPzFNTxGXkt5Mg14r7aw,KJCfCi3RK82haJF_RWOKJA,wrSS3bnu0u1Vh4znhbBXwA,5.0,8,6,12,"I hate to be handin' out five star reviews, but this place ranks up there for two reasons: service, and the mango hookah.

This place popped up out of nowhere it seemed.  We saw it on the way to Juan's, which is across the street from it, and decided to look in and check it out.  It looked cool, with leather couches, tables, TV's--new but tasteful.  More like something from my native city of Orlando, very clean and a big space.  It looked good, so we said we would be back after eating at Juan's.  We ate, got back, and asked if they served drinks, which they do not.  We asked if we could bring beer, and they said YES, so we said we'd be back, walked to Rouses, got a twelve pack, and returned, and finally we were ready to roll.  

They have many flavors of hookah, some of which have funny names like Sex Pologne.  I've tried a couple now, some of them mixed, and some are smoother than others, all were generally good.  Let me add that, I have some experience with hookahs, there are several popular places in Orlando,but not many in New Orleans.  So, this place fills a niche for me, as the only other hookah place I know of is a club in the quarter, which is not really what I want. 

The servers (are they brothers?) are about the most attentive waiters I've had that I can think of off the top of my head.  They keep fresh coals coming, which helps keep the smoking smooth.  They blow and clean out the ashes from time to time.  They'll give you recommendations on flavors (which you should follow).  And they do all this in a laid back, I'll get you anything you need if you just ask manner--not in an annoying, never leave you alone way.  So yeah, they're great.  And they seem young and new at this, so they'll definitely be getting better if they keep up the great attitude.  

Next, the mango hookah.  It's not just mango flavored tobacco (I'm not sure what flavor they use in it).  It is a special hookah you can get that is twice as much as a regular one--$17 or &18 dollars--and it is totally worth it.  It will blow your mind.  It is this:  instead of the normal metal hookah top where they stuff the tobacco, they pit a mango, affix it atop the hookah, stuff the tobacco in that, and cover it.  Then you smoke through the mango, and receive your first whiff of heaven.  It is so smooth.  It tastes so good.  I feel like an idiot in trying to describe it here, it is just that great of an experience.  Stop reading this and go try it right now.  And remember, BYOB.",2011-07-16 23:50:06
IR58vzut5X92tzmK72HwdQ,WhKZfMqXpjJwBVJFwoyDSw,grpNey31cTGKrhmQQaNGdA,3.0,2,0,2,"It was great to see this place open again. First trip back in here was during what I'll call the soft opening period, so this review will hit the positives and also will call out the things the restaurant should work on to meet the expectations of long-time customers.

First, the positives. The bar is still great, and it's made even better now by the new plate glass window that replaces the old glass tiles. It's nice to be able to sit in the bar and look out the window at the world passing by outside. Picons are quite up to par and the bar staff were friendly and fun. The remodel itself is altogether positive. The redone bathrooms are better and the dining room was brightened up and freshened up very nicely.

As far as the menu is concerned, one fun and welcome change to the menu is that while you still get free dessert with your meal (ice cream, and the waitress assured me they're waiting on some cheese to offer as an option) - they also have a dessert menu to choose from. Still plenty of lamb and beef on the menu. The bread was nice, the butter was soft and plentiful (always a plus!) and the salad was a perfect recreation of the salad they had before the place closed. In fact, the salad may be an improvement.

They do need to work out some bugs, however. The beans we were served seemed like they must have come out of a can of barbecue beans. Previously, the place served obviously home-cooked pinto beans with chorizo. There was no beef stew, tongue, or oxtail course. Pork lomo, a dish unique to this kind of restaurant and only on this restaurant's menu in Reno, has been replaced with a Milanese pork, basically a schnitzel. Close, but not a match, the chef should take the time to learn how to make actual lomo. Also, the soup served at the beginning of the meal was always a high point under the previous chef, being a savory mix of lentils, barley, and noodles that always hit the spot. For this meal, we were served a chicken and shaped pasta soup in what I assume was tomato broth, but all the broth had been soaked up by the pasta in the portion we were served. 

Authenticity and home-cooked quality are what makes a restaurant like this shine. Luckily for this restaurant, none of the dishes they used to serve were very complicated recipes. The chef should take a tour through some Basque restaurants to understand what qualities people will be looking for in the food and tweak the menu to meet those standards.",2019-07-19 03:04:19

Long story short, we knew we could afford 1,000$/Mo for rent. Move in date came and really no issues other than they told us we could get the keys the day prior so arriving with a trailer full of our belongings and 3 vehicles and then tell us we can't get the keys until the next morning. Ok? So we stay in a hotel another night, mind you this is after driving for days and already paying for one hotel. We get the keys and the apartment wasn't terrible, but you can tell they are older and the work that is done is half assed. The carpet is super old and after a month or so of living here the old stains from previous tenants started popping up. Other people have complained about roaches and mold, we saw 2 good sized roaches and called for exterminator and they did provide the service and haven't had a problem since. The maintenance, oh lord the maintenance.... when they can keep people they are pretty much on top of it. BUT they can't keep people!! Our first maintenance request went really bad and not because of the work, but because of the maintenance guy. He no longer works here, but he insulted my husband about ""how big"" he is. My husband is not fat by any means, but he is husky. Then the guy started talking shit about the other maintenance guy that was with him. It was super awkward and completely unprofessional. Fast forward a few months and we didn't have any real big issues. The toilet bolt that holds the seat down kept coming loose so we would tighten in until the bolt became stripped, we called and reported the issue, 6 days later!!! And me calling several times and explaining this is somewhat of a safety issue due to the seat moving so much it was like a hover board. I was afraid my husband I would fall right off that sucker, my husband tracked down a maintenance guy in their workshop and he cane over and replaced the bolt. Was literally in and out in 5 minutes but it took 6 days..... and here we are today October 23rd, I called on Sunday and reported our sink wouldn't drain, the garbage disposal is not working and there is standing water in the bottom of our dishwasher. Then the next morning there is water all over the floor and standing water under the refrigerator. I go up to the leasing office and the lady said oh yea we just listened to your message and he will be out there today. Ok! Awesome! 4:15pm and no maintenance man. Mind you, they leave at 6 on the dot. My husband calls the leasing office and she literally tells him ""I forgot to write down your apartment number"" Ummmm hello! I was in the office to sign a new lease! She couldn't remember the apartment number, but I signed a new lease!! She couldn't look at paperwork that was probably still on her desk!!!! They never show. My husband calls early this morning to let them know still no maintenance guy and now more water is on the floor. The sink is completely clogged and will not drain so now I have dishes all over the place! And my OCD is killing me!! I called at 9:05 and the lady said to me yes he will be there sometime today. We have one worker and he is working on the grounds right now. So you're telling me that cleaning up cigarette butts and dog shit is more important that the standing water on my floor!!! 
Oh yes and tenants don't clean up after their pet so don't walk in the grass. 
The pools are nice when they're clean! A month ago the larger one had green slime all in it. They finally cleaned it but it cannot be safe to swim in that!? 
The kids around here are awesome too. One of them decided to bust open the fire extinguisher last week and spray all over the hallway outside. There was white sticky residue all over! Their cleanup effort was to take a leaf blower and clear it out. Almost a week later and we are still tracking in the remnants because it's sticky and they didn't hose it down. 
I'm sure there are some quiet neighbors, but not where we live. People out on their balconies being loud at all times. The lady that lives across the way from us is up every morning around 4am talking on the phone for several hours so load I can hear her entire conversation. 
I'm super pissed that I signed another year here. But the month to month option is stupid expensive especially for this shithole.",2018-10-23 13:57:55
HGLo71Rdr006p_6KdIKXbQ,6MMtpUbxgNfmsPogbec2KA,yqiN-9RQ8yrnVI9IPmYVNw,5.0,1,0,0,"I just stayed two nights at this hotel, and am surprised to find there's only one review so far?!? Very strange. 

The rates are a little higher than what I usually like to pay for a night's stay anywhere, but I think this place is worth every penny. The room and public areas are absolutely spotless and well-maintained. Not only does the lobby contain comfortable chairs to lounge in, but the floors have small, comfortable lounging areas, too. 

The front desk handled the check-in very quickly and professionally. I truly got the sense from every staff member I interacted with that they cared about me, and whether or not I was enjoying my visit. 

The hotel sits right on the southern edge of Lake Pontchartrain, next to the Causeway, and there's currently some major post-Katrina construction going on in the vicinity. So, the closed roads and detours makes it a little tricky to find the front entrance. 

I paid a little extra for valet parking. I was somewhat disappointed to find the valet stand empty so often when I pulled in, or when I walked out the front door to the valet stand to ask for my car (I should have taken the hotel's advice and called the desk ahead of time so that they can get my car ready). Nevertheless, the valet staff were very responsive and courteous. 

I also paid an extra $13/day for in-room Internet service, but was disappointed when I could only get a ""Very poor"" signal from my room.  The speed of the Internet made it pretty much useless.  I suppose the wired connection would have been faster, but I didn't bother with the cables, since I was on a leisure trip and didn't need the Internet to do any work.

The work desk in the room was absolutely perfect. There were ample (4) electrical connectors for your laptop, phone charger, etc., a good lamp, an ethernet (wired) jack,  and inside the desk was an assortment of computer cables, free to use. (Other hotels I've visited might have a computer cable or two available for guests at the front desk, but this hotel has the foresight to provide an assortment of cables right n your desk. No need to trudge downstairs and try to explain to the front desk staff what kind of cable you forgot to pack). 

The room, bathroom, decor... everything was clean, well-maintained, and just perfect. 

To whoever manages this hotel... well done!! If I could be guaranteed this kind of quality when I pay this much for a hotel room, I would upgrade to this class of hotel every time. As it is I had settled for hotels like Hampton Inns and like because, I figured, why pay more for the same level of service. But this hotel raises the bar, and brings back my faith that extra money really does mean extra comfort and service.",2011-03-30 03:18:52

It's got a rock solid low-cost concept that offers a nice selection of food, produce, meats, poultry, dairy, organics and gluten free items.  And sure, you'll most definitely keep more money in your wallet than the other chains so shop with confidence and get to know the ABC's of ALDI.

A.  ALDI cares about our environment which is super cool, so be sure to bring your own bags or plan to buy some of theres.
B.  Speaking of bags, it's your job to bag your own goods but not a deal breaker since it's just adding to our savings.
C.  Be sure to have a quarter in your pocket for a grocery cart.  If you forget, just walk in and get change from someone at a register.  Put it in the slot, free your cart and you'll get it back when you return it.  Btw, they don't have baskets.
D.  Get used to their warehouse-fluorescent look...most items are displayed in the boxes they were delivered in, but hey it's another reason why we're saving!
E.  Leave the coupons behind - they don't take them.
F.  They accept cash, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, most debit cards, EBT and Link cards.  No personal checks or checks/vouchers for WIC.
G.  Get to know their hours.  This location is open every day of the week from 9AM - 9PM.
H.  You're not going to see a huge selection of major/international brands because of their private label items.  So what does that mean?  Simply put, private label products are products stores put their own names on and it's what keeps your wallet from shrinking (think Trader Joes).  But that doesn't mean it compromises the quality of their products.  ALDI meets or exceeds equivalent National Brand items sold in other national retail chains.
I.  Get to know their Double Guarantee Policy.  If you're not 100% satisfied they'll give you a refund and replace the item.
J.  Looking for the nutritional facts?  ALDI displays them on the ""front"" of their products.
K.  They also carry non-food items like toys, household items, tools, outdoor items and more.

Bottom line...ALDI is a unique grocery store striving to offer high quality foods at a lower cost and I commend them for breaking the norm.  I wish them huge success and I hope you'll give them a try too...I know I'll be a regular here!

P.S.  Thanks to the very nice woman who offered her cart on the way out! :)",2016-04-01 22:43:08

This is definitely a company that just wants you to rent from them and then they don't care about their apartments after. We were asked to pay double security deposit, $1600, because we were young and no rental history. I assumed I would walk into a clean apartment if they were being that cautious. When we finally got our apartment after, it was disgusting. It didn't even look like they swept. The fans were never touched, food left in the fridge, the tiles in the bathrooms were coming up, holes all over the walls, blinds caked in dirt, the oven looked like it hadn't ever been cleaned and nothing was painted over. My roommate and I had to clean the entire place. We should have called them, but we knew it would take a week before they answered us.  It was quite the shock that they took $125.00 from our deposit for a ""cleaning crew"" seeing as they clearly don't use it for cleaning. We had to cover all the holes in the walls, which we made zero. We painted over every hole. We fixed every problem from previous renters. We left it sparkling just so they had no choice but to give us our deposit. This place is sketchy and we knew they would try and take all the money they could. Please make sure to take pictures of EVERYTHING. Our building also didn't have hallway lights for 3 months. We had to walk up to the third story in pitch black every night. We emailed them about it. It was fixed for a could of days and then went out again. It's clearly a electric issue that they won't fix. Dont expect to get a response from them within a week of emailing. Their lease is 16 pages long, basically stating that you're responsible for fixing anything. They never once cleaned our lobby. It's clear they just rent their apartments and never look back at them. They actually want raised the rent after we moved. I don't know how they want to raise rent in a building where there's no hallway lights.... They send us text about them showing our rental still. We haven't rented from them in two months and they still send reminders. I had to block the number because it automatedI'm currently renting from Helix properties and now I see what a landlord should actually be like. They are amazing and so helpful. They are unprofessional. Dave just stands there on his phone while you look at the place. If landlords don't care enough to walk around with you, that should be a clear sign to walk away.

Let me start from the beginning...we are selling our house so of course the buyers want a termite inspection as expected so earlier this week a PEST control company came out (I will not name the company) but the rep showed up in dress slacks and a button down shirt that caught my attention first because how in the world was this guy who looked all of 18 in his nicest attire gonna get in the mulch and in the crawl space and do a thorough check?! Then he goes into my garage and stands in the middle of the floor and is writing things on his clipboard while not moving around. I stood and watched him and even asked ""can I move anything for you? Is anything in your way?"" He says ""no we just pretty much look around."" Then he goes to the crawl space a very short time later he comes out and decided to tell me that he is done and he found old termite damage but nothing live. Well I'm shocked to hear this and in complete disbelief because we had the house checked when we purchased 4 years ago and twice since (the two times since were because it was included in our PEST protection contract we were in with Terminix last year) and we have NEVER been told there was previous damage and we have NEVER had to treat for termites. He says ""I don't recommend treatment but I'll send my report to the buyer"". So of course the buyer now wants treatment done which is totally understandable but we did not believe his report but instead of taking the chance of losing a buyer we decided that we would seek treatment but NOT with that company so I did a little research and came across this company which is highly recommended through reviews. I called and explained the situation to the man who answered Roger who come to find out is the owner and told him I wanted an estimate for treatment...he insisted on sending his guys out right away for a second opinion and explained how and why these things happen with bigger companies. Fast forward a few hours two men come to my house very nice and very knowledgeable! They looked my house over twice including the crawl space and even took the picture of the graph from the other company with him to double check those ""problem areas"" and found absolutely nothing! These guys were gaining nothing from me today and could have lied to me just like the other company did ONLY to rip me off of several hundred dollars but the did not! What a great business Rodger is running and whether or not the buyer still wants treatment  (which would only be done by Angell) they just gained a lifetime client and believe me when I tell you I will recommend this company to any and EVERYONE because honesty and quality are very hard to find and these guys have it!",2017-03-16 20:42:31

After 45 minutes I called the store, and spoke with Jason, who was SO nice and helpful - he searched and searched and found no order for me. He then put his (I assumed) manager on who told me there was no order for me.  I replied that was fine - no biggie, shit happens, yadda yadda, just refund the charge and I'll make some ramen and call it a day.

""Nope"" said Mr. Manager. ""You need to take that up with your bank.""

I'm seriously so effing sick of businesses using that line as if it absolves them of all responsibility while maintaining brilliant customer service, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T.

Trust me on this, I spent most of my working life in the service industry and I know that it's a far far far far far better thing to lose $22 worth of product by offering a comp to a LOYAL customer (who PAID whether you ever see the money or not) than to lose that LOYAL customer forever, and any or all LOYAL customers who read her yelp review and think she's a) right on the money, or b) really effing hilarious thus worth supporting by boycotting said business in protest.

I still love me some Domino's Pizza, but I've placed my last order (whether or not Mr. Manager believes the order was placed) but I will never give THIS Domino's location: 
STORE 7402 
1675 ROBB DRIVE
RENO NEVADA 89523
any more of my business.

Oh and I have one last note/gripe:
Imagine that this situation were reversed, and I had received a pizza, but my payment did not go through. 

Would Mr. Manager accept the ""call your bank"" excuse?

Discuss.

I'll be over here enjoying my hot fresh Pizza Hut Pizza.

During my initial consultation, I asked Dr. Kreithen what my options are for getting my sagging breasts to the 34D cup size I enjoyed pre-motherhood.  He said at that cup size, he can make it look perfect without even making the horizontal scar down my breast.  That sounded great and I was excited about the procedure and followed all the pre- and post- op instructions to the letter.  Imagine my surprise when none of the D-cup bras fit me and measurements revealed that I am now 34DDD!  I never wanted boobs so huge and would never have agreed to this.  Additionally, it turns out finding good-looking bras, swim suits and clothes in general at this cup size is a real challenge.  But believe it or not, this is far from my biggest concern or complaint.

The implants keep flipping over inside my breast in the most unpleasant fashion and flipping them back is a kind of torture.  First time it happened, Dr. Kreithen called me into the office, manipulated my breast awhile to flip it and said it was unusual and shouldn't happen again. Right!   They kept flipping every time I would lie on my side or bend over.  After making me wait for months, Dr. Kreithen then did a corrective procedure, cutting off some skin around the nipple to tighten it and prevent flipping.  The procedure was almost as invasive as the first and recovery as painful, and it did not help in the slightest.  When I complained again after this botched revision, the nurse implied in her responses that it's all my fault but did offer another revision: Dr. Kreithen was offering to reduce the cup size of the implant to what I originally requested and tighten some skin again.  I don't see how that would have helped with the flipping and no satisfactory explanation was provided, but that's a moot point now: there is no chance I would agree to undergo another torture at the hands of Dr. Kreithen, so I declined the offer and asked for my money back.  At that point, Dr. Kreithen's office stopped responding to my calls and emails.

I have more: 1) He placed the implants above the muscle creating far less natural and appealing look with skin easily folding around the implant, 2) He made my areolas look crooked and uneven, 3) after first procedure, my nipples were visibly pointing in different directions, with one much further left of center then the other, and it's still off after the revision, 3) the waits in Dr. Kreithen's office are torturously long and his staff is rude.

Do yourself a favor and find another doctor - Dr. Kreithen sucks!",2021-06-07 16:19:36
bpEs93oQQ1PWDMfSVMZQQg,v8v20odlEnoGEhnbAtJ0qw,LSwjLzdrksnjI6DrjsMV9g,5.0,9,0,1,"Last weekend, having been raving about it to my family for the past week, we took a group of 9 people to try the dinner menu at Nina's Cucina just off Spring Hill Dr on Kass Circle. This quaint little Italian restaurant had come to my attention via some postings on Facebook and had led me to try lunch there whilst out one day. Suitably impressed I returned for dinner with my wife and having enjoyed that we decided it was time to introduce it to other people.

We had a reservation for 8 o'clock and when we arrived (about 10 minutes late) the last few tables were finishing up. This doesn't bother me (and the time before when I went it was jam packed at 8.30 so reservations are recommended on the weekend). It's not much to look at from the outside but they have a couple of tables and chairs outside to sit at and I can imagine that it would be nice to do so when it isn't too hot. As you go inside you are sure to be surprised as there is a very warm feel to it. There is a fake brick façade, warm colors and a very nice bar area. It is nicely decorated and there is Sinatra or Bennett playing in the background - good start.

Nina's Cucina has a 2 for $20 dinner menu where you both get an appetizer/salad, entrée and dessert for $20. Great value and the portion sizes are right. There are 4 apps, about 12 entrees and 3 desserts to choose. I have had the Bruscetta and salad (Caesar) at this point but everyone said theirs was good. There are a few dressing options on the house salad. All in all, solid start on the food.

I should also mention that Nina's Cucina allows you to take your own bottles. They do serve alcohol but for $4 they will uncork your wine ($2 for beer) and allow you to bring a bottle (bottles in our case) of your choice. A really nice option to help keep your cost down.

The entrees were VERY well received by the whole table. I had spaghetti and meatballs but everything from the shrimp in cream sauce to chicken masala to the carbonara with chicken was put away with barely a scrap left between us all. Everything is made fresh to order and so you can change things up a little, add some chicken or shrimp etc. The staff is very friendly and nothing seems too much for them.

It has a very good flavor profile in the food, you can taste everything that is in there and it is there in the right amounts. Sometimes sauces in Italian restaurants are too sweet, too creamy or too oily. That is not the case here. I was suitably impressed and I am a bit of an Italian food snob.

The desserts were brought out (I don't eat dessert except for very rare circumstances) and we tried a bit of everything. The tiramisu got the highest marks from the table with only the chocolate mousse receiving anything less than an excellent rating. Not a big concern for me or for anyone else though.

In a time where it seems all of the major chain restaurants are doing a 2 for 1 deal or 2 for $20 it seems that locally owned places are sometimes trying to do too much to catch up. However, when you can match them on price and put out a far superior product then you are onto a winner. Barely anyone that I speak to knows about Nina's Cucina (something that I am determined to change) and yet it is head and shoulders above many of the places that I have eaten at over the past 18 months. Nina's Cucina in Spring Hill is a great little hole in the wall place that is good for family dinners, romantic dinners or parties. If you get a chance then I encourage you to try it out - that way you can say ""I went there when it was still in that old building"" as it is sure to gain popularity once people catch on.",2012-05-11 13:05:23
bZdLEg94IzPNOYZyPjRVxQ,lTrL5uKvsIfIDTslYMenvA,SpeR_7Gf3OLEWAHK4p3bMg,1.0,0,0,0,"Without doubt Pima Heart is the poorest run medical practice I've ever had the misfortune to experience. I realize there are many medical practitioners here, including docs, PAs, techs, MAs, etc., so you'd expect several front office people working there.  However, Pima Heart has far too many such employees, so many that no one really does much work at all. In other words, their work efficiency is minimal.

I had two procedures (a bubble echo and a heart monitor attached) and one office visit with Dr. Koshkarian.  Both procedures were negative reflections on this practice. Before the echo I called to make sure if there was or wasn't a prep protocol I needed to follow. I called to make sure but had no luck getting through to anyone.  Finally after several calls, I did get through to their call center--yes, ""call center""; they appear to not answer their own phones. The call center voice gave me the number of my doc's MA, so I ended up calling and leaving a voicemail asking about the prep protocol.  She never called me back.

When I went in for the bubble echo, the room was very warm, stuffy, and quite small. The trash bin was overflowing with dirty towels. There was Mexican music blaring on the tech's computer, the kind you'd hear in a Mexican restaurant. After enduring two very painful bungled attempts, I realized he was not capable of doing the IV stick, and I told him so.  He left to get someone who could. A woman came in from ""another office"" and did the stick painlessly and easily on the first attempt.

Other things I noticed was that the tech appeared not to be ready for our procedure; he kept leaving the room to get things and mumbling to himself. At the end of the procedure, when it was time for the injection of an air bubble into my heart, he left and returned with a young woman who, apparently, knew nothing about this procedure. He kept telling her what to do and encouraging her to continue. All the while I'm lying there thinking ""OK, this woman is going to inject something into my heart and she doesn't know what the hell she's doing. I wonder if I'll live through this.""

A few days after this ordeal, I received a text asking for my feedback. I said pretty  much what I've written here. But I included my name and phone number, and asked for a call back.  Naturally, that call has not come. I'm certain no one bothered to read that feedback, certainly no one is a position of responsibility.

There are plenty of cardiologists in Tucson. I suggest you avoid Pima Heart because, frankly, they couldn't care less about a patient's welfare or health.",2020-07-18 20:12:11
dtUZKg0-76iFK2LjvC678Q,yj_Foz5GlXNoAyeHndr1cw,FA9GjPz9T8UAbLSEDERj7w,2.0,12,9,5,"Stopped in with a girlfriend this past Saturday for the official first mani/pedi of the season. 

Let's cut right to the chase: NO awesome back massaging chairs. 
I love those chairs, I'd pay the $30 just to sit in the chair and read a magazine for an hour. I've tried to replicate the experience at home with any number of off the rack back massaging pads, they've all been found wanting. 

So right off the bat, I'm wary. 

My fears are not exactly assuaged by the fact that the owner/manager is a forceful presence. He orders: ""WELCOME, please sign in. "" Then he resumes his Romanesque half-recline on the front waiting section sofa. 

He's scary and we don't want to snuggle, so my girlfriend and I scurry off to the safety of pedicure section in the back. There, I'm soothed by the better than average decor, the fact that they have a nice selection of dark polish (I do love a nice asphalt with red glitter) and the promise of something to do with hot stones. 

I'm just getting settled in to a nice hot foot bath, when the owner barks something at the girl giving my pedi. She jumps, I jump... all the other women jump. I almost drop People magazine on my poor tech's head. (All about Pippa!) Not super relaxing. This happens about once every 10 minutes to either my tech or another tech. I'm thinking: ""Who is this guy? "" 

Pedi was awesome. Hot stones are the best. Toes are beautiful and on to the mani. 

Apparently my tech picked the wrong station. Another reproving word from the head honcho and I'm forced to shuffle to another table (in a near empty salon) with one of those cotton thingies between my toes. 

Mani looked great, and during dry time, they give a nice shoulder massage with another hot stone. All the while, the manager was sitting up at the front register glowering at his staff; and interjecting sharp comments from time to time. I was expecting him to whip out a kettle drum and command each woman to file in sync. 

In sum, the services are great. The salon is impeccably clean and I would absolutely go back for the hot stones; forgiving even the lack of fancy chairs. But what's with the manager? His presence was an uncomfortable addition.  I couldn't relax, and that's what I go for.  So I'm not sure I'll be returning.",2011-06-06 14:32:41

I missed my flight because 65 was closed due to a bad accident and was stuck in Indianapolis for the night.  United gave me a distressed passenger voucher for a hotel (discounted night for people who get stuck) and the Comfort Inn was one of the hotels on the list.  Unfortunately they didn't have any rooms left at that price but the price I got was only $10 more expensive (for a grand total of $70).
Apparently their shuttle had been involved in an accident recently (sideswiped by another driver) so instead of telling me I had to take a cab they sent a town-car!  I was amazed!  The hotel is not super close to the airport so it took some time for the driver to get there.   The driver was very sweet and informed me of places I could eat dinner in the area. 
When I arrived Erica at the front desk checked me in and was very accommodating.  After I arrived in the room she couldn't remember if I wanted a wake up call for my 6am flight or not so called me before I was asleep.  (Which I very much appreciated!)
Then through a turn of events, my mother also got stuck in Indianapolis and would be joining me.  I went down to the front desk and informed Erica, and she was very accommodating and we called the town-car to pick her up from the airport.   When my mother arrived she was unsure if she needed an early shuttle to the airport or not (she works for the airlines, so she can take several flights) so she told the front desk she would keep them updated.  
The room smelled a little strange (as most Comfort Inns do) but the smell went away with the very loud Air Conditioning.  The bathroom fan was equally as loud.  The room was clean and comfortable otherwise. 
Neither my mother or I would be at the hotel during the free continental breakfast.  But Erica was so sweet that she packed breakfasts (i.e. bagel or muffin and a piece of fruit) for not just me but EVERY hotel guest that was leaving before 6am!  I haven't seen service this good in some 5 star hotels!  To top it all off, when the van to the airport was full they ordered taxis and paid for them!  

Overall?  
Room was okay, about what I would expect from a Comfort Inn - 2/5 
Service was phenomenal!  Hands down the best service in a Comfort Inn. Ever. 5/5
All things considered? 3.5/5 and I round up, so they got 4/5

I would certainly recommend the hotel for an Indy layover.",2009-08-07 17:24:56
H1r6qNvl4dhT8qg98ow5hg,hKPmZecix4D7D5TFxcaM3Q,PVbkPTLHeAZfCp-nUTS-Ew,1.0,4,1,0,"Outcome: Paper thin nails, bruises and no polish.

Where do I even begin with this salon??? My entire experience with them has been nothing but an absolute and unnecessary nightmare... this is not an exaggeration either. 

I have gone to this salon before, 2/13/2019 was my third chance with them. I have never left fully happy with the services I was provided in previous appointments with them however I was desperate to have my nails done for Valentine's Day and they were the only salon to have availability (which was a red flag-which I ignored, unfortunately.) 
My friend and I walked in for my appointment and were immediately rushed to pick colors. After going back and forth with my friend on what colors to pick (as my original preference for colors were not available - 3000 colors and no gray) we finally decided on a smoky purple and shimmering pink--mind you the entire time the owner of the salon was hovering over us making it very uncomfortable to pick any color. I had pictures of the design I wanted to have done and showed them the exact look I was going for. We were all in agreement and proceeded to the pedicure chair. This is where it all started to go downhill.

I believe his name is Tito. He rushed the process and didnt complete the job. The bottoms of my feet were barely touched and remain extremely rough, he butchered my toes creating uneven and rough splintered edges, did not address the cuticles, he applied the polish in such a half hazard manner creating lots of bubbles and there was no cleanup. He was EXTREMELY rough to the point that I have bruises all down my legs. I mentioned multiple times to him that he missed a spot or that he was being too rough. He just ignored me and carried on as if he was doing a satisfactory job. 

We then began my shellac manicure which was even worse than the pedicure. By this time my friend was noticing how badly he was doing my nails and started telling him that the edges and shape of my nails were all different and that he needed to reshape them and cut them to be the right length. He clearly was perturbed that he had to take another customer before they closed. Mind you they close at 7 and we arrived at 5:30pm. He had an attitude the entire time and you could tell he absolutely did not want to be there and it was clearly reflecting in his work.  My friend also told him that the polish he was using on my nails was very different than the one on my toes, this was an issue because when we were picking colors I was adamant about matching my toes, and they assured me the colors were the same. There is a distinct shade difference, which to some wouldn't be an issue, however, when you pick a shimmering pink and get a hot bubble gum pink that is way too noticeable to ignore. They never once stopped to check and make sure that they picked the correct color for my hand, and he proceeded with the manicure. After, once again, rushing the entire process he let someone else do the design I requested. The design was simple, descending dots, truly an extremely simple design, AND they somehow managed to mess that up too. They didn't put the clear coat over the nails that received the design and the polish on my hands was very clearly uneven. My nails just looked horrid. 

At this point they were saying they were done with the services. That is when my friend walked up to the front to speak with the owner because my nails looked worse than when I went in. She told them they needed to fix the nails and that this was unacceptable. So then four people came to look at my nails to tell me that they were fine and they just applied some more polish to ""satisfy"" me. Later that evening my shellac polish already started chipping. I called them as soon as they opened the next day to tell them and show them how poorly my nails were done and that they should not be chipping in less than 12 hours. They kept going back and forth with me claiming that ""we never told them there was a problem"" while we were there, however, we told them MULTIPLE times. I just told them I wanted to come in and have them remove everything and give me a refund. This was absolutely the WORST nail experience that I have ever had. They said that I could come in and they would ""fix"" it. At this point my nails are so short and jagged from Tito's ""amazing"" work that there was NOTHING to be fixed. I told them that I was not going to them for a fourth time to try and do what they should have done correctly the first time. They kept arguing with me that it wasn't ""fair to their company"" to give me a refund. I literally told them that if I were trying to get something for free why would I demand that they take off the ""work"" they did? 

I want it to be clear... I am not trying to get anything for ""free"" or be some entitled person leaving reviews on social media platforms, I am just warning others about my experience and letting you decide if you want to visit this establishment.",2019-02-15 14:37:12

Anything pickled will leave me tickled...hey, that rhymed. But it's a misnomer. You're not just limited to three pickles. In fact, you can eat as many pickles as your sour heart desires because there's a whole trough of help-yourself pickles! Not only that, but they carry dill pickle flavored potato chips!! Could you just die?!?

The ambiance reminds me of those lovely delis my dear grandmother, Hazel, would take me to as a little girl in Brooklyn. With its high ceilings and exposed brick, I feel like I'm home again. But unlike the delis in Brooklyn, the employees at The Three Pickles don't shout at you if you're holding up the line because you're being indecisive. The staff at The Three Pickles are gentle, kind and patient. Which really warms my cold heart. 

Even better is they carry a nice selection of wine and beer on tap (are you listening Sojourner? ON TAP!), so you can get a little tipsy at lunch which makes it so much easier to deal with your horrible womanizing boss after you head back to work. There's also a lovely patio seating area which is shared with the also very lovely people at Handlebar Coffee next door (by the way, try their mochas...delicious). I always love the option of sitting indoors or outdoors depending on the level of humidity in the air. I have very temperamental hair.

Now, if there's one thing I like more than Cuban men, it's a Cuban sandwich! If you want a good Cuban (sandwich, that is), then march your doughy face over to The Three Pickles for one of the best Cuban sandwiches this side of Miami. And even though it's now legal for me to travel to Cuba, I don't feel the urgency since I can just get my fill of their delicious sandwiches right here in Santa Barbara. If you're looking for a Cuban man, however, you're probably better off going to Cuba. Not a great selection here on the West coast, unfortunately for me.

One wouldn't normally call me a lucky person--especially if you've met my ex-husband--but it just so happened that the last time I was eating at The Three Pickles there was a Mexican wedding taking place across the street at the Presidio. Well, there are few things better than nibbling a Cuban sandwich while a Mariachi band plays ""Mi Linda Esposa!"" from across the street. I'm a lucky gal indeed.",2015-02-01 22:01:07

This is rumored to be the number 1 place for fried chicken in the country, so a friend urged me to hit it up while I was in town. Although, initially I had no plans to visit. My only knowledge about it was from the ""Somebody Feed Phil"" series, and the host seemed to be highly impressed. So I thought  - ""might as well"".

Once we arrived, found a line wrapping around the building, but we had traveled quite a way so there was no turning back. Wait time took about an hour and a half before we actually got a seat. Mind you, this was all in the hot and humid conditions during the middle of the day, with little to no shade available. We ordered as quick as we possibly could have, given a menu was placed outside so that customers could be ready to order when seated. Immediately, we sensed a bothered demeanor from our server, but we tried not to let it affect us. The patience was very short lived but we remained composed, of course.

Moving on to what we ordered. 
I got the 3 piece white meat fried chicken special with a side of butter beans and rice. Also, a tiny side of macaroni & cheese and mashed potatoes were ordered - they were pretty bland. And to be honest, they were miniature plates for the price of what could be a full meal at some fast food joints. Not worth it considering the approach seems to be one of homestyle service, which usually means larger portions. 
So how was it? The chicken was great, actually got better with every bite. They use wet better instead of dry, resulting in a different crunch. The mixture of seasonings give it an excellent flavor. For not being a fried chicken aficionado, I would easily rate it a four of five stars for overall taste and texture. 

Sadly, the service affected the experience greatly. Pondered the idea of giving two stars but the chicken was actually good, and I just couldn't bring myself to do it. We were always met with an annoyed look at any request. Never even got a bottle of hot sauce we requested, which was disappointing because I felt that would have made the chicken taste even better. Ultimately, Willie Mae's never matched the hype for me. Prices weren't too affordable and I could have absolutely done without the uninterested service - especially after waiting for so long in unwavering heat to enjoy a decent meal.",2018-09-27 07:08:05

I've always thought it was a ""rich-person"" thing, and that it was out of my price-range. It turns out that MoveGreen wasn't super expensive (under $300 for a 2 hour move), and they saved me so much time, hassle, and headache/backache. 

My move was a small one- I was moving from a studio into a 1-bedroom apartment on the same street. In terms of preparation, I packed and labeled everything myself. I used these Avery Removable Moving Labels that had 1 large sticker with the room name and contents, then 4 smaller stickers with the room name for each corner of the box. I also placed signs in my new apartment indicating where I wanted everything placed (ie. ""couch/bed/etc. here"" with a downward arrow) and had a furniture placement guide taped to the front door indicating which furniture goes into which room. This was probably unnecessary, but I like to prepare as much as possible. I am an anxious little critter and get nervous easily.

Getting an estimate for the move was easy- Erik showed up about 5-10 minutes early, looked around my studio, and emailed me the estimate soon after leaving. I think he also used an iPad, Mr. Fancy Pants. I booked the move later over the phone, and was told that I would receive a confirmation phone call the day prior to the move...which I never received. The lack of a confirmation phone call set off my neurotic mind, and I worried that the movers would never show up and I would have to scramble at the last minute.

Thankfully, the movers showed up the next day. They were 10 minutes early (God, I love when people are early). Raul and LG introduced themselves to me then got to work!! It was the coolest thing to just sit on my rump, playing games on my phone, while a couple dudes did all the heavy lifting and moving. This is the life, right?

Raul in particular was very friendly, enjoying chatting with me, and busted his butt. He went into beast-mode once we arrived at my new apartment. I would hire him again in a heartbeat. LG was good enough, but smelled like cigarette smoke which I didn't like. They both really appreciated the cold bottled water and soda's which I had saved for them at both apartments. I tipped them and they were also appreciative of it. 

Anyways- if you can save your pennies up, hire these movers. They are friendly, efficient, work hard, save you time and the headache of moving yourself...and they're eco-friendly to boot!",2014-08-25 16:19:27

I was beside myself and even showed them my receipt where I paid for the other bag not too long ago and I would of checked it it there as this would of made more sense. She understood what I was saying and went to call a supervisor.

When my friend wanted to pop into Second Vine I was compliant.......but not excited.  When we entered we were greeted at the door. It was a warm and welcoming greeting.  I became hopeful.  The staff explained that they were readying for a private party...but they were still helpful and chatting with us.  They began discussing wines with my friend and I drifted around the store, when suddenly someone asked me about my taste in wine.  I thought that this was going to be the inevitable moment when I would be publicly embarassed again.  Much to my surprise, the response was quite the contrary.  I explained that I had no palate and the owner and his son set out immediately to prove me wrong.  When I said that I only like really sweet wines they explained that I am not an unusual beginner and brought out a wine for me to taste.  I loved it.  They went on to teach me about the wine and made a plan for me to return and enjoy more dessert wines until I am ready to taste fruity wines and so forth until I have an educated palate.  Another staff memeber taught me a couple new vocabulary words for my new wine interest.  He did it in a way that was not condescending, but rather like a friend sharing a new tidbit of news.  All this time the staff was still working to have the private party.  At no time did we feel as though we were under foot.  My friend purchased her wine........she explained that it was a very good price and she could not pass it up.  When we wanted to leave we were escorted to the door in a leisurly manner and said good-bye to everyone with whom we chatted while we were there.  It was a fantastic experience.  I can't wait to return.  I am so excited!!!  Oh yes, AND I have a favorite wine to ask for.  There are events to make it convenient to return....I am all in!!!",2015-04-12 16:11:52

I ordered a pizza and wings online, when I went to pick it up the box was so hot it scalded my hands, I got home and realized the wings were burnt to the pan and hot sauce was leaking through!? I called up to the resturant thinking one of the kids might've been goofy enough to microwave the tin foil pan or something and the manager answered, promptly told me that there's no way they did that and then hung up on me! I called back and spoke to another young man who claimed to be the manager and he told me that I was welcome to bring my order back up but there was no way they had done that. I went back up there less than ten minutes later to find them both at the register waiting on me. They asked me for a receipt, I had ordered online and wasn't given one when I picked up my order. I asked them if I could just show them my confirmation on my phone and they said no and there was no way to look up online orders? I told them I had ordered on my phone and could show them the confirmation but they still refused to even look at it and this was the same kid who gave me my order! I was angry and asked to speak to the store manager or owner, they told me that they didn't have to give me that information. I asked if they were a franchise or corporate owned and they again rudely told me that they didn't have to give me that information. The kid that had served me shoved the tray of hot wings across the counter at me after we went back and forth arguing. I eventually got their names and as I was about to leave one of the kids in the back ran up to the counter screaming you can have my name laughing. I was so angry my hands were shaking, I've never in my life been treated like that. I filed a complaint online and the owner called me about it, he defended his staff saying that ""if they fixed every messed up order that came back there would be nothing left for anyone""? He even sent me a video of my interaction with his staff that he had carefully edited to leave out the kid at the end running up to the counter and them hanging up on me etc.?! I was appalled and after arguing with him about how he could think my treatment was ok and getting nowhere I understood why his staff acted the way they did, it's apparently commonplace there!

6S_ybhVpROhttjRGw5QOUA,srfHdvOxBje88feqzKhO2w,26zmibddKEy1JMOZXU4Wjw,1.0,9,0,0,"I recently had a very disagreeable visit to the pharmacy at the Walgreen's in northwest Reno that I need to share.

Yesterday I had an appointment with my surgeon for a post-operative exam. As a result of some things he found, I was given a prescription for an antibiotic and also a pain medication. At about 5:00 he sent the script for the antibiotic electronically but I needed to hand-carry the one for the pain med. 

Arriving at Walgreen's around 5:30, I presented them with the pain script, but told them I didn't need it right away and that I would pick it up the following day. However, (because I had an abscess and was running a fever) I told them I needed the antibiotic and would wait for it. They confirmed receipt of the prescription and said it would be twenty minutes, during which time I could browse in the store. They would page me as soon as my prescription was ready.

I browsed around the store, went out to my car, made a few phone calls. Finally, I returned to the pharmacy waiting area and did some texting.

A pharmacy clerk asked if I was waiting for a prescription and I said yes. She asked me my name and date of birth and promptly disappeared. A few minutes later I was asked the same questions by a different clerk. Looking at my watch I was surprised to realize I had been waiting over an hour.

This clerk checked with the pharmacist and said, ""The pharmacist didn't know you were waiting for the prescription. She thought you said you wanted to pick it up tomorrow. At that point, I needed to clarify which prescription they were filling. I explained that there were two new prescriptions in my name. ""You ARE filling the one for the antibiotic, aren't you?"" The clerk looked it up in their computer. ""Yes, it's for.."" and read me the components for my pain med. 

So at that point I realized I had just waited over an hour for a prescription that Walgreen's was not even filling. In addition, I was shocked that the pharmacy clerk couldn't tell the difference between an antibiotic and a narcotic. 

Irritated, I explained again it was the antibiotic I wanted and the clerk went to speak with the pharmacist again. When she returned, she said they had only JUST received the transmitted prescription (the same one that an hour before another clerk verified they had received) and that it would be about twenty minutes.   

Based on this pitiful performance, I'm going to transfer my prescriptions out of Walgreen's. Anyone thinking of going to this location for prescriptions should be forewarned!",2015-03-20 02:09:38
dqCBpVhB20Mfoy6-3AtSRg,fhi8K-yYlcCpWt2MRBYPgA,4q2WFzo7z0jBjwUd08mWjQ,5.0,14,0,2,"I had no idea I would love this place so much.  It was such an experience.  I was in the area alone on business and had a perfectly fine time with no one in tow.  I highly recommend getting some background by visiting the museum. I learned so much about what to expect and was able to identify so much on the walk. The museum was put together very well.  Even the video was entertaining and all the recreations and artifacts.  I also grabbed a free map, which is a must.  Wear comfy shoes. This will take more time than you think!  In all I spent at least two hours there. 

The 2,200-acre site included 120 human-built earthwork mounds over an area of six square miles, of which 80 remain. Cahokia Mounds is the largest archaeological site related to the Mississippian culture, which developed advanced societies in the central and eastern present-day United States, beginning more than five centuries before the arrival of Europeans.  It is the largest prehistoric earthen construction in the Americas north of Mexico.

The people who lived amongst Cahokia were called the Mississippian culture and it spread all over the area. Cahokia was the center of it all, the big city, if you will, and this is what it looked like.

The chief lived here among the highest mound, Monks Mound. Ceremonial buildings and the homes of the elite stood on top of the many platform mounds. There were many ceremonial and trade connections to other Mississippian sites throughout the Midwest and Southeast.

Historic accounts in diaries and drawings were recorded during the De Soto exploration, summarized by Garcilaso De Le Vega in 1539-1543. Among other accounts from watercolor artist John White in 1565, and Jean-Bernard Bossu, Marquette, Jolliet and other French explores in the 1700s.

Initial occupation during Late Woodland times (AD 700-800) included small settlements along Cahokia Creek. Population increased, peaking between AD 1050-1150 at 10-20,000. A decline in population began in the 1200s and by AD 1350-1400, Cahokia had been abandoned.

Cahokia was considered the large city or front line community. There were also suburbs or second line communities, that had there own mounds, plazas and residential areas. Four second line communities have been identified near Cahokia, including East St. Louis (45 mounds), St. Louis (26 mounds), Mitchell (11 mounds) and Pulcher (10 mounds). These communities had populations in the thousands and served as a political and ceremonial center for third and fourth line communities. It was subordinate to Cahokia. 

Third line communities were usually villages located along lakes and streams with a population of several hundred. They were administrative and ritual centers for the smaller fourth line communities and had maybe one or two mounds. 

Fourth line communities were very small, maybe one house by a farm field or just a few families living in a few houses. Surplus crops from these villages went to the larger communities.

The inhabitants left no written records beyond symbols on pottery, shell, copper, wood and stone, but the elaborately planned community, woodhenge, mounds and burials reveal a complex and sophisticated society. The city's original name is unknown.

Some of the mounds have been excavated and trinkets, such as this, were found. As well as the remains of hundreds of people. The people of Cahokia traded food for services and trinkets and traveled great distances to communities around the country similar to their own.

There are three distinct mound shapes, including platform, ridgetop and conical. The use and contents of the mounds are based on the shape. 

On my high of the mounds, two that I saw were called the Twin Mounds because they are right by each other. One of them is a platform mound called ""Fox Mound."" It has not been excavated but is thought to have been the site of a charnel house where important people were prepared for burial in the adjacent Roundtop Mound. It is one of the largest and highest platform mounds at Cahokia.

After learning all this in the museum, it was time for my hike. I saw a lot and at the end was Monks Mound. Monks Mound is the largest prehistoric earthwork in the Americas. Its base covers over 14 acres and it's 100 feet high. It contains an estimated 22 million cubic feet of earth, all hand-carried in baskets! I was very proud of myself for making the climb! That's a must do. You can see the arch from up there!",2013-09-05 03:12:30

If you are a high school student looking for a cheap tux for your prom , get after it. If it's your wedding day-stay clear. There were too many issues with this place to list, but I will try:

1. It took 6 months to get an order of pocket squares in, when they finally came in the order was short by one. Instead of ordering more, they cut one square in two, did not share this with me and charged us full price and handed the items over in a bag and ushered me out of the store so that I did not have time to check my order. When I came back to the store, the ?manager? was surprised that I was so bothered by this-three days before my wedding, because despite stopping in the week before, leaving my phone number (as well as already having the phone numbers of each order placed) and calling they weren't sure how to get in touch with me . Give me a break. Finally as I had to stand over the manager she called in a new order and magically new (though slightly different colors) pocket squares appeared.

2. Of the eight tuxedos ordered, two were correct when it came to sizing and what was included in the package. One groomsman was asked where he was fitted as his sizes were ""totally wrong"". Ummmm AT THIS STORE. The special tailoring they promised took over an hour for some of the groomsman and this was mainly due to the fact that incorrect sizes had been ordered (again they were all measured at this location).  It was also discovered that  HALF of the orders had TIES and the other half had BOW TIES (bow ties is what we ordered). 

3. When leaving the store one person paid for his son's tux as well as his own. When his son went to leave he was accosted by a salesperson that he must pay for his tux. When he said it was already paid for, they gave him a hard time. 

4. Though selecting a high end brand for tuxedos (the cost was $200 per tux with a slight discount even), while standing in line to head into the reception to be announced a button fell off one of the groomsmen's jackets. It was not buttoned, he was not moving simply standing and speaking to someone and plop there it was on the ground. Thank goodness for the sewing skills of someone at our venue.

Bottom line, the woman working there is sweet but that does not make up for the horrible service and stress days before the most important day of your life.",2013-06-11 13:58:46
5L6utEqfi9w1XzGvVSPaQg,xH4wtMFdd4bqAlkq3whijg,UeYZgcORV2Veo_BZzdiaTg,3.0,2,0,0,"On my last day in the French Quarter, I specifically came here because the place had caught my eye with its peeling paint and old school' I am historic' charm. I looked the place up on Yelp and I saw all the red stars...and that it had the best muffaletta in town. I wanted to try it. 

Firstly, I didn't get a good vibe from the front of house. She offered me the bar, but I am not a sit-at-the-bar-alone kinda of gal, so I asked for a table. I got a table for 2 next to a work station...not my favorite location considering there were other tables for two in the room, but I was still glad to be there. Sorry I was solo but my money is still good, gurl.

I LOVED my waiter. He was personable, funny, entertaining...and insightful about people. He was fast, efficient and took the time to get to know his customers, not just me, everybody. He's a great ambassador for the restaurant, and the city. Initial impression -- awesome waiter!

I was to miss out on their specialty -- the Italian Muffaletta -- because I had it at the Bourbon House last night. The muffaletta is a huge ginormous stacked sliced deli meat type sandwich by design, even a quarter of it is impressive, (you can order just a quarter sandwich);  it did look great here as touted in all the Yelp reviews...but I wasn't feelin' like more luncheon meats with olive tapenade...so I went with the JAMBALAYA. It arrives in an underwhelming way on a platter, with three ice cream scoopfuls and two slices of bread and a tab of butter...hmmmm. [See pic]

I told my waiter I was not running out on the check, but heading to the restroom...he understood... I returned from the restroom, which is off a lovely and surprising inner courtyard with a running wall fountain...just lovely and mist from a spray of cooling water to spritz the customers as they dined in the humidity outside...I thought it was a very special place...until I saw two people sitting at my table. Hm. I was getting the bums' rush?!!! Really?!!! Maybe he could have offered me another table, maybe it was too embarrassing, or maybe it's not cost effective for customers to linger past 25 minutes...puzzling scenario and a first for me. Not sure what happened there.

I paid my check which was a very reasonable 10 buck and change...including my iced coffee..

PRO: Friendly waiter. Perhaps the food is good, but the JAMBALAYA was meh. Better to go to Willie's Chicken Shack and sauce it up with some good hot sauce. Classical music in the background elevated the place, perhaps undeservedly. LOVELY interior courtyard garden with fountain and spritzing mist.

CON: Unfriendly Front House. Left the table for 5 minutes to go to restroom, already had two people sitting at my table. Thank goodness I didn't leave my stuff there. Not cool, Napoleon House.

OVERALL: Mixed bag. Great experience of having Napoleon in paintings everywhere looking down at you...and the historic hearsay nature of the place...and a super nice waiter. Go somewhere else though if you want to linger and have dessert. I went to NOLA's but it was closed. Ended up waiting out a downpour across the street from Napoleon House at Pierre Maspero's for an awesome bread pudding.",2017-08-07 01:31:09
UyyAfDNFH6_c4In6LwIaDA,EvklJD323DhqSL4uEZP5bg,zM-FI9KgcFF8cO4ivQ44uw,1.0,5,1,1,"Very very disappointed! I feel like there had to be something off on the night my friend and I went (Sunday) because most of the recent reviews were awesome and our experience was just terrible.

So we sat down and were given menus and told the specials. We actually thought that the $20 (or $25 on Sunday) price fixe was just on Tuesdays, so when our server told us that they had a ""neighborhood appreciation special"" ($25 for 3 courses) we were impressed.

The thing our server forgot to mention was that the portion sizes would be at least half of the normal size. My friend and I had no problem splitting a salad and getting our own entrees, but under the guise of this appreciation thing, we thought you would be getting the same food (or at least something similar).

The salads were really good- mixed bibb lettuce with bacon and tomato in a buttermilk dressing. And really big! 

When we were brought our entrees, we thought it was a joke. I ordered the bass, and I eat a lot of fish so I know what it is supposed to look like. Bass is a meaty, thick white flaky fish. The thing that came out on the plate looked like a piece of scrap they give you at the fish store to cook with your food and give to the dog. It was so tiny and thin that you literally had to scrape the fish off the skin so you wouldnt eat the skin. To top it all off, the portion was two small bites and it was under seasoned and borderline overcooked. The side dish, kind of like a vegetable hash with corn and asparagus, was bigger than the fish itself- really sad. Also, compared to the salad it was really inconsistent.

My friend's chicken dish was fine, but it was one really thin chicken cutlet served with a side of romaine salad and one fingerling potato chopped into four tiny rounds. Thats it. One baby potato. Those things are tiny. The chicken was so thin that it was also undercooked.

I mentioned to the server that I didn't like my dish and she suggested I try the cod. I tried it and it was slightly thicker than the bass, but once again the plate was covered in leaves and garnishes. The summer rolls didn't have an assortment of vegetables, just lots of lettuce and tiny pieces of pineapple. There were also mounds of microgreens all over the plate. The poor little piece of fish got lost in all of those leaves.

We decided to stick around for dessert since it was part of the meal. The cheesecake was disgusting. The pan they cooked it in was too wide for the amount of filling they put in it and it probably immediately fell when it started to cool and was thin, but thick dense and really eggy.

I guess the server felt bad for my friend who was clearly still hungry so she brought out this HUGE strawberry rhubarb ""cobbler"" for her. It must have been four to five cups of the stuff in this huge ramekin, and sprinkled with crumbled oats, not cobbler. It was ridiculous and kinda sickening after such little food for the entree.

I am so disappointed with Paul and can't believe that this is how they do business. I don't think that it's right at all to cut down portions and quality as much as they do and call it ""neighborhood appreciation."" Even if they had doubled or tripled the portion of meat they served it still wouldn't be of the same cut and quality as other BYOB's such as Fond.

I prefer to eat at places like Paul instead of patronizing Stephen Starr restaurants on a regular basis, but the inconsistency and outrageous price will make me re-think ever returning here.",2010-06-08 01:02:13

However, Scott from Sustainable Vine Wine Tours gave me and my girlfriend an unforgettable experience so the least I could do is help spread the word about the amazing time Scott gave us.

My girlfriend and I aren't the party/Las Vegas type, so I decided to take her out for a weekend in Santa Barbara for her 21st birthday. My girlfriend and I are getting into wine so I decided that a private wine tour would be a perfect way to celebrate her 21st birthday. After doing extensive research, I came across reading and trusting the five-star reviews of Sustainable Vine Wine Tours and I am more than glad I booked a private wine tour with Scott.

When I booked the private tour with Scott, I had many questions and Scott was always prompt in answering my emails. I told him that my girlfriend and I want to learn more about wines and we prefer reds but are also open to trying whites so he assured us that he would come up with the perfect itinerary and he did not disappoint. He picked us up from the Spanish Garden Inn at 10:10 am as promised in a luxurious Mercedes GL SUV. We went to a total of four wineries that had all had a different environment. The wineries that Scott chose were perfect because they had a variety of wines that my girlfriend and I learned more about and enjoyed, such as Grenache. 

I agree with the review before mine in that Scott was the best part of the tour. He's a genuine, funny, and friendly person that made the tour an even better experience. He was not only our driver, but he became our new friend who gave me and my girlfriend a perfect balance of privacy and publicity during our private wine tour. He is very knowledgable in his wines and places to capture perfect moments.

I would definitely come back to Scott to have a private and/or group wine tour because my girlfriend and I had an unforgettable time because of him. If you are thinking about taking your significant other for a private wine tour in Santa Barbara, Scott from Sustainable Vine Wine tours will not disappoint. Or, if you want to have an amazing and safe time with a group of friends, Scott can host for you all as well. You will undoubtedly have an amazing time and gain a new friend.",2015-01-18 02:37:17

9gEz2jDHFId4pyMLgDinbA,fx0nwBe3oQlgNPu1iGbfAA,_34KJPR-T0HP9USJw1nCfw,2.0,12,5,4,"Stay home and enjoy a $0.65 Nong Shim Shin Ramyun instead. I've been to ramen shops from NY to Tokyo, and this place served me the single worst bowl of ramen I have ever had that didn't come from a microwave in a styrofoam cup.  This is neither bitterness nor hyperbole, but the facts as I see them.

The place itself is tucked away behind the bus stop next to Milk-Boy on the SW corner of 11th and Chestnut. It doesn't have a sign and the front is nondescript, so with any luck, you'd miss it, and end up someplace better.  Once you've had the misfortune of finding it, the decor is mundane and sparse, but acceptable, though not overtly Japanese.  There are some wood strips on the walls, bright retro drop-lights, and it's relatively clean  overall, like a Chipotle, without all the planning and execution.

After sitting down at a cramped little wooden table, my friends and I were unanimously shocked to see their hand-written, xeroxed menu with only three unappealing options (and no prices-- which turned out to be $9): shoyu ramen soup, shoyu vegetarian soup and shoyu minus soup, with slightly thicker noodles.  These are the absolute most basic preparations imaginable, and the complete antithesis of the rich tonkotsu from the stock photo on Hiro's web site, or the ""Gates of Hell noodles"" mentioned in their Menupages article (and perhaps most disappointingly, the Yelp reviews, which now appear to be utter fabrications).  I felt baited and switched, and I wanted to get up and leave right then, but moving a group of hungry people to a different restaurant can be an equally unpleasant endeavor.  We reluctantly ordered, and there were no vegetarians among us, so we only managed to cover 2/3 of their ""menu"". Apart from the broth and noodle size, these observations apply to both wet and dry shoyu dishes, as they were essentially identical:

Improper and inconsistent plating: unlike some of the other shoyus at my table, mine was assembled so that it appeared to contain neither pork-belly or the half egg.  After a moment of confusion, I determined that both were trapped in the broth beneath the clump of noodles.  I'm sure it doesn't seem like a big deal, but even if you start with a perfect hanjuku egg (which cooks at around 64ºC) , burying it in the broth causes overcooking and other textural issues.  All that aside, this is an indication of their level of pride and care, and I shudder to think what kind of unholy congress they'd have with a real menu.

Insipid broth: shoyu is admittedly simple, but at least start with a robust chicken stock, and a good quality soy sauce.  It was a depthless, under-salted, flavorless brown wash, and I wouldn't be surprised if they make it in a 55 gallon trash can from Sysco chicken powder and lite commodity soy sauce.  It's not that it tastes of rot or anything, but there's just nothing to recommend it, and this is THE thing you gotta nail if you open a ramen hut.

Poorly cooked protein: if you're going to torch a raw slice of porkbelly, you must employ proper technique, or it will taste and smell of uncombusted propane, and your sear marks will also reflect your lack of care in the form of a boiled, sweaty appearance, with intermittent charring.  I cook with a blowtorch almost every day, so this may be something that only bothers me, but again, if you're going to do something simple, you'd better do it well. 

Noodles: unremarkable, and probably dried, with a greasy quality that I suspect is the result of rolling them in oil, so they don't stick together.  They are of the curly variety, and for whatever reason struck me as more ""Chinese"" in composition.  Now that I think about it, I'd say that applies to the flavor profile of their dishes in general.  If that's what you're looking for, and you don't care about the egg, I suggest you go to get Nan Zhou hand drawn noodles instead. 

Despite any other reviews you may read here, this place does not compare favorably to Terakawa in any way. This restaurant experience, and my recent frustration with the blatantly purchased nature of some reviews has finally driven me to review something.  I'm incredibly lazy, so that's just how bad it is.



@C K.  You're a nervy shill to call anyone else ""fishy"". If you read my entire review, you will notice that this is the first place to frustrate me enough to write a review. I ""updated"" my photo, because I noticed that Yelp's system deleted the very same photo, which I uploaded when I opened the account a few years ago.  As for ""thrillist video"", I have no idea what that's about (feel free to send me a URL) but I use my Bernzomatic TS4000 torch all the time, and I saw their torch in the kitchen.  Do you think they use it to boil the vegetable stock?",2012-10-19 18:40:32

Well if you read my review of Bayou St. John you will know my great love affair with Mid-City. One wonderful update to report is that with the help of my mother my dreams came true and I bought a condo right on the bayou! Looks like this commitment phobe has finally put down some roots and I'm staying!

Although I was born in Canada I grew up in New Orleans since I was five years old and consider myself a proud New Orleanean. As a child I always loved NOMA and city park and went to art camp and tennis camp respectively.

And now Mid-City is under going it's own renaissance! New restaurants and businesses are popping up like Panera Bread (love their soup, pastries and soy chai lattes!), Pei Wei (still need to try them), Pinkberry (and it's open late-so evil), Tutti fruitti (on esplanade near Nona Mia), MoPho (need to check them out, my favorite waitress Lorianna is there and told me about it), Five Guys (which I always call five Brothers for some reason?), fancy Winn Dixie, Felipe's, Verizon, baskin Robbins, Office Depot, and so forth and so on! 

And once the VA hospital is completed this area will explode and gentrify even further (don't get me started on a sociological rant about gentrification, hey, my masters degree has to be good for something right? Hehe). So I would suggest if you want to buy do it now!

Mid-city hosts some of the best festivals in the city such as Jazz fest, Bayou Bougaloo, Voodoo fest, Earth Day fest, etc. Plus we have Celebration in the Oaks and Storyland for kids of all ages! The walking paths in the park are used by everyone and heck you can even rent those cool bikes and paddle boats! And one day I want to take a romantic tour on the gondola-hint hint!

And NOMA, I have loved you since a little child when I took art camp there. Then volunteered as a high school student. I remember fondly the special event when my favorite work of set, Monet's Water Lilies was there and my Dad hooked us up with the special private event evening showing. Walking amongst my favorite art was so blissful. I have visited museums throughout the world (Louvre, throughout Paris, London, Dublin, etc) but NOMA has a special place in my heart.

I will always love you Mid-City!",2014-01-04 16:04:50

It pains me to write this update because I never saw this coming...

Been here so many times...recommended  them to more people than I can remember. Drove to Bensalem all the way from Center city in traffic because in my mind it was worth it. 
I'm not even sure where to begin...
Came here after a horrible day at work and really needed to bury my face in a good curry. We arrived to a half empty restaurant and were greeted by our somewhat clueless American host/waiter (I'm American so no harm intended). Saw a familiar face (I assume he is the owner/manager) and my mind was put at ease. 
I really don't want to get started on this waiter but come on man...what the hell??? I'm not a total asshole but hey man...how are you guys doing tonight? My name is blah blah blah and I'll be taking care of you tonight. Not so much. He finally took our orders after clumsily plopping down our waters and chutneys. We ordered our favorite dishes and a few appetizers. The appetizers were fine but the portions seemed smaller than usual...fine. The entrees are where it all went wrong.
After sampling the dishes we realized they were completely bland. The palak paneer tasted like creamed spinach and our chicken dish was as equally as bland. I attribute this to our waiter assuming his fellow Americans couldn't handle the spice. I hate sending food back because you hear all those horror stories about food that goes back and I also hate being a pain in the ass...

The horror story:

So our food came back and I was eager to dig in. After my first bite I realized something was horribly wrong. after further inspection I realized I consumed about a tablespoon of raw chili powder (note to kitchen- ever hear of a spoon? ever hear of stirring the food?) I sat there for a few minutes...my face was red and my stomach was burning. After a few more minutes I gave a nod to the owner (who for some reason seemed flustered and stressed). He was horrified and seemed truly embarrassed...He should be.  He took 1 dish off our bill and we packed the rest to go. (we still ended up paying around 35 dollars for completely inedible food)
So after a long night and an equally long morning with all the wonderful things that go along with consuming raw chili powder I pondered my leftovers and put them where they belonged...in the trash.

Like I said...it pains me to write this review.
The owner is really nice but I can't justify going back after this. It was embarrassing on so many levels it's ridiculous. It's obvious the kitchen doesn't match his passion for good food, and  It's also clear his server doesn't match his passion for good service. Without this you have nothing.",2014-03-23 20:21:41

After being ignored on a  dead Saturday at the front we got seated then waited 10 minutes, no one talked to us, brought us water anything. Yet there was about 5 teenage looking employees standing around jaw jacking amongst themselves. Apparently we were interrupting social hour. Needless to say we walked out and announced why. HORRIBLE SERVICE.

*Update
The owner reached out to me because I was pretty agitated to the point I called. First I got someone else who I assume was the manager on shift that night, who made excuses and was mildly condescending. Made comments about an hour discussing my feedback with the staff, how they did X dollars in business that night and were busy. Look Came in at 8:50, I know they close at 9:30, we wanted to get in eat and get out. We walked out at about 9:05, only service we got was a mildly rude hostess that seemed a tad insistent that we were just getting ice cream. Anyway we walked out went to another establishment that nigh in the same parking lot that is a Franchise but is known for good Chicago pizza. We had drinks and appetizers and were talk to by no less than 4 employees in the same roughly 15 minutes we spent in Sullivan's, plus the food at that place was better than the other location so they will be my next 5 star. 

The Owner called to he apologized, that manager did not and made excuses. 

Look I've had lousy service, I've worked in restaurants before, I've never walked out and felt bad doing so, but it was merited. Sorry but 5 visible employees not viably working and 75% of your tables and seats empty is not busy. 

By the Owners talking to me and expressing genuine concern my review has been revised. I will probably quietly stop in and finally try their food and was adamant to the owner I do not want freebie's or hand outs since I never bought anything to begin with in their place. 

For the Wilma F. person above who seems to have an agenda or some relationship to the place or it's employees. Take a look and my review distribution and embellish a tad less. Your embellishments on my reviews erodes your credibility. 

20 1,2 Star reviews

Yeah I miss the Pizza, Coffee, Bagels, Chinese and a few other things to include the stricter restaurant health standards, too many places I walk into in Arizona are visibly filthy so makes you wonder what you cannot see in the back. NY makes Sushi Chefs wear gloves and they should it's raw final product that you are eating. 

But Tucson is fine with me, just tighten up the health codes and enforcement  and maybe that KVOA Kitchen Cops guy will lose his job. 

But Sullivan's did look clean which is one of the first things I take into consideration when walking into a restaurant.

*update 2
The owner trolled me a year later even though I revised up too 3 stars. Instead in fixing the service issues a customer reported, he basically threw a temper tantrum and was trying to out my identity. Sure I am not the only person who left a honest but unfavorable review who he harassed. They were very condescending and rude, no wonder the service was dismal. 1 Star",2015-08-16 10:29:24

I should've realized from the time I moved in that this was going to be a bad experience. I had to make  3 requests prior to move in to properly clean the house due to the kitchen still having food in it from the previous tenant, grease and dirt on the stove, dirty dishes in the dishwasher, and urine in the toilet.  
Then I had a random phone calls from a realtor demanding pictures of my home with no explanation. I had to callTCS management 4 times asking what this was about with no return calls or messages until after the 5th call to find out the owner has decided to sell the house. No communication from the management company, only the listing agent.  
Now, I've been dealing with a significant leak in my finished basement for a month and it still has not been resolved. I submitted an urgent maintenance  request and 48 hours later 2 guys showed up with very little advance notice, spent 10 minutes looking at my basement and outside on the patio then said ""we will be back 20 minutes"". I never hear from or saw anyone again. After 9 days, 4 voicemails, and 2 additional maintenance requests later I finally hear back from TCS saying the owner has approved the repair work and that I will be hearing from the TCS approved repair man.  The next day I get a call from the repair man and schedule a day and time.  That day comes and he texts and says he can't come back because of the weather so we reschedule.  That day comes and he doesn't show up.  I call and he stumbles and says ""oh my guys got into a car accident"".  They finally come the next day only to tape trash bags around an area where they believe the leak is coming from.  Two days later my finished basement still has water in it and it is still actively leaking.  I have also made multiple requests for a mold test with no response. 
This company is TERRIBLE with communication and responding to their tenants concerns.  But if you owe $27 for a water bill they contact you constantly.  Don't rent from them if you are concerned about living in a moldy house or believe in proper communication",2020-10-30 12:34:26

BUT, if you haven't spent time at Rae's, I don't know that you've really experienced pure sandwich bliss. If you don't know it, you need to fix that now. Today. It's almost lunch time. Rae's caters to the work crowd and isn't as convenient (hours, location and parking). BUT the product is every bit as magical as you might imagine and definitely worth the time and effort it might take to get there.

I came here for a work lunch on a busy Friday. It's location on Union is no fun because you know parking is a pain around this area. [Point of Order: Nashville, we have to talk about viable public transit. It's time and your downtown businesses aren't getting as much as business as they should (see my Ichiban review) because you haven't figured out the transit/parking issue. You're, at least, two years late on this fix it.] Once I looped the block a couple of times and suggested* to a woman who was idling in a parking space that she should move, I was able to come in and see what's happening.

There's a huge menu board to the right, once you enter, that's filled with specials, sandwich choices and all other goodies. Depending on the day and time, though, you may have to change your plans. I had crab cakes on my mind but arrived too late to enjoy them. Everything's made fresh and to order. Once it's gone, it's gone. I 'settled' on the Wicked Chicken sandwich, bowl of red beans, pomegranate (hallelujah, holla back!) San Pellegrino, and a huge brownie. Lay off me; I was starving.

I didn't have to wait too long before my food was ready and I ready to dig in. Oh, you seat yourself after going to the counter and ordering all the food. My sandwich was a stack of chicken, chipotles, lettuce, tomato, and green chili sauce. If it weren't already hot, I could have had my fill from the hot sauce bar that adorns the pay counter. When I tell you this sandwich was incredible... child, please. I was reat' to testify in Rae's. My red beans (to which I *did* add hot sauce) were the perfect compliment to my behemoth of a sandwich. I tried taking small sips of my soda, as this was a San Pellegrino flavor I'd yet to have. #heavenly I was so stuffed, I couldn't fit my brownie in my belly. But, best believe, I destroyed it as a late afternoon snack later that day. Rae's is worth me scheduling meetings downtown JUST so I can go hog-wild on the menu. Wacky hours, difficult parking and non-glam location and all... it's just that good. Go today!

We got there at the beginning of the fundraiser and the hostess didn't know there was a fundraiser going on since her shift had just started.  That was a little disconcerting, and we really hoped that our purchase went towards the fundraiser, because when we left the place all the fundraiser diners were in one spot outside.  Oops!  So they seated us and we started checking out the menu.  I knew I wanted to try a few of the beers and they have a couple of options to let you do so.  You can get a very small taster cup for free, or you can pay for a 4 oz. sample for $1 - I thought that was a pretty fair shake, and I'm glad I got the free taste.  I REALLY liked the McClearen's Scottish Ale.  I expected it to be heavier and it really wasn't - just pleasantly dark and surprisingly refreshing.  It went really well with the beer battered fish and chips I ordered.  Instead of regular fries I ordered sweet potato fries and the beer complimented them both very nicely.  Our dinners came with soup or salad and we both opted for salads.  They were plain tossed salads, which is fine, but the pieces of lettuce were WAAAAAAAY too big!  They need to tear them into smaller bite-sized pieces.  The fish was cod - buttery and crisp - very nice flavor.  The coleslaw was average.  My sweetie ordered the tenderloin and was sorrowfully disappointed.  It's not a breaded tenderloin at all.  It was a pork fritter.  Yuck.  And although the menu did not expressly indicate that it was a genuine breaded tenderloin, he went with his gut feeling because of the other offerings on the menu.  Boy, was he wrong!  He got the onion rings and they were STELLAR.  We also shared a dessert that was above average.  The service started out GREAT but faded fast as more customers came in the restaurant.  And it's not that they were slammed or anything...she just didn't speed up to keep up with the demand of more customers.  Overall, I think our experience here was good.  I'd love to come back and try more of the beers and some different menu items.  They do a lot of cooking with beer here and I love that, so I'll definitely return to try more of the fare.

H2_MI0VWxzuEUhbo0Y778Q,S--LBxBTNIDHMk_Nv7mBig,hYonVJe6xzVBHHT2FLo4zg,4.0,1,0,0,"Some really good things and a few not so good.  First it is by far the closest to authentic Chicago deep dish in Nashville (apart from my homemade version which rocks!!).  So many places call themselves Chicago style but all they do is make a thick crust and throw on toppings (in the wrong order by the way).  If you know Chicago pizza then this is most like Giordanno's.  We've been here many times but the most recent deep dish we got was too ""soupy"" if that's a word for pizza.  What I mean is when they dished out the slices it was very runny and spread out all over the plate.  It was no longer a slice of pizza but a puddle of pizza.  Deep dish pizza needs to rest, just like lasagna.  Because they take so long at 312 to make their deep dish they probably just want it out on the table ASAP.  I understand that but they need to come up with better organization in their kitchen to allow for the deep dish to rest several minutes.  When you go to Gino's East or Lou Malnati's in Chicago they get deep dish out in 45 minutes and it's perfect.  Here you can easily wait an hour.  As much as I love Chicago deep dish my favorite is actually Chicago thin crust.  312 has excellent thin crust pizza, one of the best in all of the state.  

The dining room is nice with a number of things honoring the great city of Chicago.  It has just enough Chicago décor to give you a Chi-town atmosphere, yet not too much so they don't overdo it for those who couldn't care less.  
I wish they had fountain Coke.  They have the Mexican Coke in a bottle, which is good, but can be pricey if you have to wait an hour for your deep dish to cook and you drink 2 or 3.  Even if you go with their copy-cat fountain Coke (which isn't that great) you still pay for refills.  On a visit back in 2015 I complimented one of the owner's on how authentic the deep dish was.  I then mentioned that I had in my freezer at home several frozen pizzas from Gino's East and Lou Malnati's (the top 2 deep dish pizza places in Chicago and the world).  In response she said her crust was better and made some snide remark about those places.  First of all, respect the originals and the best.  Second, what competition are they to you as they're both 400+ miles away?  Sounds jealous to me.  Regardless I'll continue to visit 312 periodically and pay for refills.  I'm glad to have them in town, but would love it if they had some competition.  Rosati's (a Chicago pizza place) has a location now in Knoxville so maybe they'll eventually find their way to Nashville.  That would be great because Rosati's is a little better than 312.",2016-03-25 02:58:37
rmr7OLD8HfQA5DspEkUd7Q,A9cXP_K95FRor1qxuUEu2g,ZipaR6Tyd3IandZHwG6ubw,5.0,5,0,2,"There are two national chains that seem to garner their share of ""haters"" both for legit and not so legit reasons - Chick-fil-A and Starbucks. Chick-fil-A has obvious concerns politically, while Starbucks seems to garner hate mostly because it's the ""big brother"" type coffee house that has replaced local, indie-tinged coffeehouses nationwide. 

The truth is, as evidenced by sales, that most of us still go to both places. Chick-fil-A has, hands down, the best customer service in the fast food world while Starbucks is so woven into the fabric of our culture that many people don't say ""I'm going to grab a coffee."" They say ""I'm going to grab a Starbucks."" 

I generally try not to review a lot of ""chain"" businesses on Yelp, but there are times when it's warranted. This is one of those times. 

This Starbucks is located directly on Monument Circle in a building my father once helped renovate. It's on a busy corner and has two entrances.  Both entrances have older, wooden with glass-filled doors that can be a bit difficult to open. They also both have serious lips at the door that can be a bit difficult in wheelchairs. Unless you're downtown already, there's little chance you've come here as a destination because parking downtown is difficult and largely paid. Because this is Monument Circle, a wheelchair user has to also deal with the cinder block sidewalk with certain blocks that seem to always be loose. 

While I'd visited this location before, the truth is that even as someone who works downtown I seldom go as far as Monument Circle from my nearby Government Center office. 

Over the course of a fundraiser/awareness event that lasted around 4 days, I got to know this Starbucks very well as they became involved, almost last minute, in supporting my event. 

Over the course of four days, I was permitted to use their restroom without a purchase (I was staying on Monument Circle 24/7; so this was a big deal). I was also provided water periodically and, a couple times, alternative drinks. The regional director for Indiana also ended up supporting in other ways. 

This location, which is pending a needed renovation as the inside offers no seating but does have window counters, Is a frequently busy location that attempts to manage the chaos in a structured, occasionally stringent way. This area also is frequented by members of Indy's homeless community, most of whom have developed a sort of peaceful co-existence with Starbucks and its mostly compassionate employees who are still tasked with ensuring the business remains safe and responsible. 

Over the course of four days, I witnessed employees who were unified, enthusiastic, fun, efficient, and effective at their jobs. I witnessed a manager, Dawn, who remained aware of what was going on and worked to keep people on task while creating a fun, caring environment. As someone whose work they were supporting, I was greeted by name with enthusiasm, concern, and warmth every single time I entered the place. 

Every time. 

The drinks I ordered were always delivered as ordered, while the one time I special ordered a food item it was also delivered as ordered. The restroom, which is now operated by code rather than key, is a one-user restroom with appropriate hand-rails and a motion sensor hand-dryer. Even when I was really tired, it was easy to use. 

There's no question at its most crowded that it can be difficult to navigate in Starbucks, though for the most part I never had difficulty and found most of the customers cooperative with my mobility. 

While I don't know the details of the upcoming renovation, my understanding is it will make for a roomier, more hospitable experience. Starbucks also offers outdoor seating when it's weather appropriate. However, for a stellar experience over a period of 4 days and warm, enthusiastic support of one lonely activist's endeavor to make his community a safer place for children I'm giving Starbucks a well deserved 5-star review.",2019-10-08 07:56:30

The historical significance was something I was most excited for and was hearing all about. It had also been featured on various tv shows so when I flew in to New Orleans I knew this was the place I need to go to. On February 15 2019 with a  reservation for large group people we gathered to eat at this restaurant. The place was overflowing with people dressed in all different attire. The waiting/bar area was so packed, we had no where to sit. That wasn't much of an issue as we were sat at our table 15 minutes later. We got to the table and the table was covered in pepper and crumbs for some reason. Regardless, the waitress came a couple of minutes later, took our drank order and left for a significant amount of time. At least 20 minutes before we saw her again. But we were brought stale garlic bread in the meantime. So that was something. When she came back she with our drinks they were underwhelming, overly sweet. My boyfriend ended up not liking his drink and requested a type of whisky on the rocks while we ordered our appetizers. The appetizers (crab soups) came out quick  and semi-hot but very spicy.  My boyfriends drink didn't come still. When she came out with the salads (which we are all confused about getting as no ones food came with one and no one requested one- they weren't big fyi) she mentioned they didn't have the whiskey he had requested and asked if he wanted the back up whiskey he asked for if they were out of the first one....we are now 40 minutes into service and she never put in his drink order!  He canceled the drink and the food came out a little later. I got a stuffed chicken with sweet potato's which wasn't bad but not very big. My boyfriend and his parents got the seafood etouffe with angel hair pasta. Both of them said it was not warm at all and bland. I tasted it and honestly it was disgusting. Very bland and the shrimp had a very weird texture with a seafood smell when means it isn't fresh. I found overall the food to be surprisingly expensive for a bland and dry set of dishes.

XXXXXX,

I hope you are well and now that some time has passed, I wanted to write you in a very calm, polite, and 'matter of fact' state.

After I did all of my research, I wanted to write you and advise you what the outcome is regarding the situation that you left me with in which I was more than upset.  My research included things I found online as well as other professionals in your industry and even trained Jeep technicians.

1. I went back to the last one who touched my car before it went to you.  I was told that they put the lugs on by hand BEFORE tightening.  Therefore any 'cross threading' would not be possible at all.
2. Even if it was 'cross-threaded,' there are ways to get it off without the method your shop had chosen.
3. My research has told me that common lug sizes are in whole numbers.  Example would be a 22 or 23 size.  
a. My Jeep takes a 22.5 size which is not that common, but is available through some vendors. 
b. Using the next size up (23) would cause the stud to break.
4. What you described to me in a repair of $1,600  was ludicrous as here is what I paid for it to be repaired:
a. $21 for the stud and lug (at a Jeep dealer)
b. $180 for a used rim
c. $244 in labor to remove the wheel, open the hub assembly, and properly fit the stud in place.

I know you told me that the rim was $688 for a new one and I found one for more than $500 less since it was used, but with the rest of the numbers you were going to try and charge me $900 more than what the job costed me.
Furthermore, the broken stud did NOT need to be removed the way that your guys destroyed the wheel AND I now completely believe that this whole thing was a fault of your shop.  Additionally, I asked you to save the lug once removed so I could go back to the other shop that did the work last.  That was supposed to happen, but when I came to get the car you told me it was thrown away.

You have taken a 20 year relationship and dismissed it since you chose not to work with me on this issue and just 'washed your hands' of even the possibility that your shop may have caused the problem.  You did this after telling me that it was not safe to drive with only the 4 studs and did not want to release the car to me. You then simply demanded I come to get it.  So if it wasn't safe, why would you put someone's safety at risk?

In the end there are many places to go and get auto service.  Your shop was one that I always tried to solicit due to our past relationship.  However, moving forward I do not think it is necessary as this was the first problem encountered and I see with my own eyes how you take care of problems that only cost me less than $450 to fix at retail.

I'm going to give a short description and then a detailed version of my experience.

First thing, what we ordered. Smoked wings appetizer, Smokehouse Reuben with smoked corned beef and potato salad, and the Stuffed Mac 'n' Cheese with pulled pork. 

Short description: The wings were over cooked, but flavorful. My first Smokehouse Reuben was inedible, but the replacement was delicious. The Stuffed Mac 'n' Cheese was good, but poorly described on the menu. It has a potato chip crust, which my wife would not have ordered if it had been on the menu. 

Long version: I have heard dozens of people rave about these smoked wings. I understand BBQ is not a perfect science and sometimes gets messed up. We got some of the messed up ones. Very dry.

My first Smokehouse Reuben was awful. My marble rye bread was so stale it crumbled when pinched. Bread was not buttered and toasted as a Reuben should be. The ""smoked corned beef"" (smoked corned beef is pastrami so they should just call it that) was so tough it couldn't be pulled apart. I sent it back. At this point I had had dry wings and a terrible sandwich so I was ready to just have my sandwich taken off the bill, pay for the rest of the meal and never come back. However, the kitchen had miraculously just pulled a fresh ""smoked corned beef"" off the smoker and would like me to try a small sample. It was quite nice. I decided I would have a new sandwich instead of it being taken off the bill. The second sandwich was very good, but the bread was still pretty dry. Butter and toast that bread people! 

The deviled egg potato salad was very bland. I don't like to season things at a restaurant I don't work at. You pay your cooks to season the food, not me.

My wife got the Stuffed Mac 'n' Cheese. She wanted the pulled pork sandwich initially but it comes tossed in sauce which we don't like, but that's personal preference I guess. It comes topped with a potato chip crust, which I thought was nice, but was not described on the menu and some people don't like a crusted Mac. We both agreed the actual pasta and cheese sauce was pretty good. I do hate anything being described as ""famous"" though. I had never heard of it before we ate here. How famous could it be?

A few side notes:
The food runner was wearing basketball shorts. Laid back restaurant or not, that's just unprofessional.
The sauces (which I only tried on the wings since they were so dry) were underwhelming. Smoked garlic sauce tasted like Italian dressing with smoked garlic blended in. White BBQ was solid, though.
We were the only table in the restaurant at the time and instead of being treated to amazing service, we felt like an inconvenience to the servers and cook hanging out at the bar. 

The disappointing thing about this restaurant is that this could have easily been a 5 star review with a little effort. Maybe next time...",2017-06-18 04:24:21

I came here as a delivery driver to pick up a third-party delivery order.  As I approached the storefront, there were two other customers waiting near the pick-up window.  Those customers are served their slices, and I step up to the service area immediately.  Six months ago, I wouldn't have been able to be so specific, but I was exactly six feet behind those customers.  Nevertheless, the staff inside ignores me and turns his back to retreat into the inaccessible bowels of the kitchen. 

Well, technically, I suppose I should have been at the ordering window; not the pick-up door, but I was aware of that in the moment and I moved back to the ordering window.  The ordering window was unstaffed, and there was no bell present to get the staff's attention.  So, I waited...  and waited... and waited... and waited.  Not really feeling comfortable screaming for attention on a public sidewalk, I began to wonder if they would answer the phone.  I retreated from the 110 degree heat to my car, and I just called the restaurant from about 8' outside their front door.  Surprisingly, someone answered.  I told him what order I was there to pick up and asked if it was ready.  He put me on hold for about 3 minutes, but came back to the line and told me the order was ready.  What luck!  Finally, this ordeal might be over.  I was calling the store from about 8 feet in front of the front door.  I told him over the phone that I would meet him at the pick up door immediately.

So, I went back to the door.  And I waited... and waited... and waited... and waited.  No staff and no pizza had appeared.  Again, I retreated from the 110 degree heat into my car.  This time, I called the company for which I was driving.  She put me on hold after I explained the situation in order to call Brooklyn.  When she came back to the line she explained that they wouldn't bring the pizza to the car, but they would bring it to the door.  I was frustrated, because I had never asked anyone to deliver the order to my car.  I still hadn't managed to attract staff to the ordering window or the pickup door; that was why I had called.  It just goes to show you how much we all suffer from off-shoring our call-center jobs.  I guess I was just going to have to overcome my reluctance to scream from the sidewalk for attention.

I went back to the ordering window, with my insulated bag in hand, and screamed from the sidewalk, ""Hello?  Are you open?  Pickup for Susan!"" (name altered).  I did get a response from inside, ""Yes""  someone shouted back.  Still, no one would approach the window or the door.  

I eventually had to take a penalty and a direct loss and just abandon this pickup.  No one EVER came to the door OR the window for me.  That's so inept that it defies any attempt to categorize it as ""innocent.""  These people are just EVIL.  

In conclusion, that's how hard it is to pick up a pizza from Brooklyn, and that's how little their staff regards their customers.  I used to order food from Brooklyn at least once a month.  In fact, I have a Brooklyn pizza box in my recycling now.  They've lost that business too, from this.  These people could just not care any less than they do.",2020-07-09 22:22:56

My mom wanted me to help her choose granite for her kitchen remodel and the contractor told us that this was the place to go. Once we arrived, it was clear that they certainly have a huge selection; they had many pieces of beautiful granite. However, the actual process of shopping for it is frustrating. You are not really allowed to walk around and look at anything, probably because they don't want people getting squished by the slabs, so we went inside in the hopes of finding a sales associate, and stood in the salesroom for about 20 minutes while employees walked past us, never asking if we needed help. Finally, my mom went to one of the women who was walking by and asked if we could get some help. The woman asked if we had an appointment, which we did not, and said they only have 2 salespeople, so she had no idea when someone would be able to help us, and she walked away. I had to be home by 4:00, so we didn't have the time to wait. My mom caught up with the same lady and told her that our contractor had told us to talk to a man named Paul. The woman looked at her like she had two heads and said, ""Paul's a cutter. He can't help you with that."" Then she walked away again! Finally (we had probably been her for 45 minutes already), my mom explained that we really needed to choose our granite today and that we were happy to go out in the yard and look on our own, if they would allow us. The lady was hesitant, but eventually gave us some post-it notes so we could mark what we liked and could talk to a salesperson when he finally became available.

So, we walked around the lot and narrowed down our choices to 2 really pretty pieces. We went back inside and we pretty much told that no one would be able to help us today. My mom was pretty frustrated because the contractor needed us to tell him what to order, so she talked the woman we had been dealing with into logging it into our account. This took a really long time because she couldn't get into the computer (she didn't have the passcode), so she had us come outside and show her the piece of granite. She was quite knowledgeable and was able to answer our questions, so we went back in and she finally was able to log in and put in a note for when the contractor came in to order.  We ended up needing to go back because we wanted a completely smooth piece and what we chose was not (this is not their fault; some people like that kind of countertop, we just wanted a smooth piece), and this time, we went to the lot with the contractor, so we didn't have to deal with any staff or ordering, which was good.

In the end, the countertop came out looking GORGEOUS and Paul, the cutter, did a wonderful job with it.  We were very happy with the results and the variety, but they need some work on the customer service end. I think they are used to contractors coming in and not the actual customers, so they aren't quite sure how to work with ""everyday people"" who have questions and need to spend time with a salesperson. I would definitely recommend getting granite here, but make sure you are with your contractor.",2016-07-25 00:03:07

I've actually been three times in the last two weeks.  Stopped in one late afternoon last week for a quick (note 'quick') early dinner.  Bartender was slow to notice I'd perched on stool at the bar but once I had his attention he made excellent suggestions both regarding a beer and for a salad.  My wait was nearly non-existant, the salad was incredible - I can't get their menu to download, so I can't tell you what it was exactly, but there were green leafy things and some marinated tomatoes that were to die for, a shaved hard, salty cheese, and chicken with a kick.  And everything was buried.  So it looked a little deceptive upon arrival but all the good stuff was in hiding.  Find it on the menu and order one.  

Second visit, took a friend.  We had a platter of ... slivered apples and cheese ... chips?  Sorry.  Also, the mac & cheese pot (served HOT, and spicy.  Delicious, if not quite like Mom used to make).  It was a Monday, and they're running burgers now on Mondays, although I didn't quite understand why.  I ordered a Black & Blue - sounded great, totally impulsive, but as it turned out the kitchen couldn't make it for whatever reason.  Second choice was the spicy burger, and friends, it nearly killed me.  They don't mess around with the spice, the thing was laced and I was in tears.  The only thing that threw me was that they have this lovely china and silverware but they served my burger in a disposable paper tray.  

And then I was in again last night, ergo the review.  Went alone with a book to read.  It can be a bit noisy - concrete floor - but I had a superb glass of wine (five letters, starts with L, OK there were two glasses), the coffee-braised beef brisket and ouzo (wow) and then some manchego which is accompanied by default by:  a hot, crispy, soft bread, cranberries, and a pile of nuts to please any squirrel.  We're talking walnuts, pecans, cashews, pistachios, and something I struggled to identify but I suspect it was sunflower seeds.  Or pumpkin seeds.  I don't know.  

Anyway, I love it.  Three visits, consistently good service, they are accessible on foot from any loft or hotel in downtown.  Check it out!",2010-05-04 00:04:38

H2O is good, don't get me wrong. But for $100, I would have expected to be a bit more wowed.

The service was excellent. I think our server is doing himself a disservice by working at H2O. With his formal attitude and extensive menu knowledge, I think he would be better suited at St. Elmo's or Morton's. He was attentive and efficient - but H2O seems a little too hip and contemporary for that kind of server.

Speaking of hip, the decor is... for the most part. The art on the walls is different and interesting - does anyone know if it's from local artists? The green neon light around the sushi bar is a little cheesy and doesn't really fit with the rest of the motif.

Anyway, the food. The nigiri was fresh. The tuna wasn't melt-in-your-mouth like it is at some places (Asaka, Kokoro), but it was tasty. They don't have a lot of choices in this department - I'd say seven or eight kinds of fish.

One of our dining partners tried the special udon noodle soup - it had a poached quail egg and various other goodies in it, topped with a huge prawn tempura. It looked delicious and they said it was very good, just needed a bit more broth to even things out.

The rolls... again, they were good, but nothing outstanding. We tried the Two Brothers which has salmon, tuna, cilantro and is topped with a tiny sliver of lime. Very fresh, very tasty... but nothing like Naked Tchopstix where I am constantly surprised at the combination of flavors they cram into one little roll. I also played it safe and ordered their ""Ultimate California"" roll - don't waste your time. It tastes exactly like a California (albeit a good one, since they use snow crab instead of that icky lye-soaked whitefish).

The did offer some interesting beer selections... a rice ale from The Great Divide, a microbrewery in Denver (I think it tasted like a more intense Blue Moon) and New Belgium's 1554 Black Ale. 

The dessert is really what stood out for me. Two little scoops of homemade ice cream, each a different flavor. We chose Persimmon and Salted Pistachio. Both were amazing! Our dining partners got the Oatmeal Date Bars and were equally as impressed.

Our bill for two people having edamame, seven different kinds of nigiri, two rolls, one beer, a green tea and the dessert came to $93 and some change. I know that sounds like a lot, but if we'd gone to Asaka during their happy hour, the bill would have been half as much and would have been just as good, if not a bit better.

I would go back here for dessert without question, but for sushi, I'll stick to someplace less expensive or more creative.",2009-12-06 14:48:22

This was my first visit.  It was on my list of places I wanted to try, but just never got around to it.  I was reminded by an article in the TP about their brick oven pizza.  When I checked the Yelp commentary and found out about the half price happy hour, I was in!  The plan was to stop in for a happy hour pizza and couple of drinks and then walk over to the Dirty Linen shindig.

The Roosevelt is old world beautiful.  It is not necessary to wander around the lobby aimlessly trying to find the restaurant, but there are worse way to spend a couple of minutes.  In fact, Domenica has a street entrance on Baronne, a fact that escaped us until we sat down.  However, if you are parked on the north side of the hotel, it is easier to walk through the hotel to get to the restaurant.

First impressions - this is really nice.  Contemporary styling, clean, light, bright and not too noisy.   Comfortable tables and chairs and good silverware (I hate that cheap stamped out stuff).  They were training new folks at the door, but still managed to get us seated quickly.  The waiter was by to quickly take and fill our drink order.  

The menu was broader than I expected but we were committed to pizza.  The pizza's look pretty big, so we were hesitant about ordering two. ""No guts, no glory"" - we took the plunge and ordered a ""Margherita"" and a ""Clams"" pizza.  After taking our order, bread was delivered to the table.  I don't remember that happening before.  Bread appetizer for a pizza dinner?  We weren't even sure we could eat the pizza and now we had a loaf of bread to contend with.  Start eating and stop your whining.  

Pizza arrived in a timely manner.  Very thin, toasted crust with light toppings.  The Margherita was good, but nothing notable.  The Clams was excellent, nice mix of spices and clams.   As I mentioned, they look pretty big, but they are very light and it is not a stretch to eat the whole pizza, even after a loaf of bread.  After the meal, some complementary cookies were served.  

My only complaint was that my beer glass was allowed to go empty while waiting for the pizza to arrive.  Seems like Table Waiting 101 to never let that happen.  It's not like I am chugging beers between bites of bread, how hard is it to wander past and check the drinks? 

The Happy Hour price for two was $30, tip included.  It seemed like a good value.  I'm not sure I would have thought the same thing if I was eating an hour later and it was $60.  Go for the Happy Hour.",2011-08-14 14:19:24

First of all I had called many other vets in the area and had several awkward and cold conversations before calling here. I was trying to find one that comes out to the house for our 12 year old Great Danes last day. It has been a sad and scary time for me. Every person I spoke with at House Paws was so very understanding and kind, even though I had called several times asking tons of questions. They always made time and never rushed me. 

I had been expecting the day the vets were scheduled to come out to be the absolute worst day of my life. While it was very sad, I can't imagine it going any better. My doggie usually is very protective and doesn't like new people in her house. As soon as they came in the door she barked once and that was that. She sat down with them and they were so very kind to all of us. They didn't make us feel silly for having candles, party lights, and photos of our pup out. They even complimented our ""soundtrack"" we were playing. Now I realize that being vets you have to be dog people but these ladies were more than that. They really show genuine compassion and kindness for us and our doggie. They gave us time to sit with her, give her kisses and hugs, and never rushed us. They did a footprint for her in the nicest leather box I've ever seen. They both even hugged us and expressed their condolences. 

The next day the staff called me to ask how our appointment went and also how we have been doing. She let me know that if I had any questions or was upset and needed to talk to someone that either of us could call the office at any time. 

""Shsail S."" reviewed that they had lost their pet and caused added drama to her trauma. Let me just say that after going through taking a pup to other vets and had actually traumatizing experiences where they didn't give the doggie anything to sedate him and just shot him up and dropped him in our arms. Where they were outright mean and unfeeling. If they lost my pet I would be totally fine with it after the OUTSTANDING and EXCEPTIONALLY KIND service. Mistakes happen but thankfully not when it really mattered. My best friends last moments with us were wonderful and that's so much more than I expected.",2016-03-21 18:37:11

I ordered a wig and rollerball perfume from this company on February 8. Standard shipping, which was supposed to take 3-7 days. By February 20 I had still heard absolutely nothing, so I contacted them to find out what was going on. A couple days later they get back to me and let me know that the wig I ordered is out of stock in the color I selected and what other color would I like. I responded immediately by saying I wasn't comfortable with another color and if they didn't have the one I ordered then I would like to cancel my order. 

I was absolutely shocked when a couple days later I get a tracking number and confirmation that the order was sent, but figured maybe they just sent out the perfume and canceled the wig. But no. They sent the perfume and also a wig that was a color of THEIR choosing. NOT what I ordered. The colors are in the same color family (red) but I specifically didn't order one in this particular range because the other color was what I was more comfortable with. Reds are difficult to work with if you aren't a natural red head!

The second I saw that the color was wrong, I contacted them. Didn't even take the wig out of the bubble mailer, much less the bag it was in. The people at this company touched this wig more than I did, but trying to return it has turned into a national incident. We then had a back and forth about doing a return. They finally agreed to it after I pointed out that it was noted by them on the invoice packed in with my order that they had sent a different color for the out of stock one (they had initially tried to lie and tell me the reason they sent the order after receiving my cancellation request was because they got the color I ordered in, but that was clearly untrue, although I had to send pictures). 

Ok, agreed to return, item sent back, tracking (and customer service) confirmed it arrived safely, that should be it, right? NO! I get another nasty surprise when they send me an email to confirm that they have received the package back and want to know which I want to do.... Exchange, store credit, or ""return"". All of this comes with conditions (like 30% restocking fee!!!) because they also let me know they don't accept returns on hair ever. The no returns on hair would be fine with me if they had sent me the item I myself ordered. Instead THEY CHOSE to send me something different and now want to penalize me monetarily, for their wrong item??? 

Awwww hell naw! A customer shouldn't have to accept any item the company decides to send! I ordered a specific item, if that item is wrong then it doesn't matter what they do or don't accept returns on. They made the mistake. Give me my money back! 

I ended up having to file a PayPal claim because they stopped responding once I told them it was unacceptable to take some of my money for an item they chose to send incorrectly. The claim is currently still going because they lied to PayPal and told PayPal that I still needed to send the item back. I'm usually very good at not losing it on people who aren't the ones causing the problem, but that was the first time I went on a serious rant at the PayPal rep over an issue I'm having with a purchase.  

This company is a scam. I would seriously recommend staying away unless you have money to throw down into a bottomless pit or you enjoy receiving items that aren't what you ordered and can afford to lose money on your order. 

If my PayPal claim fails I will be filing with the Better Business Bureau too. I'm sure this company has plenty of complaints, all of them well earned. However, they now have both my money AND the incorrect item. I don't want an exchange or store credit. I never want to deal with them again. I want my money back for that wig. ALL of it. No exchange, no store credit, no restocking fee. Stop wasting my time. Refund. 

I've included some pictures. Seriously, just stay away from this place!",2018-04-12 18:59:54

Came here by chance on a Friday night after hanging out for happy hour on St. Pete beach.  My girlfriend and I were looking for a place for dinner, and nothing was really calling to us.  We decided to look in Gulfport, knowing we had eaten at the French place a couple of times and really liked it.  We found Peg's, and though we question the ""Tex-Mex"" description - how is this menu a mixture of Texas and Mexican - it looked interesting and had to be tried.

Firstly, I love the set up.  Like everything in Gulfport, this was a house that was converted into a restaurant.  The front ""lawn"" is a well shaded seating area, plus an indoor room and a patio.  Awesome set-up.  We sat on the patio and had a very relaxing meal.

This menu is fantastic.  So many options, including lots of vegetarian options for my girlfriend.  A lot of the options look delicious, begging you to come back again and again, or just eat yourself sick, whichever you prefer.  I had a hell of a time deciding, but in the end, went with the Wild Wild wrap, which was teriyaki pulled pork, asian slaw, and sirachi.  Right?  How is that tex-mex?  More like, Chinatown-Mex, or  California-mex.  Anyway, I'm glad I did  This thing was fantastic.  A bit on the spicy side, but delicious.  I struggled between scarfing it down because I couldn't get enough, or eating it slowly and savoring it.  Eating slowly never wins with me, so it was gone in 5 seconds.  Oh, but I will be back for more.

I also got a glass of Sangria.  Maybe not the best Sangria ever, but a respectable glass nonetheless.  And, since Yelp has the offer, we also got the chips and salsa for free.  Good - I loved the chips.  The salsa was not the best, but again, still good.  Unfortunately, they don't serve a lot of it with the chips.  They also serve guac with it.  If I ate guac, I probably would have loved it.  My girlfriend enjoyed it.

The new management was hired to ""clean house"" and instead of doing it in a honorable way, they accomplished it with deceit and dishonor.    I know my faults and I am not perfect but I not only was a resident but also an employee.   After my roommate lost his job, my daughters hours were also cut in half.   I asked corporate to allow me time to come up with assistance to catch me up.   I had extremely high electric bills when I had a faulty AC and I was unable to cover everything.   I requested to cash in my vacation and that was denied, so I obtained a part night job and requested vacation to work extra (full time) nights to obtain extra money; that was denied.   So I asked for Monday off for the first of the month to obtain help from agencies which she not only denied but she called me in on my following 2 days off.   By the 4th day the funds were completely exhausted.   I continued working g and witnessed the one director make verbal agreement with residents on payment arrangements and after she left on maternity leave ( which they informed us she was let go and not returning) the new management denied agreements and filed for evictions causing their fees to explode.   The same day I turned on my 2 weeks notice I was told I was being let go and wouldn't have to work the 2 weeks and had until the weekend be completely moved out.   While I was looking for a new place I was informed they reported I was evicted.   When my keys were turned in on August 30th, they lied in court stating I never returned the keys,  admitting to me that if I failed to get a receipt they don't have to admit they received them.    I submitted a printout of a text where the maintenance supervisor acknowledged he turned them in to the director but they asked the judge to not to allow the document as proof.   This company is untrustworthy and preys on its residents.   They refuse to properly fix things that do not work right until you call the city inspector but take you to court for more than what you owe.

We decided to sit outside, on the balcony like area, at 7:45 pm a waitress came over ask us would we like a beverage. We told her that we would like to order our food. She only wanted to focus on drinks. There was a order of alcohol, and a glass of water. At 8:30 pm the drinks were brought back to us. 

At 8:45 pm our waitress walked by us and instantly seated and served a hispanic couple. Within 10 minutes the couple were drinking beverages and side dishes. After 30 minutes it appeared they had there full meal. The manager a male hispanic, came to clear tables behind us, I asked him was anyone going to serve us he acted like he didnt understand english well, and said ok and walked away. 

Soon after I seen the waitress and the manager bringing in 6 men to be seated, between this there were tables being refreshed with water, alcohol, food etc. Never no one came to serve us. 

At this point we knew that we were being racially profiled, and that they were not going to serve us. 

We seen the waitress and had to wave her down finally she came back over to us, we asked her what happened to our food, she replied that the kitchen had lost our ticket. 

I asked could she get her manager because at this time we have been seated for more than 1 hour and why we wasnt informed or why didnt you come back to our table to communicate this with us, just take our orders again. I asked her could I see a Manager, she waked away never returned. 

I got up to find the manager, he instantly told me that the restaurant is full. 

I explained to him we have been here for 2 hours, and no one is helping us. We have watched others be serve. Other guest that were seated vouched for our table, and told him what I was saying was true.

I ordered the combination seafood boil. The one that allows you to select 2 types of seafood (a half pound each). Mom and I love mussels so it was a no-brainer to order the mixture of green and black mussels for the 2 of us. I also got the fried oyster basket which typically comes with fries. I substituted the fries with sweet potato waffle fries instead. No extra charge. Can you believe that? 

Everything was great! Mom really enjoyed getting her hands dirty with this meal. She ate most of the mussels, and I didn't hear a peep out of her until we were done eating. They give you gloves and bibs for takeout orders, but we didn't need to use them. 

My only disappointment was that I didn't see any healthy sides (like some kind of veggie other than corn or cole slaw). The fried seafood baskets have generous portions but it's just too much fried food all at once. The seafood boil on the other hand was fantastic with the garlic butter. They have a number of different seasonings like lemon pepper, cajun, and the hot & crazy sauce. I chose to keep it simple. I thought the sauce went well with the mussels. The 2 red skin potatoes and corn that comes with the boil mixture tasted pretty good with the garlic butter as well. I was blown away by the size of the green mussels. It was a nice and colorful presentation (even in the bag).  I will definitely order it again.

There are now 3 seafood boil places in Brandon. I haven't been to the other 2 yet, but I'm curious to try them out. I have this feeling that Hot N Crazy Crab is better, and I'm basing that on other Yelper reviews. I do hope they are here to stay. This particular storefront of this super old plaza on Bloomingdale & John Moore hasn't had much luck keeping it's tenants. They did a great job of renovating the space and making it more open and inviting. Another good thing is that there are plenty of parking spaces. I'm looking forward to trying more items. Maybe they'll add more veggie sides to the menu later.",2019-08-03 00:15:42

Having a few precious hours with the kids with a sitter for ""date night"" my husband and I really wanted to go somewhere ""grown up"" that we would not have taken the kids.  I'd been eyeing Centro for a while with their appealing cocktail list and menu.  The space is small, but they do their best to create a welcoming space with a mixture of small tables and pub style tables along with an attractive patio space in the back.  The small space is opened up with rollup glass garage style doors.  The interior is generally minimalist with brick, hard surfaces, and dark colors and a large bar/open kitchen space.  The kitchen is certainly a centerpiece/show space with busy attractive staff hustling out food and drinks, the loud club type music adds to the ""cool"" factor of this restaurant.  

The drinks come out quickly and look well crafted.  Flavors didn't live up to the descriptions or appearance, and were surprisingly bland.  (Pims cup and Pisco sour, both fancy dressed up versions but both bland and watery compared to their classic renditions).  

The food was a mixed bag.  We ordered quite a lot. Bread and Spread  $5, Red quinoa falafel $6,  Thai sticky ribs $8, beet salad $6, pulpo a la plancha $14, bread pudding waffle $8 ala mode $3.  

A breakdown on each dish:

The bread and spread was supposed to be warm local bread and the daily spread was some sort of boiled down grapes and a few slices of compound butter.  The bread was not warmed, nor was it fresh.  It tasted at least a few days old and very dry and hard.  It was a deck of cards sized section of some sort of olive bread and two leaves of a Pan d'Epi.  The grape compote was ok, kind of like a halfway jam in a tiny 2 oz ramekin, the compound butter was nice. 

The falafel were good.  I little mealy/mushy inside but tasted as expected.  3 cotton ball sized falafels served in a bowl with a dollop of yogurt and some thinly shredded veggies like cabbage. 

 The ribs were 2 bones of extremely gamey pork deep fried and doused with fish sauce and a ton of sweet chili sauce that tastes exactly like the stuff you get in a bottle.  I think it was served on top of a few thin slices of pickled carrot.  
The beet salad was a lovely composition of red and yellow beets, sliced grapes, queso fresco and a pair of snap peas arranged with dollops of yogurt and some herbal drizzle.  This was the one dish we loved. 

 Pulpo a la plancha was likely the most disappointing.  It was two finger sized tentacles of extremely salty octopus with 2 thin drizzles of sauce and a grilled lemon slice.  Octopus is not an expensive ingredient and the preparation of this dish was not complicated so I'm not sure what warranted the $14 price tag for this three bite dish. It was under the ""dinner"" plates and while I understand this is a small plate concept, I still expected it to be more than 2oz of food.  

The bread pudding waffle literally looked like vomit.  The bananas foster caramel was a mealy looking beige smear and blob.  The flavor was vaguely sweet and ripe bananas but no distinctive rum or brownsugar and spice that is indicative of banana foster.  The gelato a la mode was thin in flavor and a bit icy, not really a rich dense gelato texture.  

so yeah, out of $70 of food and drink we were excited by one $5 dish.  Half the items might have garnered more approval at a much lower price point, and the other half I wouldn't eat for free.  But at least we felt hip while doing it.  ha.  

I would like to say that the look/feel/staffing/and even the logo are all very nice and trendy in a good way.  Even with my lack of enthusiasm for the food/drink, I think this place will still appeal to many for the overall cool factor and good service.",2015-09-12 16:04:44
2aF8cQXmkj68r3kFuNBz3A,KfxFfpYT_0RD7Fa7RVI8Wg,3gXgILE2YWVidJDvVWBT6Q,5.0,4,1,0,"My husband and I both work from home.  So, we grab take out quite a bit, as there is only so many meals a day you can cook all week long.  If it were up to me, breakfast, lunch and dinner would be at the Central Park Family Restaurant in NPR.  Chris  (the owner) and his family, including his beautiful wife and their beautiful baby girl, Sofia, are practically a part of our family and I am certain that every customer they have as ""regulars"" would say the same thing.  Whether you eat there or take out, every single customer is treated warmly, graciously and made to feel like you are a part of their great big Greek family.  For Central Florida and those of you who are natives of New York and New Jersey, the CPC is about as close to those amazing 24 hour Greek diners you know and love back home.  They've been in Pinellas and Hillsborough for years now...but now that they have graced us with their presence here in Pasco?  We could not be happier!  They are literally five blocks from our home and we WOULD eat there around the clock if we could!

Ohhhhh, if ONLY they were open 24 hours.  

Breakfast highlights:  They make THE most amazing home fries you will find any where in Pasco County.  Not greasy, but hot, tasty, crispy and with just the right amount of seasoning.  Eggs?  Any way you want them, you got it.  They are VERY used to taking ""personal requests"" from their customers.  (More on that when we get to ""dinner"").

Lunch highlights:  Their large Greek salads.  Yes, these ARE the greek salads you know and love from up north.  And, they don't use the word ""large"" loosely.  It is a kitchen sink of a bowl full of delicious and fresh greens, various peppers, tomatoes, greek olives, the freshest feta cheese and their to DIE for potato salad.  But the wow factor comes from their home made specialty greek dressing.  It packs a nice punch and will make you want to lick the bowl clean. 
($7.49 for an enormous portion, add chicken or gyro for $2 more).

But for those of you who want a heavier lunch, you have the standard diner fare of Monte Cristo's, delicious wraps, amazing soups (I HIGHLY recommend their split pea soup.  If Linda Blair had this soup in her mouth while filming the Exorcist, she never would have spit it out, thereby destroying one of the greatest moments in cinema history.)   Their chicken lemon rice soup is amazing too and their Navy Bean is like O. M. G.

How about a thick burger like ""The Skyscraper""?  A burger with THREE half pound patties of the best  black angus beef piled high with MEAT CANDY (aka bacon), cheeses, Lettuce, tomato, onion...and whatever other fixings you want to make this one tip the scales at two full pounds of DELISH! ($9.99; add soup AND fries for $1.29 more).

Dinner highlights:  Think comfort foods.  Warm, rich, hearty meatloaf with mashed and a gravy that would make a good ol' southern gal cry from shame that hers could not compare.  The ""Central Park Signature"", a combo of pastrami and corned beef with swiss cheese, grilled onions, some spicy mustard on REAL New York Jewish Rye (is there really any other kind?) $6.89 for this monster sandwich and it comes with soup and fries for that price!  Liver and onions.  Pork chops.  And all the good old Greek specialties, like Gyros and Spanakopita.  

Desserts are insane.  From red velvet cupcakes, to HUGE portions of cheesecakes, specialty greek desserts that rival those down in Tarpon.  Always fresh, always delicious.

But, the best thing of all about CPFR?  The atmosphere.  The easy way the staff all take care of you.  The way all the customers become family if you are there often enough.  The fact that whenever you walk in, Chris and his family are always running some sort of charity event, for Breast Cancer Awareness, for feeding the local homeless, fundraisers for local schools...they are always doing something to give back to the community.  And any time you can get your food with a side order of good karma?

That's a place I want to eat at day and night.

http://www.centralparkfamilyrestaurant.com/Central_Park_Family_Restaurant/Central_Park_Home.html

Make sure to ""like"" them on Facebook to get the daily specials, some coupons and some photos that will make your mouth water.  (Chris and his wife are pretty easy on the eyes too, like a Greek Barbie and Ken! LOL)   And meet their baby, Sophia.  I dare you not to want to pinch those cheeks!

It's very affordable for the enormous portions, it's fun, the place is homey with its NYC decor without overkill,  it's a great place for the entire family and a wonderful asset to the sleepy town of New Port Richey.  The parking lot is always jam packed all day long, but Chris and his staff always manage  to make room for you at his family's table.  7 days a week from 6 am to 8 pm...you have family waiting for you at the Central Park Family Restaurant.

And it always feels like home.",2012-12-09 06:57:39

I came in to use my first session a day before I was leaving on a vacation. I should also preface my review that I've used spray tanning many times before this experience and never had issues. I should have known when the young girl working the salon instructed me to use a wash cloth to ""blend"" the spray when I got out of the bed. I used the booth and got out to find that I had only been sprayed (with what looked like black ink) on my face, chest, hands, back and lower legs. It didn't look right, but I started my ""blending"" with the wash cloth. The solution started drying before I could get to it all and left black streaks down my legs. I panicked, put on a robe and asked the young girl if this was normal. Her advice was to use the excess spray off the doors of the booth to fill in the areas that were streaked my on legs. It of course didn't work. I attempted to wipe the tan off my skin the baby wipes, but with little success. Of course I'm growing increasingly upset, but trying to maintain my composure. The young girl then explained that the bed has had some ""issues"". Her next suggestion was to call her boss and get approval to use the air brush to attempt blending this mess. I was appreciative that she was trying to help me, but on the other hand a spray tan can't usually be fixed. After I was airbrushed the young girl stated that there is a part that they have been waiting for for the booth and said someone would be calling me to follow up. Once I got home and removed my clothes to find a complete smeared, streaked mess, I decided I would attempt a shower to get it all off. Thankfully it came off pretty easily, but what a nightmare. It's not like someone painted my nails the wrong color and could repaint them. The last thing anyone wants is a shitty spray tan and I don't think it could have been any worse! I have yet to hear from the salon about getting a refund or even a discussion with the owner about my dissatisfaction with their salon and tanning booth. I never write reviews, but felt it was extremely important to pass along my awful experience.",2013-11-12 18:33:48
c4vpX-TSLeAvfjyVIthokg,RdJ7Ykelg8w4y5FTmxjT8g,8ZU1N9vxDsJvyBY0fCi4bw,5.0,2,0,1,"My boyfriend and I are always looking to try new places to eat, and we especially like to seek out non-American food.  So we tried Konak, a charming Turkish restaurant tucked away at 2nd and Vine.  It was a cold winter night, and Konak was warm and inviting.  The dining area is large, with cathedral ceilings, which befits the place's name because Konak (pronounced co-naak) means ""mansion"" in Turkish.

My boyfriend and I cozied up at an intimate, candle-lit table across from a party of older folks who seemed to be celebrating someone's anniversary or retirement.  They were a lively bunch, and they made us feel right at home, since they were regulars.  Our server, too, was very friendly and on-the-ball.

The food was even better than the atmosphere.  My boyfriend and I got a flight of Turkish wine samples, all of which were very very good.  I especially liked the red wine because it is dry and smooth.  Turkish food is similar to other Mediterranean cuisine and is just as tasty.  We started off with the skewered mussels and the spicy ezme (a spicy onion, pepper, tomato, and garlic sauce) with flatbread.  My boyfriend then got the Lamb Shish Kebab, which was so tender it was like eating filet mignon (I stole a bite of his dinner), while I dug into a stuffed eggplant.  We ended our meal with Turkish coffee, which is bitter and sweet at the same time, and a dessert special of baked pear stuffed with walnuts and cinnamon.  The dinner was truly worth venturing out into the cold, arctic night.

What made our experience even more delightful was that we happened to go on a night when they had a Turkish band and a belly dancer, which apparently is every Friday.  I was a little embarrassed when the dancer tried to get me to dance with her, but the old men at the table next to us seemed to really enjoy her gyrations.  All in all, this is a classy joint with a genuine Mediterranean flair that is difficult to find in the city.

They also have $2 dishes on Tuesday nights for people seeking to sample Turkish cuisine.  Check out their website for more weekly specials.

There is parking at a lot halfway down the street, and we didn't need reservations the night we went because it was the dead of winter and hardly anyone else was crazy enough to venture outside.  I'd recommend making a reservation if you plan on going at prime dinner hours on the weekend.  I'd also recommend checking out the menu online beforehand, and remember to bring a couple of $1 bills in case the belly dancer is there...",2007-06-29 01:49:45
E-bI7Gd5IwVW-70FEXyYBg,6_oacnOahT1x2a0ic3z3fA,4PzmIUy2sW8zRaobC2vojg,2.0,2,0,0,"I'm not thrilled with this place at all. I had to go there because I like a few blocks away on Delaware and there was no way I was going to be able to take my car too far away, because the brakes were about to fail when the caliper blew out and the brake pads were nonexistent with the rotors needed to be change.

YIKES! Sounds expensive, right? And you better believe it was.

However, the problem I had with them was that they gave me this absolutely ridiculous price estimate and a whole bunch of other things that absolutely HAD to be done. But I'm no fool. I was like there is NO WAY I will be able to afford that. 

Then they decided to tell me an option that was about $300 less and made more sense to the issues that I know what was going on. I understand a lot of auto repair shops do this, but something about this seemed way to unethical for my likings.

My biggest issue though was almost the complete disregard of someone else's time. I first tried to make the online appointment, so I can have one done super early in the morning to have my car done by the time I went to work. I was supposed to be contacted in ""one business hour"" by the store supposedly. Well I waited two days before I decided to call. The problem here is, why is that even an option if they aren't going to call. But I was mostly confused about how they already knew what the reasons were that I was bringing my car in? I don't know seems a little odd.

Anyway, I make a noon appointment and take my car in and was told it would be done in 2-3 hours. I told them that I had to work at 4, so please let me know if anything changes. I get no call back and I walked back to the shop and asked what was going on. Then I had a condescending remark as a reply and then was told it would be done in less than an hour. Therefore, I had to call into work and tell them I was going to be late.

However, once again, absolutely no call and I was walking back to the store and when I'm right outside of it, they decided to call me and tell me they want to keep it overnight. I was LIVID. The problem here is that it takes quite a bit of time for me to walk to work and I was already an hour and a half late. I just couldn't believe they had the audacity to ask me that even after I asked if I should start walking to work or not and I asked about my car being able to stay overnight and they kept shifting the conversation around and didn't give a clear answer.

Also, when I was on the phone, they had the price racked back up and I was like that is not what we talked about earlier and there is no way I can do that. However, I was able to get that down.

So of course, I had to walk to work, I had to stay later to make up the time and had to walk home at 3 am in the pouring rain. I was not happy.

The thing is that I probably wouldn't give them such a low rating, but the whole dodging questions, condescending remarks and the disregard of my time was just so off-putting to me.",2015-11-10 00:55:49

When I first signed up there was a heavy sale, I mean really heavy, on the personal training sessions.  I said ""no"" at the time.  Then I was in there casually working out and one of the trainers, Nate, came up to me and asked me if he could show me some things.  No ask for money to pay for it, just an offer to show me some things.

From there he talked about some options, because I asked, not because he pushed, about personal training.  I signed up that day.  It was his non-pushy approach in the sale that he got one.

Since then, I have been working with Rocky.  He is awesome.  Hands down one awesome trainer.  He listens to my needs and respects my goals (I wanted to just get fit and not huge; I just want to be around when my kids are older).  I am not fat by any means, but I needed a push to get my fitness back to a good point.  

I have weekly 30 minute sessions with Rocky and am glad for the weekly push to get up and get moving.  Being a web designer/nonprofit professional by trade it doesn't give me much time to get active, except the weekends.

Now about the gym itself.  I am giving 5 stars because of the features of the gym.  There are classes happening all the time and they have an app for the iPhone (I don't know about Droid) displaying all of their class schedules.  There is a saline pool to do laps, a room off to the side only for women (so they don't have to feel like they are being watched by everyone in the gym). There are more than enough cardio machines and most of the weight machines are always available.  They have lots of televisions to watch while doing cardio and a side spin classroom and aerobic room for classes.

What is great about this location is also their willingness to watch your kids at no extra cost.  You have to stay on premisses,  but they will keep your kids up to two hours while you work out at no extra cost.  

I am thoroughly impressed by this gym.",2012-10-09 16:51:45

It's Valentine's weekend - so every table had a 'reserved' sign on it. I had been here before when it first opened for lunch. Back then I ordered the olives & fish tacos - I have been dreaming of those fish tacos ever since.
Our waitress, Rachel - was great. She told us that most people order 2-3 tapas items each to share. We ended up ordering:

The olives........I loved the simpleness of the olives last time - so I did it again. It's a nice selection and we nibbled on them throughout the night. (The food comes out as it is ready - not all at once)

Pomegranate Guacamole - this was my husbands choice...I really didn't think it sounded good. Wow! Was I wrong! It was unbelievable and definitely the best guac I've ever had. I really want to try to recreate it. They bring out a big volcanic rock bowl of it -and honestly......we would have licked it dry if we were at home. It was that good!

Tacos - Pork Carnitas - These were really good. The chipotle honey bbq sauce was not too spicy, instead the sweetness really came out. Perfect combination.

Tacos - Flash fried Mahi Mahi - I assumed this was the fish taco I had been dreaming about forever. It was not. Our waitress told us the menu had changed. This fish taco was really good - my husband loved it. I would have loved it too if I wasn't so bummed out that it wasn't the same. But if I had never had the original fish taco - I would have been happy - it was very good!

Black Truffle Flatbread- WOW WOW WOW. This was insanely delicious. I picked this - even though my husband hates mushrooms - but even he agreed - this was a winner.

Spicy Rub Tuna - This was another winner. I usually get a little wary when it comes to mixing fruit with dinner. (like the pomegranate guac) and here it was papaya and tuna.....but wow. I loved this.

now........we should have stopped there because honestly - we were STUFFED. but my husband wanted to try out the New York Strip Steak tacos. That was the only loser of the night. The flavors didn't go together - the onions that were in the middle of the plate were too strong, and the brioche grilled cheese thing wasn't appetizing. BUT - like I said - the only loser of the night.

The margaritas were wonderful.

It was a perfect date night out and I am so happy that my picky husband liked Verdad because he and I rarely agree on restaurants. We can't wait to go back.

My TOP THREE CHOICES THAT I CAN'T WAIT TO GET AGAIN...........
POMEGRANATE GUACAMOLE
SPICY RUB TUNA
BLACK TRUFFLE FLAT BREAD

I would definitely recommend this to any couple or group of friends. I will say - I was happy we sat downstairs. We watched a few people almost fall down the stairs. They must have had too many margaritas.",2011-02-13 15:41:10
cdp6A1S2ScC0N53n0-BncA,A9cXP_K95FRor1qxuUEu2g,lXFpW475fKlACmyyw9_UYA,4.0,8,1,4,"I'd long wanted to try out Love Handle, a rather interesting culinary experience on Mass Avenue that I'm fairly comfortable saying is pretty much unlike anything else you'll experience in the Indy area. The combination of approaching my 700th review AND having an event I was attending downtown earlier this week gave me the time to spend some time on Mass Avenue before the event and finally snag both my Love Handle experience and my 700th review! 

Love Handle has a rather interesting history in that it was a beloved Milwaukee, as in Wisconsin, restaurant until its owners closed up shop and brought the diner with them to Indianapolis. At first, they opened up on East 10th Street and maintained daytime hours that pretty much guaranteed I'd never get the chance to check them out. Finally, however, they took an even bigger plunge and moved a mile or so away to the 800 block of Mass Avenue in the same stretch that includes Homespun, Yats, and other Mass Avenue institutions. While I'm rather notoriously known for not really wanting to pay for parking, I do like this particular block and when I have a couple hours find myself having dinner, checking out Homespun, and heading over to Indy Reads all within a block. 

If you know me, you know I'm not the most adventurous diner. This could have made Love Handle a horrible experience, but the truth is it's planned out really well and despite the uniqueness of their menu it's fairly easy to find something that you'll enjoy. Rest assured, however, that their menu still changes pretty much daily and often times even during the day when they run out of items. For example, they had a tenderloin on the menu the day I arrived. However, it had sold out. 

Love Handle offers such unique meats as tongue, pork belly, beef shoulder, and others along with familiars like fish, tenderloin, etc. that inevitably include unique twists. 

In other words, don't expect to get a burger and fries here. It's just not going to happen. If you have no sense of adventure? This ain't the place for you. Seriously. 

In the move over from East 10th Street, they added alcohol to their menu. They also offer up drip coffee and have some fancy schmantzy soda options. I honestly didn't even check to see if they have iced tea options, though I didn't see any on their chalkboard menu. 

As noted, parking on Mass Avenue is for the most part street parking with the exception of some of the upper scale joints. This means you'll likely pay for a meter. There are accessible spots in each block and appropriate curb cuts. Traffic is a little slower along the 800 block, though if you park along the street and you're getting a wheelchair out of your car you'll want to be aware of your surroundings. I had very little difficulty. The best way to get to Love Handle is to find one of the inclines up to their sidewalk - for example, along the Yats entrance you can gain easy access. The front door is fairly workable and the interior of Love Handle easily accommodates accessibility needs with the exception of a small diner/barstool area that's not particularly wheelchair friendly. 

As has been noted, they play movies on their wall - I'm not sure what was playing the evening I dined here. Silverware is on the table. You order at the counter, pay, and they bring the food to you. 

I ordered a 1/2 order of spicy biscuits and gravy. I skipped the egg on top. With my coffee, my bill came in at about $10. 

There's little question that the interior decor leans toward a casual hipster vibe. It's trendy but not obnoxious. It's pretty warm and comfortable. Being early in the evening hour, there wasn't much of a crowd. A handful of folks came in to pick up orders while I was present and it seemed like a couple regulars were lingering. Everyone was super friendly and the menu was explained quite nicely. 

I honestly wasn't sure about the food. While I stayed fairly basic, it was quite good and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again. It's a tad on the pricy side, but the serving size was decent and I left satisfied. 

I understand both sides of the review spectrum here. If you're an experimental diner with a love for unique experiences, you have to absolutely at least respect what's going on here. I also admire integrity - I always kind of hate it when a restaurant pretends to be unique, but then has a handful of menu items that cater to simple Hoosier tastes. Love Handle is what it is - you'll probably love it or hate it. 

I do, however, understand why it's not for everyone. The unique foods, hipster decor, and lack of predictability certainly won't work for everyone. While I enjoyed it, it's also not a place I would ever argue over. 

It didn't quite achieve a 5-star level for me. The food was good, but didn't grab me at a ""I have to go back tomorrow"" level. I felt the same about the experience. For me, this was a ""once in a while"" experience that I'm glad I had but would probably not be my first choice even in this block.",2019-05-04 02:46:50

1) the girl at the front desk was outstanding. She needs to go to an upscale hotel and work there instead. Just saying I forget her name (my hubby thinks it was Tonisia or something like that). 
2) Free Parking.
This is why they got ONE star. LOL

Now the bad:
1) Our door was broken (the lock so anyone could walk in. We had to contact them to fix it.
2) the tub was FILTHY. The bottom was black... and the tub was white.  Some other crusty stuff on the drain. The drain did not drain. It was backing up. Other fungus on corners 
2) the bed was the most horrendous I've ever slept in. It was like a 99 dollar mattress. It felt like I was sleeping on a cheap box spring. The mattress squeaked if you moved an inch. It was SOOOO loud.
3) there was trash on the floor left in the room
4) there was NO MAID SERVICE. No, I did not have a card on my door. Trash cans then were overflowing... 
5) there was NO PADDING on the bed. Basically, you were sleeping on what others did... GROSS
6) Sheets were soooo flimsy you could see right through them. Thread bare.
7) there were NO amenities in the bathroom.  One bar of soap? I had to go to Walmart to get conditioner and lotion. I'm not used to staying places were there's no conditioner at least. I NEED conditioner.
8) No coffee pot.  We found out you could get one. So she went back and got one. Nice of her but no cups?  Went back for cups and coffee. No cream/sugar, spoons or stirrers.  Had to ask for those too~
9) No ice or snack or drink machines anywhere but in the lobby. So if you were thirsty in the middle of the night, you had to go down.
10) Wi-Fi was free. But could not get it to work on the laptop.  
11) Elevator was broken. Second and only other elevator sounded like it had issues and up in the ceiling of it was a mouse or bug trap? GROSS
12) Lobby was run down, not homey and institutional looking.
13) The room had wood floors...NOT. Not wood. Not laminate. Not tile that looks like wood. VINYL and my feet touched it and it was sticky and gross.  I put my shoes on which squeaked.
14) Hallways were institutionalized and hall had same plastic thing on the floor from when we got there till we left.
15) The laminate counters, no chair, light wouldn't turn out till you tried it three times... cheap cabinets. Only good thing in the room was the TV.  Everything else looked like from the 80s.  
16) It's not  within walking distance of anyplace to eat, does not have a gift shop or place to buy anything.

I'm sure I could think of more stuff like the towels were frayed... but that would be picky

Yes, I'm a little picky. I am used to better places. But for 211 a night, you'd think I'd be somewhere better? I stayed at a Residence Inn in Crystal City, VA which is just in DC... and for 50 bucks less a night I stayed in a GORGEOUS suite, top floor, corner room with all updated furnishing, separate bath and bedroom, all granite and great beds and gorgeous looking hotel inside out.  This was a DUMP. I would have never known by the online photos how bad this was.  I had to choose it. The only other room in the whole city/area of Philly was booked except one for 59 a night. IMAGINE how that was. Probably sleeping with rats and roaches.


This hotel should be SHAMED for charging us 211 plus takes (almost 250 in the end) per night.  I hope I spared others from staying here.",2015-09-30 17:38:32

We bought a sofa from this store, and chose to pick it up at the store ourselves, because they wanted $99 for delivery. However, they charge $20 just to have the furniture delivered TO THEIR STORE for you to pick up! Ok, whatever.
We got a phone call saying that the sofa would be delivered to the store the next week, and it would be available then. So we sold our old couch in anticipation and had nowhere to sit. When we called Mealey's to check a few days later, they said no, in fact, it wouldn't be delivered to their store when they said, and they did not give a reason. They just said that it was supposed to be on the truck and now it isn't on the truck. It's coming from Morrisville. It shouldn't be this giant complicated logistics operation. So we asked to speak to a manager. I don't know what their store policy is, but it must be **nobody speaks to the manager no matter what, ever!**. I think it would probably be easier to get Donald Trump to tweet at me than it would be to get a Mealey's manager on the phone. Seriously. Try it. They will NOT let you talk to a manager. How are you supposed to get your concerns addressed when the people who answer the phone won't help you? 
So, fast forward, we finally pick up our sofa from the store. We bring it home, and really all you have to do is put the feet on the sofa, they screw in- like any other sofa I've ever owned. Easy, right? Wrong! The holes were not aligned with where you put the feet in. So currently, we have 3 of the 4 feet in the sofa and the sofa is up on its side while we wait for someone from ""service"" to get off their break and help us. You think somebody will come from Morrisville to our house to fix this? I don't. Yes, they can probably blame the manufacturer, however, they're the ones who choose to sell furniture made by whomever, so they are to blame for all of this. Oh, also, there is this random piece of wood screwed into the bottom, that I think was put there for shipping. The screws got stripped and now it won't come out! Yeah!
The only bright spot in this whole mess was our saleswoman, Val. She was so helpful when we bought the sofa. If you decide to gamble and buy something from this horrendous store, we suggest at least asking for Val.",2017-03-04 17:07:47

The store front is deceiving, as the inside of the restaurant is pretty spacious for the number of tables they have. I can't decide if I'd describe this place as a Latin breakfast spot with American dishes, or an American breakfast spot with a Latin twist. The menu offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner listing your typical French toast, pancakes, burgers, etc. There is a separate menu insert offering other dishes such as tacos, quesadillas, and pupusas! 
We walked in as a party of 5 around 10:30-11:00 am and were seated immediately; there was only one party of 2 currently seated. The host/server/manager (he worked all 3 roles), who also speaks Spanish (I believe he said he's Salvadorian) greeted us and let us choose our seats. The menu was a bit overwhelming with options, but it could also be because I was so hungry and everything sounded delicious! There is a small selection of imported beers and wines. I started with a mimosa, which for $6 wasn't too bad. Our group ordered the meat lovers skillet, banana and Nutella French toast, steak and avocado omelet, country fried steak, and my order, which was the 3 tacos combo with 2 chorizo and 1 asada. 
By the time our food came out, parties ranging from 2 to 8 people trickled in and filled more than half the restaurant! And the food was just as expected, AWESOME! My tacos came with 2 choice sides, so my plate had 3 tacos loaded with onions and cilantro, refried beans, and rice with green salsa and habanero sauce on the side. It was FILLING. They were definitely generous with the meat portions. I could barely finish my last taco but I forced myself - that's how yummy. The asada was tender and moist. The chorizo was a bit burnt and crunchy in some spots but otherwise super tasty. My brother and dad finished all of their skillet and country fried steak, including the sides of biscuits and gravy that came with their entrees. The only downside to everything and reason I had to deduct a star was that both my mother and sister found hairs in their entrees.. However, we brought it up with the server and he apologized, offered us another entree (we declined), and removed the dishes from our bill. 
Overall we had stellar service and delicious food. I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt about the hair situation, and would definitely recommend this place to others passing through like we were!",2020-01-04 02:16:22

Even though I really wanted to say that I'd go across to World Market and we'd meet up later, I decided to go with him. Ugh, big mistake. He was looking for a specific brand of router. We were looking and looking and looking. About 55 employees saw us and no one offered to help. One employee finally came over and we told him what we were looking for. He said he didn't know if they still carried that brand and stayed looking at us. I stared back thinking, ""Well, can you go find out?"". He left and we continued looking on our own. Another employee came about 10 minutes later (since he had been practically right next to us this whole time). We asked him the same thing and he said they no longer carried that brand and showed us which one had replaced it. 
I don't mess with the computer stuff . . . that's my husband's territory, so he chose that brand instead and said he'd research it then choose whether to keep it or return it. 
As we were paying, a man walked out of the store and the alarm beeped. A lady at the door yelled at him ""SIR, I NEED TO SEE YOUR RECEIPT"". We all looked over, but he came back in and showed his receipt. Then we walked out. It rang again and rather than have her yell at me, I stepped right back. My husband showed her the box with the router and the receipt. She said, ""Then it's HER"" as she pointed at me. I said it wasn't me because I wasn't carrying any merchandise. Now, here you must know that one of my pet peeves is when people tell you something they assume as though it's a fact. That makes me cringe every time. She said, ""Then you bought something else and have it in your purse"". -cringing- Again, I said no and she looked about ready to look in my purse. Having nothing to hide, I opened it. She said ""Then you have a security device sewn into the inside of your purse"". This whole time she'd been using a really loud voice and people were staring at us like someone was about to get busted, namely us. I assured her there was no security device and I'd actually been to stores, plenty of them, with this exact same purse (my favorite Dooney). We told her it was probably the router and she started yelling ""IT'S HER! I KNOW IT'S HER!!"", again pointing at me. She wanted to prove it and demanded that I walk back through the sensors. I did and it did NOT ring. My husband told her to swipe the router box on that thingy that deactivates the alarms on merchandise (because she had been refusing to, swearing it was me). She swiped it and the thing beeped indicating it was barely now deactivated. She then had the nerve to say, ""Oh, sorry for the confusion"". Uh, yeah . . . WE weren't confused. People were passing by and shaking their heads like they couldn't believe it. The only satisfaction I got was seeing her face turn a violent shade of red as I stared daggers at her. I wonder if I could return things out of spite there. . . . Seinfeld style.",2010-07-06 03:23:17

-Kung Pao Vegetables: While I am not normally one to take to grilled celery, the kung pao sauce and peanut combination was a great take on this dish.
-Peruvian Potatoes: FIRE! Honestly, most aji amarillo that I had in Peru did not have a very strong flavor, but this aji, married with peanut and pepper, was a nice, spicy spin on potatoes. We were both practically sopping up the sauce with the potatoes. Mmmmm
-KFT Tacos: This dish was the least remarkable for me, and the radish kimchi tasted much less pickled than normal radish kimchi (which I'm actaully totally fine with). 
-Spicy Dan Dan Noodles: You can taste the sichuan pepper in these, and it is a great addition to the menu! 
-Falooda: This was the star of the show for sure! Typically a dessert associated with some parts of India, it featured pistachio ice cream (which was absolutely perfect and didn't taste too much of pistachio--a positive), basil seeds that almost look like tiny boba on top, sweetened milk, and probably something that is mildly addictive in there because I could have easily had four of these. The flavor combination was rich and each part was highly complementary of the others. Yesssss

They also had a ""Kisi"" Georgian wine, which I ordered and they asked if I wanted to try first. While I've had other Georgian skin contact wines before, each of them can be a very different experience and all tend to be bold and distinctive. I was not in love with the Kisi, mainly due to the flavor left on the palate after the wine is actually consumed. All that said, I switched to the West of Kyoto, which has Japanese plum whisky and banana cognac (you read that right, but it actually doesn't taste like banana at all) and was quite refreshing. I also enjoyed the Summer Gold cocktail, a sherry-based drink with tepache (Mexican fermented pineapple beverage), and some other great things. 

Service was friendly and attentive, and I felt like the dishes were coursed at just the right times. I would totally be down to come back here again, and given that there menu is highly seasonal, I'd be able to try loads of new dishes. 

Take a bow, V Street. Well done.",2019-06-02 01:12:17

But luckily, our handy dandy Yelp apps let us know that IOU was right nearby. Tucked into a big ole plaza, it's a little bit hard to find next to the urgent care. 

Upon first glance, it seems a little sparse inside. We were here around 2 on a Sunday, and it was not at all busy. It was a little odd because we weren't greeted when we walked in, nor was there any signage, so we had to just kind of assume that we should seat ourselves. Overall, we received pretty lackluster service, with the server only visiting us two or three times overall despite being one of the only tables. 

We were eyeing the specialty rolls, but those unfortunately are only served in the evenings. Weird move, but okay. We each got the lunch special that came with our choices of temaki, two pieces of nigiri, and maki. I had the unagi nigiri, selena hand roll, and crystal shrimp roll. The unagi was really really good, melt-in-your-mouth good, but took about 20 minutes to come out? Way later than the rest of my food. The selena hand roll was good, with a very flavorful spicy tuna. Also, the serving size on that bad boy was gigantic. The crystal shrimp itself was tasty, but I think putting it inside of a roll was not the best application; it was a little too dry and the ratios were off between shrimp and rice, so the flavor was a little bit diminished--I ended up just picking out the pieces of shrimp and only eating those. 

The fella had the snapper nigiri, honor temaki, and rainbow roll. He said that the snapper was excellent, and was also impressed by the size of the hand roll and enjoyed that too. The rainbow roll was weird... not bad, necessarily, just not a rainbow roll. All of the fish were just smashed together inside of the maki roll rather than the traditional pieces of fish laying on top. We also got a spam musubi to split, because it's one of my favorite snacks ever (don't judge me, spam is disgusting but goddamn amazing and you know it). This musubi was just not good. It had a HUGE cut of spam, but that's not really a good thing in this case? There was probably 3x as much spam as there was rice, which meant it was crazy salty. Also, it wasn't cooked really so it was still a weird kinda pale color that was not at all appetizing to look at. There was no sauce on it, either, so really it was only the taste of a giant hunk of spam. Definitely would pass on that next time around. 

The prices were okay considering how much food you get, and the food overall wasn't bad, but I'm not really sure we'd come back unless it's in a pinch.",2018-10-16 17:28:49

Listen to the reviews on here and Google; the reviews are exceptionally bad for a reason. For one, they sell oil at the most expensive price among any of their competitors. I had a fuel oil bill a couple of months ago that was $800+ for just one month, and I came to find they were charging almost $3.70+ a gallon at that time, whilst their competitors (Bucks County Fuel Oil, Patriot HVAC, JC Heating and Cooling, etc.), were charging around $2.60 maximum per gallon. Also, I needed my oil burner cleaned, and they wanted $726 for it. I kid you not... $726. I called every other company that services my town and the range I got was $150 to $290 MAXIMUM. Not a single competitor was charging even half of what they were charging at maximum (again, Patriot HVAC, Horizon Services, etc.). They stated that this is a flat rate that they charge to clean ANY boiler, so a person with a 6,000 sq ft home with a much larger boiler will be paying the same price as me with a 1,600 sq ft home with a much smaller boiler. I will be doing my absolute best to convince people not to use this company and to make the switch so that their wallets can thank them! By the way, their ""contracts"" are something like $490 yearly AT THE CHEAPEST TIER, again, when competitors' contracts maxed out at about $300 yearly altogether when I called around. Not to mention their staff is in unknowledgeable and I called just to ask for the price of a fuel pump replacement. They transferred me back and forth from sales to service about 3x and then told me they couldn't give a price over the phone and that someone would need to come out and look at it. When I asked for a ballpark, they said they'd transfer me to a ""supervisor"" and my call was ""dropped"" during the transfer. Forget the horrible customer service, their prices alone should be enough to make you absolutely run away! If you are using this company for your fuel oil needs and you are in Bucks County, PLEASE RUN FAST! Nearly any competitor of theirs that you go with will save you thousands per year! I am hoping that as I speak to more homeowners among my family and friends, I can bring my insanely high bills to their attention and convince them to make the switch from Meenan to pretty much ANY other company.",2018-04-20 10:23:37

Such an establishment is Bertha Miranda's. You've got to figure if a Mexican restaurant has survived for twenty years through the ups and downs of the Reno economy, it must have something going for it. In this case it is good food and a charming ambiance. The large comfortable chairs appear to be handmade with the name Bertha Miranda tooled into the brown leather. The walls are covered by surreal paintings and on the Friday night we were there a musician was strumming his acoustic guitar pleasantly, keeping the volume low enough to allow conversation.

By now you are probably thinking, ""What about the food?"" so without further adieu I'll get to that. I had something called ""The Hat"" which is a a large deep-fried flour tortilla filled with the usual tostada ingredients: your choice of chicken, pork carnitas, ground or shredded beef and lettuce, tomatoes, Monterey Jack cheese, sour cream and guacamole. The Hat is accompanied by rice and your choice of re-fried or pinto beans. Both sides (I had the re-fried frijoles with my rice) were excellent. The portion of the flavorful shredded beef I picked was large enough to satisfy on a day when I'd skipped lunch and the guacamole tasty enough to cause me to make a mental note to order it next time with the tortilla chips that are served while you are waiting for your meal. Incidentally I read an earlier reviewer complaining of being charged for a second bowl of chips but we were not charged for a second serving. My only quibble on the chips is they aren't served warm. Two of the other people in my party who had been to the restaurant before had the chimichanga, and reported it good but not up to the quality of some of the other selections. The margaritas, served in a pint-sized Mason jar with a handle were excellent. We'd taken Amtrak up through the marshmallow world of the Sierra in January so we were car-less and although it isn't that far from the casino area, the combination of snow and a somewhat questionable area to walk in after dark made us decide to take a taxi. Pleasantly the fare on the meter was only $3.88.",2010-01-26 09:44:14
fhKQAS0Kjlxlugr_1j8kJA,h1EH6WI24ImfGMT5SJACxg,pPt-SacmIxD6ZbEXY0Pv1g,1.0,9,1,0,"This place is a joke!!!! They act like it's luxury living and sure is pricey enough to seem like it is but isn't. They've given us problems since before we even moved in. We came to check them out and were given a tour, shown a unit and they gave us $100 off rent and a move in special but as soon as we we said yes to the apartment she gave it away to the people sitting across the room from us. Why would you show us something and get is excited about t if you are showing to someone else at the same time and won't even give us the same offer for the same room? So we waited over a month for another unit to be available and when it did we weren't given any specials what so ever, in fact they gave us the wrong move in date so when I gave my month notice to my current residence we were forced to almost pay double because our contracts overlapped. On top of that, there's never any parking! And they don't allow guests to visit without a parking pass which they also won't give me. On top of that, when we first moved in there's a hole in the ceiling, a broken doorbell, broken AC unit, knicks and scratched all over the walls and floors, crappy paint job on sinks and shower made to look nice but chips once water gets to it. They don't even have normal creamer for the coffee they provide, it's powdered creamer. Then, these random maintenance guys kept coming in and out of our house to fix the AC whenever they wanted, they didn't follow appointments, they showed up on our days off and gave no notice and just walked in, this happened over five times, which is BS, it doesn't take six different people, five different times to fix an AC. And how can you just show up whenever you want and not notify the tenants thats called lack of privacy or I make an appointment and they don't even show up. Especially when I have a cat. 

Then on top of that, our crappy neighbors apparently took a picture of a trash bag I left outside my door for an hour while I was cleaning up my apartment on my day off and tattled on me to the front office as if I'm some slob. The front office called two days later while I was working just to tell me I'm in the wrong. They didn't even bother to look to see if there was any trash outside my doorstep but instead left me a ridiculous voicemail stating that I'm not allowed to leave things outside my door and I have to throw it away immediately. The trash was there for an hour, get over it. It's nice to know I have snobby nosy neighbors. People leave couches, bed frames, big boxes and random other stuff outside but god forbid me leaving a trash bag outside for an hour. One of the tenants even had a Pod taking up two parking spaces right by my apartment but for some reason that was allowed for over three days. My apartments don't ever having parking as it is but for some reason they allowed an entire Pod to take two spaces for days. 

This place has crappy communication, they cheaply fix things, they don't clean the outside area of the buildings at all. And apparently they won't actually call me when they are supposed to to let me know when they are coming by to fix something but instead they only call to bitch at me about small stuff that don't even matter when they could be fiXing the problems. Pathetic! 

Yea they have nice pool with late hours and a hot Tub, sauna and small fitness section but that's the only good part. They still won't even tell me the code for the gates, still won't tell me how to use the theatre area or cycle area, and never leave pool sticks out to play pool and lock the clubhouse over night so I can't even get coffee really early in the morning or even get a snack from the vending machine. And the sauna never really even heats up. 

To even top it all off yet again, this stupid place doesn't even have recycling, so all the plastics and compost from the entire community will just be thrown into the ground and rot away all because they are too cheap to pay for recycling.",2019-04-06 01:03:37

But my buddy loves poker and isn't into the ""traditional"" bachelor party activities. I emailed every single casino in Edmonton and this was the only place that offered private function tournaments. I was in contact with Jason who runs the poker room and he was very helpful and made sure we were taken care of. Wehad to book 4 weeks in advance and could only have a maximum of 30 players at only $10 a head to reserve! I couldn't believe it was so cheap I had to keep asking as I thought I misunderstood. Jason emailed me a few days before to assure me everything was still a go and get a list of players. A few of the guys had to back out due to work but since we still had enough for 2 tables he gave me a refund for the spots I paid for that couldn't come!
The room was a big space that was upstairs away from the noise of the main hall. We had a private screen that showed our time, blinds and winning pot. We were even able to choose our own buy ins for the game and prize deals! There was full waitress service throughout the whole tournament. They could have come around more often but they were also serving the rest of the casino so its understandable. The dealers were great. for myself and a few other guys having never played before they were very patient and helpful as to explaining the rules and cards. 

Near the end of the game a band was starting downstairs and we happened to be right above the stage so It got a little too loud that we couldn't really hear eachother when we talked which was kind of annoying. And I do have to agree with people saying the place could really use an updated facelift and the waitresses outfits were a little weird. But everything was clean and the bathrooms are all new so it didn't damper our experience at all.

Overall if you're looking for a great private party venue I would highly recommend this place. even the most experienced gamblers in our party were impressed by the level of service and quality overall. Even scheduled in smoke breaks throughout the game. Thanks so much to Jason and everyone who helped give my buddy an awesome bachelor party. We'll definitely be back!!",2014-08-04 03:44:30

If this review was for any other visit i would have given it a 5. This visit was a whole different experience. We were looking for a place to eat yesterday and called la scala and they said the wait was going to be 30 mins, but they were not taking reservations. We got there and were bombarded by 10 people waiting in the entrance. We learned they were all waiting for take-out food. So we were immediately seated. We waited about 5-10 minutes for a server to come up to us, but there were about 2-3 workers standing right next to us the whole time. When our waitress came up she was extremely nice and pleasant. We placed our order, and the waitress brought our drinks. We ordered the alicia's sunday dinner, fire wings, la scala fries, and grandma's pie. We waited around 45 minutes before any food came. This was of no fault of our waitress who was extremely nice and brought us some bread to snack on. We were sat next to the open kitchen so we could see what was being cooked and sent out. The whole time we were there take-out orders were continuously being sent out, and the dine-in plates were few and far in between. While we were waiting we had multiple wait staff and a manger standing next to us on their phones and chatting. It seemed as if they had too much wait staff and not enough people in the kitchen, and the manager was not tending to the tables to see if they were okay. If I was a manager at a restaurant where patrons were waiting 45+ minutes for food I wouldn't be on my phone and I would be checking on the tables and assuring their experience was a pleasant one. If this was my first experience I would never come back. 

The food and our waitress on the other hand was great. Our waitress was so nice and checked on us repeatedly. The food was also delicious. Everything tasted amazing and I was so happy.

Overall, I was extremely dissatisfied with this experience, and I don't know if I will return to this restaurant during COVID. I do want to reiterate it was not due to the food or our waitress!",2020-12-07 04:37:35

This is my very first review and its a shame that its mostly negative. I live 45 minutes outside of the city and took my wife out to Farmicia for her birthday dinner, hoping for a lovely romantic night, what we got was one of the worst meals I've ever had. Farmicia was highly recommended by a friend and we had heard it was from the same person  who created White Dog Cafe, which is a favorite, so I was very surprised that we got an 8pm reservation for a Saturday when I made the reservation just a day before. We soon found out why this was so easy. Smiles greeted us at the door but we were soon put in the far back corner of the restaurant. Other tables were available so we found it funny we were put in the in the table which was quite cramped, uncomfortable and under a bright spot light. Still hoping for the best our waitess came to the table, and semi-pleasant and not over charmingly asked, ""ya ready yet?"". Less than classy, but an acceptable attitude to me, although my wife found it off putting when we had to ask what the specials were. She was average, and kinda going through the motions. We split the cheese plate which was really fantastic and now we were excited for the rest of the meal. But the rest of the meal wasn't what we'd hoped for and rivaled a cafeteria buffet. My salad was simple, lacked presentation, and dressing tasted like it was straight from the bottle. My wife found her pear and crab salad mediocre, with crab just slopped on and lacking flavor.  What topped every thing off was when my steak arrived, it was slapped down on some mashed potatoes, with a side of kale that was so overcooked it was almost disintegrating. But the kicker of my $28 ""entree"" was the steak; amazingly unevenly cooked medium rare on the inside, totally red rare on the edges, over tenderized, and barely warm. Barely warm was strange because our meal came out fast. Was it sitting a long time? It was it a left over? Not sure? Never the less, I've had better steak in a school lunch line. My wife's gnocchi was less than spectacular, mushy and over seasoned with so much pepper it was hard to eat. It was if they lathered seasoning on because the food itself was so bland. And also completely lacking in presentation. It was shocking how our food was just slopped on the plate.  My wife said something to the waitress about how unhappy we were and the girl offered free desert for us both but even with her insatiable sweet tooth my wife amazingly declined. That's something I've never seen before, and this meal accomplished just that.
The decor, the mixed drink, olive oil bread, and cheese were the only things worth mentioning that were positive. The rest; not including a $150 tab, is something I would expect from a mis-managed Sizzler.",2013-03-06 13:08:32

If any of you are like me, someone who frequented Obie's on Elliston Place but moved away prior to about 2001, you will be disappointed because the current Obie's pizza and the old Obie's pizza having nothing in common at all. You can get your hopes up because the place has the same name and is in the same location and is almost the same looking from the outside and practically identical in the inside (so much so it's like walking into a time-warp).

I grew up on Obie's pizza and started coming as a baby in the 1980s. My parents were Obie's fanatics and were always there from the time it first opened in about 1979. The originator of the place was a young guy who was killed unexpectedly shortly after it opened. Obie's changed hands many times after that but the new operators always remained true to the original recipe. The place was called Obie's Flying Tomato Pizza back then. They served thin crust, pan, and deep dish Chicago style pizzas.

All of us were such Obie's lovers that even though we moved away in the early 90's when any of us came back to Nashville we'd always bring several pizzas back on the plane (when you were allowed to do that sort of thing) for the rest of the family. The last time I did that was about 2001. A year of so after that we got a call from my aunt to forewarn us that Obie's had changed owners yet again and this time the pizza changed too.

I decided to stop by recently even though I'd been told by other family who checked out the change not to go because there is no way I would like it they said. I couldn't resist the temptation. The owner was there and I just came out and asked him if his pizza was anything at all like the original Obie's. He said he wouldn't know because he never had the original Obie's but to please go ahead and try his. He also said the current Obie's pizza was a recipe he created. So we ordered and I found that the pizza wasn't bad; I thought it was just okay judging it objectively not comparing it to the original. My aunt was with me and was surprised that the recipe had changed yet again from when she was there in about 2007.

At the end of our meal the owner asked me if his Obie's pizza tasted anything like the original. I told him it tasted nothing at all like the original but was still decent pizza which was the truth and he seemed happy with that.

If anyone out there happens to know the recipes for the ORIGINAL (circa 1979 - 2000) Obie's Flying Tomato deep dish and pan pizzas let me know!!",2010-10-15 19:50:30

I know Clayton is nice and consists of a very critical crowd, so I thought this was a good choice.  Since I've never been, I was just paired with a stylist because I did not recommend anyone.  I don't know if he was new or what the situation, but I left not happy.  I called specifically to ask if they could cut my hair dry. They said they could, and also mentioned it as soon as I sat down.  I went from relatively long hair to short, because I wanted all of the dead/processed hair completely gone. I asked for a dry cut because I know that hair shrinks up after drying, and I was asking for a bob which requires precision.  I had also asked for a treatment but wasn't sure which one would be best for my hair and my needs.  My stylist put some small packet of something in my hair, didn't leave it in my hair for long at all, didn't put me under the dryer, and didn't even explain to me what is was.  Once it was rinsed, he told me he was going to cut the length off while it was wet and then finish the cut when it was dry, which I agreed to.  He did the entire cut when it was wet and had me facing the opposite side of the mirror so I couldn't see.  I was really upset about that. While he was cutting, I was asking any recommendations to help my hair grow back healthy and faster.  The only recommendation was vitamins....obviously.  I came in expecting to spend a lot of money on a nice treatment, cut, and possibly hair products if he had offered, and I got none of that.  It was like he didn't know what he was doing at all.  Not only that, but after he finished my whole cut, he told me he was not able to make it like the picture because my hair is too thick.  Why wouldn't he have told me that before so I could have altered it? Now it has no shape and I am going to keep having to shape it as it grows which is only going to make me have shorter hair for a longer period of time (which I didn't want). 

I only cut my hair because it was so dead it was becoming unmanageable, so I knew I had to go short regardless if I wanted to or not, but he did not make the experience a good one at all.  This salon could have gained an awesome client who would've spent a lot of money on products and treatments monthly, but unfortunately they did not.

I also was not offered a drink when walking in, and the atmosphere was cramped and didn't feel like a ""spa"" at all.

My sales man William was fantastic! And Carlos the manager was good as well. First let me start by saying it should have been delivered yesterday. In which I took the day off of work for. Got the confirmation call the night before with the time slot 3-6pm. With a call ahead of 40 min. By 5:45 hadn't got a call yet. So I called them. I was told as it turns out the appliances were not picked up from Clearwater for the transfer. So no delivery was being made. So I agreed to just pick them up. Apon arrival to the store, I was greeted by Mason whom informed me they had been picked up and were in Orlando. There was no room on the delivery truck. He made arrangements to have delivered today. Now keep in mind I purchased open box specials, dishwasher, refrigerator & range. These items were store displays. Fridge had cosmetic damage on sides, no biggie it would be covered by cabinets. The range & dish washer were in excellent condition. No cosmetic damage would be seen after installation. But upon arrival there were scratches in the front of the range, dishwasher & fridge. I inspected them on the truck. They had no plastic wrapping of any sort. Moving blanket was it. No inspection stickers from Clearwater departure. Driver showed me the pics of damages he uploaded prior to leaving Orlando. I called the store and was given the run around. ""That damage was there"" "" the driver must have removed the inspection stickers"" ""you can bring them back and pay an upcharge for updated items"" these things were told to me by Brian a manager.....So Brian was going to email the pictures that were taken at the store before going to Orlando. And the damage sheet identifying the damages. After waiting over an hour for the email, I called back. And oddly enough he said he sent to pics. But They are unable to locate the damage report. He said you can even see me in the pic with the fridge. So that was at time of delivery, NOT in the store! I get that I got a GREAT price on the items I purchased. BUT this is sad way to do business.

I am out of nearly $1,000. and they deny that they had anything to do with an aftermath of leaks which followed a declogging event in the bathroom. The guy tore a chunk of wall behind the vanity sink and left a really nasty mess for me to clean. They alleged they fired him. Had another guy come out to inspect what the former employee had done..etc had him look at new leak in garage where washer is (i had tried to fix it myself & apparently did a good job because it stopped leaking just as he went to check it out). When he left, I found that I could not find my plumbing tape spool  which i left on the washer....gave him the benefit of the doubt still cannot find it. Anyway, more issues developed and they sent yet another guy out. I found more leaks in the bathroom which never had occurred before. Now leaking behind that same wall.Had the spout replaced & was lead to believe this would resolve the leaking issue and was charged $195. It continued to leak as this plumber was leaving & immediately told him. His reply was border line nasty & said he stopped the leak from behind wall & not there to repair any add'l leaks.   He had already left when I discovered that my new spout I purchased from Lowes was missing. They sent another plumber, Mike, who was the nicest of them all. He said All leaks were unrelated & that I needed a repair where the single handle on tub is for $285. Brought me a spout and I quickly pointed out it was not the one the other guy took without my permission. He had placed an inferior one instead in my tub. Long story short. They mailed me a check for it which was not signed so I had to drive all the way to Ybor City in a very nasty neighborhood (I am a petite woman) and have them sign it.

I came here on September 1st with my amazing girlfriend for my 24th birthday. And we both REALLY enjoyed our food A LOT!!! However, there were a few issues that we had with the service while dinning here...

We walked in for our 7pm reservations and were quickly seated.

We then had 2 different male waiters come up to our table at different times, we weren't quite sure who our waiter was and that made it a little confusing. Both of our waiters worked in the bar that night, both were Hispanic. Anyway, one of the two male waiters came up to us and asked if we would like anything to drink and any appatizers. I said, ""yes"" and then pointed at which red pinot noir I wanted. He then pronounced the name and then went to go grab it and also put in our appetizer order. But when he came back with the pinot noir, it was the wrong one, it was a white wine. I asked him if this was the pinot noir that was under the red wine selection, and he said, ""oh sorry, I thought you wanted a different one."" I said, ""no, I wanted this one."" and then pointed to the pinot noir that I originally pointed at... lol. He then went and grabbed the right one.

A few minutes went buy and our appetizer came out. Keep in mind that we have not ordered our main course dish. We have been sitting down for about 20 minutes and not one of our two waiters had come to ask us what we wanted to order for our main dish.... Anyway, our appetizer was dropped off, which tasted ok. We ordered the Carpaccio. We finished most of the Carpaccio, and noticed that our waiter had not asked us what we wanted to order for our main dish. So I had to verbally call over one of our two waiters to tell him what we wanted to order. He asked us what we wanted, however, he didn't write anything down, which made me a little worried that he was going to put our order in wrong, since there was already a few issues with the service during our meal.

While we were waiting for our main dish to come out, one of our two waiters brought over some bread for us to snack on while we waited. I asked the waiter if he could bring over some Balsamic Vinaigrette to go with the oil. He said sure and kindly brought it over. The bread tasted AMAZING lol me and my girlfriend both love bread lol.

We finished the bread and the waiter asked if we would like some more, which we said yes to. But before the waiter walked away, I asked if he could bring over some more of the Balsamic Vinaigrette. He said, ""Yes"". But when he walked back to our table with the new plate of bread, he forgot the Balsamic Vinaigrette... lol at this point I was getting a little frustrated because of the continuous messing up of both of the two male waiters. I have worked in the food industry for over 10 years, so I understand what it is like to work as a waiter and deal with customers, and so I make sure I treat the waiters nicely and respectfully. Anyway, I had to ask the waiter again if he could bring over another bowl of Balsamic Vinaigrette, and he said, ""oh yes, sorry about that."" I said, ""not a problem."" the waiter then walked back behind the bar, where both our two waiters were working, and I noticed that when the waiter was grabbing more Balsamic Vinaigrette, he looked at our other waiter and started to laugh and shake his head, like he was frustrated that I was asking. I did not appreciate that at all. I did not feel welcomed and I felt like I was an inconvenience to the them, even tho I was the customer. If my dad had not treated me and my girlfriend to my birthday dinner, I would not have tip the waiters because of the disrespectful act that both waiters did... So much disrespect from these two waiters, I really hope the manager sees this post and deals with it appropriately so that it NEVER happens again.

Anyway, our food came and it was correct. I ordered the wood fire rotisserie pork sirloin which was by far the most AMAZING pork sirloin I have EVER had!!!! Well done!!!! And my girlfriend had the spinach and cheese filled ravioli which she said was also amazing!!! And for desert, we were surprised with a really good tiramisu, with a candle in it, that also came with some kind of chocolate ice cream which was really good, at no charge!

Overall, the food was EXTREMELY good and I highly recommend people come and dine here. However, I also highly recommend that people stay away from the bar area when the two Hispanic men are working behind the bar or are just in general working, because you will definitely have issues if they are your waiters.",2019-09-11 02:34:24
1gUcw1FBeEOSiQDidggp1g,0RX9w878R80Ok5iPrNBv3g,DcWGWEN_F1Ee0cFq6CxiEw,5.0,3,1,1,"My good buddy with the same name, Jerry, told me I needed to try this Asian restaurant. People don't usually text me out of the blue to say ""eat at this place"" so when I got the recommendation, I had to immediately act on it.

This particular restaurant is named Ginger, and it's nuzzled right off Main Street Medford, on the other side of route 70 where the name actually changes names. Needless to say, though, it's easily accessible and ripe for the picking.

When you walk in, you're immediately teleported to China, or Vietnam. The title of this post is ancient Asian secret, and you feel like you're about to be told the secret as you walk in. The owner's wife was incredibly nice, and accommodating. I was there to pick up a take out order (#daddylife), so I expected someone to just throw me a bag of food in styrofoam containers and be like ""thanks come again"". This couldn't be further from what actually happened.

She sparked up a conversation with me, asking where I'm from, where I live, what my life situation was. In our conversation she found out this was my first time visiting Ginger. When she heard that, she went into hospitality mode. She brought me my food, pulled out each container, then explained each item. Told me how best to eat it, told me how it differs in Asia, and explained what items should be my next choices if I were to return. I mean, this lady really took time outta her day and made the effort to make me a returning customer. Without even tasting the food, she accomplished her goal. I decided right then that I'd be back.
Now to the food.

As a starter, I went with the restaurant favorite. The Coconut Shrimp with Honey Wasabi sauce. Incredible. The shrimp is lightly breaded, and the little coconut threads nicely compliment the big shrimp you're chomping into. Something about that taste of light sweetness, mixed with the saltiness of a shrimp. Sooooo fucking good. Now you're sitting at about an 8 on the delicious scale.  Then you take that shrimp and you dunk it into honey wasabi sauce. I never heard of honey wasabi, and I regret that. But this is a mistake that i plan on rectifying yesterday. Dipping your coconut shrimp into this heaven sauce takes your 8 and catapults it right off the scale. Coconut Shrimp with Honey Wasabi sauce will be ordered every single time I come to Ginger.

Next, I had to go with one of my favorite Asian meat dishes. THE DUCK!  I don't know what makes Peking Duck different than any other kind of duck, but that's what I went with. I ordered the half order of the Peking Duck. This order prompted instructions from the owner's wife. It comes with ""a pancake"" that you can wrap the duck in, add some greenery, and you have yourself little duck fajitas. She explained to me that Asian people like to use rolls, and make little duck sandwiches. But ""white people like to eat duck with the pancake"". Well, I guess I was white for the night because I went with the pancake and it was a great choice.  I created little duck fajitas and topped it off with this lovely thick dark sauce that added a little sweetness to the duck. The meat was so tender and the skin of the duck was so crispy. Mix that with the softness of the pancake you're wrapping it all in and you got yourself a masterfully elegant meal. With the portion they give you with a half duck, you get about six wraps full of meat. Perfect portion for one fat ass like myself. When you add the shrimp, you're nicely filled up by the end of the meal. Actually I needed to save some for later. It heated up easily and was just as delicious the next night.

In conclusion, big shout out to Jerry Marenga for recommending this place. Also a shout out goes to my lovely fiancé Casey, because she recommended it months ago and I never acted on it. So if I didn't mention her in all this, I'd be eligible for an ass kicking.  Anyway, I must pass on the recommendation to everyone else. This place is legit.  If the two items I ordered are any inclination of how good this establishment is, then I think we found ourselves one of the best Asian cuisine restaurants in the area.

Ps - just to make the pot a bit sweeter, literally and figuratively, the owner's wife threw in this delicious coconut ice cream type of dessert. It was like eating coconut water ice/ice cream out of a real coconut.  If you weren't feeling fat while you were eating dinner, this finishes up the experience.",2017-12-09 17:21:55
Pnz61Y6OzOr8jpx0X0gvdg,C-kxQl9axw_hWpgQk5DsSw,l40N7SRPosI2PotbnIy8nw,3.0,5,0,0,"I hired these guys to replace my roof with metal. The guy came out and spent about 3 hours on a whole song and dance about metal roofing. It was fine, somewhat informative, and definitely slanted towards getting me to pay for a metal roof, which of course I knew it would be, so totally fine. 

He then quoted me a price that he immediately said they couldn't come down from. After a back and forth he dropped the price almost a quarter. Hard negotiating tactics and games I didn't appreciate. He also claimed that there was some urgency about signing the contract due to a likely price increase in materials that subsequent contractors told me was a lie. At this point I feel that it is likely that I could've gotten an even lower price by not signing a contract on the first day, HOWEVER I did have a couple of other contractors out both of whom quoted significantly higher prices. 

Additionally he tried to sell me on some features including a lifetime transferrable workmanship guarantee transferrable to the next owner. I have no record of this anywhere and despite asking for it I wouldn't have any way of proving this or getting any value from it when I sold the house. He also claimed that if anyone in the neighborhood (within 2 miles I think) got a metal roof they would immediately send me a $500 wawa gift card (They apparently do Wawa's roofs, or so he said). I had a neighbor approach me and ask about my roof. She lives literally a block over, got her roof done and listed me as a referrer. I got nothing until I hounded them by phone and email for weeks on end. I still haven't gotten anything except an email saying they've sent me a gift card for $100 and that they have no idea about $500. Whatever, seemed like a weird/unrealistic promo anyways but I don't like being lied to. 

Lastly when I talked to the initial salesman I asked him about any potential hiccups that might increase the price. I told him I was paying the edge of my budget and I just wanted to be prepared for any possible price fluctuations due to foreseeable problems. He told me it was highly unlikely that the price would deviate from the agreement.

Our project manager set a date during which I was on vacation, which was fine, but did not communicate when they cancelled due to weather. I literally thought the work would be done and came back to the same old roof. There were several more scheduling hassles and poor overall communication about the work. 

Finally when the work was done, the guy told me a lot of the wood had been rotted and they needed to charge me another $1,500 for extra sheets of wood they'd had to use. Its not a lot compared to the total price of the roof, and I was able to negotiate down to $500 (very quickly, I might add) but it left a bad taste in my mouth. Also we had agreed on a gutter around the roof and what they put in was a yankee gutter (google it). Not the same thing at all, but does approximately the same job, except when you have small sheets of ice on the very edge of your roof which fall to the ground one by one because there isn't a gutter. Again, not a huge deal, happened once, but potentially dangerous.

Overall the quality of the work seems to be good, their workers were friendly and they did it quickly and left the job site clean. Thats what matters most which I why I gave 3 stars. That being said, know going in that they are HIGHBALLING you by at least 25% on the first estimate and forcing you to play games about price. Also ANY promises they make need to be in writing.",2017-05-17 13:17:34

i ordered something from the 'lunch all day' menu (because i wanted a smaller portion than i would have received from the dinner menu), and i generally like some soup & salad with my dinner, so i ordered their Caesar salad & a cup of their Cajun chicken-&-corn chowder - both of which are always quite good.

The menu very clearly stated for the soup 'add $2.50'.  It very clearly stated for the salad ""add $3.50'.  Not a problem.

There WAS, however a problem when i got my check.  I had been charged $6.50 for the salad.  Let's face it - $3.00 isn't a big deal these days, but something about it bothered me.  I suspect many people would have just sighed & paid it.

i asked my server about it, and she told me that 'only one add-on item was permitted' at the prices listed.  it did not say this anywhere on the menu.  I asked her to send over the manager, who gave me the old 'i'm only following orders...' line.  She did suggest that i call the next day, which struck me as a bit patronizing.  Seems to me that if she's truly a manager, she should be truly MANAGING and have the authority to make an adjustment over a relatively minor dispute.  How is a customer supposed to know about the pricing differential if it's not printed on the menu?  The owner(s) make a monkey out of her if they don't give her this managerial responsibility.  This almost felt like a very slick, subtle bait-&-switch.

(Also, i wrote about this place once previously and gave it all sorts of compliments, except for some well-flavored lamb being rather tough & hard to cut.  The manager at that time had no problem offering me 1/2 off the price, so what gives here?  I'm NOT the type of person who 'drinks all the milk & then says it's sour', but something is definitely amiss here.  Leg of lamb, by the way, seems to have vanished from the menu.)

They do so many things RIGHT here that it's sad to see something simple like this so mis-handled.  I'll probably still eat here b/c it's good food, a clean place, & great servers like Rachel, Kat, and even the young lady who served me this time.  However, i'll eat here much less frequently than i've been, and with alot more attention paid to menu prices vs. what i'm actually charged.

The staff are some of the rudest people I have dealt with on the planet. I had to buzz in more than 3 times for the front desk lady to finally let me in. I stood in front of her for 10 minutes and she finally asked, ""what do you want?"" She acted as if I were inconveniencing her as she was on her phone. 

I was actually about to leave. 

Then, the woman I scheduled to meet with didn't come out to the lobby on time as she said in the email. I let the front desk lady know that I was there to meet Natalie, and she told me to call her on her cell phone. What? Can't she give her a quick call? Why was she late anyways? 

Whatever. They all acted as if they didn't need a tenant for the all the empty spaces. 

The building itself is actually .5 stars better than the staff! The elevator was shaking so much, I thought I was going to die :-) It was great. The hallway smells like weed and cigarettes. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a few years so that's great too! The ""studios"" are the smallest things I've seen. NOT WORTH THE PRICE. The studio is 3/4 of a normal bedroom and a portion of that is occupied by the ""kitchen"" area. 

It was really weird. When she went to show me a studio, I guess they don't have a policy on letting the current tenants know that people are visiting? She was just about to key in when a man answered the door with a sick wife. The rep tried to show me and the poor guy had to tell us that he was uncomfortable with that. 

I was actually scared to be there because A) the elevators were about to break 2) the halls are STRAIGHT out of those horror films.

I asked if there are any background checks because, duh? NONE. Just make the deposits with recent pay stubs. That's a joke. I'm pretty sure that there offenders' services a couple of doors down too, so safe? Not so much. Worth it? Not at all.

Believe all the reviews. This place is just awful. The apartments are unique for sure, the pool is very pretty. But if you look just past the surface, the apartments are littered with roaches (even by Nola rules), there are literally dozens of feral cats living under the property leaving a very nasty stench and don't get me started on the ridiculous amount of DOG POOP everywhere - around the property, in the main areas - disgusting. They allow smoking anywhere on the property so there are cig butts on the sidewalks inside the main courtyard. It stinks constantly.  Then you go inside - the drawers don't close, the appliances are old and barely working, there is MOLD everywhere. 

They shut the water off every week and when it comes back on, the water comes out GREY and murky. You literally bathe in grey water. You would think for as much money as you pay for rent, asking for basic services like clean vents and clear water wouldn't be a big deal. But it is, due to the Queens of catty that never seem to get fired - Ashley in sales and more specifically Holly. She's either incredibly stupid or malicious, hard to tell.  

In my time there, they have had 4 managers and 3 different sales people. So the one consistent person has been Holly and she is the worst.  Ashley trained underneath her, so she has picked up all her bad habit. Need anything done, don't go see her. She lost so many service requests and then smirks at you when you go to the office to see why. Always has some passive aggressive response and it makes you want to scream. When I switched apartments, they changed the locks, MID MOVE and when I went to to the office to ask WTF, they made me sit outside for 30 minutes while they pretending to find a key. I was livid. 

When I was finally let back inside THEY HAD STOLEN ALL OF MY KNIVES AND COOKING EQUIPMENT. And these weren't some 99 cent store items, these were cast iron pans, stainless steel knives, gold plated cutlery - I went down to the office and was screaming at them that if they didn't get my stuff back to me in 30 minutes, I was calling the cops. They pushed me too far and I don't think they expected me to get all agro, but seriously?!? In less than 30 minutes some poor maintenance guy was sent to return all my things with an apology. They are awful humans. 

The only good thing about the place is the maintenance crew. But they are overworked and are always on the move. After a while, you learn to skip the main office and just ask one of them to help you when your AC, dishwasher or wash machine breaks down, because they always will. 

I highly warn anyone - DO NOT MOVE HERE. It's not worth the money. The apartments may be unique, but they haven't been kept up and it's all falling apart. Bathrooms are smaller than most gas station bathrooms and about as old and worn out.  Expect nothing to be clean when you  move in. Do't expect fresh paint. The cabinets are 70's style particle board. all the appliances are white and cracked.  

A new place was built next door and is new and clean and amazing. SO I MOVED THERE. Love the neighborhood, the parks, the bayou, but avoid this place. You'll get bent over. and Holly will be sitting there with her meth mouth smirking because for some reason, they think having an incompetent jerk as the first face anyone sees when they come to American Can is a good thing. 

Your packages get stolen ALL THE TIME because none of the security measures are in place - Lockers don't work so packages are left in the garage, no cameras, all the door locks are busted and the gates don't close.

It's known as the public pool of mid-city because people come in (due to NO LOCKS on gates) and just crash the BBQ/Pool area that don't live there and when you complain to the office, they kind of shrug shoulders like it's no big deal.

My car was broken into 3 times - and I'm in the covered lot!!! I could go on and on, but I finally had enough and just left. They are threatening to sue me now - adding to the LONG list of lawsuits this place has going on. Pathetic. I wish I never moved into this cesspool. So suck it American Can.

Moving to the city and trying to find a haircut I can afford on a less-than-graduate-student-income budget, has been a challenge.  Supercuts is $12.95 for a cut.  

I'm a pretty simple woman.  I never thought I'd be too high maintenance for this place...

I just wanted a trim.  I haven't cut my hair in 2 years and wanted to get the dead ends out.  The place was pretty full (of all men) but I had the time, so I added my name in the computer and waited.  There were 2 women stylists and one man stylist.  I texted the boyfriend that it would be hilarious if I got the guy, seeing as how I was the only woman client.  Welp, got the guy.  He did not sweep up his station before calling my name, so I stood there kind of awkwardly (thinking that sitting would get me in his way) until he asked me to sit... in the previous guys buzzed clippings.  

I'm learning that if you want a shampooing, its gonna cost you extra in the world of haircuts, but I have A LOT of hair and it is THICK.  I don't understand the desire to sit there with a squirt bottle and spray for 5-10 minutes instead of just taking me over to the sink and wetting it down real quick.  I suggested it to the guy, and he said ""shampooing is an additional $8.""  I tried to explain that I didn't want it shampooed, just perhaps wetted a little faster and with less spray getting all over my shirt, but alas.  He asked what I wanted - I told him just a trim, cut out the dead ends.  The trim itself took no time.  I ran home right after to shower off the hair bits (because I sure didn't get a brushing after that) and when my hair was dry - still a ton of split ends.  I saw him cut my hair, the boyfriend said it didn't look like anything bad had happened to my hair, so I don't understand how I still had so much damage...

You get what you pay for I guess, but if this is the only haircut I can afford, I'm just gonna have to start wearing more buns and tucking in the ends.",2014-02-06 18:13:14

I really appreciate them taking the time listen and write me a response. Also, I visited a second time this past week. Service was much improved (although the server made it a point to show how annoyed she was that our group of twenty all wanted to order shakes. Apparently it was a major inconvenience to the back of house. But, hey who wants to make that awful stuff called money!). One star to three stars. Boom. 

Original review:

Today's lunch was my own personal hell. I will never, ever eat here again unless I have two hours to kill on a hamburger....

which is never.

First, let me preface this story with the fact that I rarely eat burgers. Last one I had was over a year ago. They're just not my thing. So if I go 'burger', it's gonna be gourmet. So why not have a chef Michael Symon gut bomb on a bun for my yearly treat?

Co-workers had recommended B Spot, so a group of us went for lunch (this was today, a Tuesday). We arrive at 11:40a.m. to a mostly dead restaurant. Two other tables full, tops. There are six of us. Seated right away, but at least ten minutes pass before a server address us.

And by address us... I mean that is literally all he did. It was 'I know you've been waiting.... ' then he's gone again. More minutes pass. He comes back and asks 'Do you know who Michael Symon is?'. Me annoyed and knowing who he is blurts out a quick 'Yes'. Thinking he'll move right along he's seems surprised by my knowledge. Please, don't insult my intelligence before I even order. Even more annoyed.

We order. Food arrives in decent time.

My burger is a little more well done than I would have liked, but it was really yummy. I had the Lola. Best part were the pickled onions. The egg was cooked perfectly as well and I will never say no to bacon on anything.

We ask for our checks at 12:30p.m.

Checks return and it was like watching the Mexican hat dance. So much swirling and here and there and 'no, this was your ticket', 'oh your seat number one'. OMG... just let us figure it out!!! By the way, all of us already had our payment method out and ready for him to process. Instead he waltzes away!

He returns and he is armed with the phones that process your payment table side. He picks up the first check holder, opens it and sees cash. He asks me, 'Do you need change?'. I reply 'No. I paid with credit card.'. He folds the holder then opens it again. Looks at the ticket then says 'Oh, right. You did not order this burger.'.... AS IF HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WASN'T MY CHECK!!!! 
Triple annoyed.

He zips a card through the hand held device. Then walks away. For a very, very long time. He then starts to repeat this weird process of hovering over the pile of checks on our table, then he's away again. To sum up this long story, he explains he processed some of our cards on another table's orders, etc. Voids. More voids. Then he's back. STILL DOESN'T HAVE ALL OF OUR CHECKS PROCESSED! We did not leave until almost 1:15p.m. We asked for our checks at 12:30p.m.

And the worst part? Because we were a table of 6 or more (just 6 of us, only one person too many!) we paid a 20% automatically added gratuity. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!

I would really like to think our server was just having a really bad day, but please get someone to help you if you are struggling. I get really nervous and uncomfortable when I see people fail. It was 45 minutes of watching a train wreck over and over and over again. 

I see there are several other reviews complaining about the service. Then there are others that rave about the place. Very inconsistent. Sad thing is we were planning a work group dinner here next week. Pretty sure that's cancelled now!",2015-10-07 02:35:15
w7WTOBESLJYBZcQnoBKlrg,71VGvKDnYzhQZj_7pjWPTQ,B4vCJ2B63KkEJSEFL-9Lcw,1.0,2,1,0,"I was at this establishment with a group of friends about a month ago.  I waited to write a review to allow myself to gain some perspective.  Still angry.  Still will never return.  But at least I can be objective.

Because we had a large group (there were 12 of us) and we were going on a Saturday and La Tia's doesn't accept reservations, we had an early dinner at 4:00. I called a little after 3 to get on a wait list.  I explained we don't all have to sit together (but it would be nice if possible).  Of course they explained that couldn't guarantee we would be able to sit down at 4, but they would do their best.

At 4:00, they said they didn't have a table available yet. This is fairly standard at restaurants that use a wait list vs a reservation, so I wasn't put out at all.  A few minutes later they had a table for 6.  Part of our group sat down.  Another 10 or 15 minutes later, they had another table for 6 next to the first one and the rest of us sat down.  It was great they were able to get 2 tables so close together.

The chips and salsa were AWESOME!  Our waiter frequently checked back and kept our drinks refilled and quickly took our orders.

Check out my photos to see one of their signs.  Very funny.

The first major incident happened when our meals arrived.  My meal was fine.  Nothing special, but it was ok.  However, a friend at my table was unhappy because his meal was cold.  He said it wasn't that it wasn't hot enough or that it was room temperature, he said it was literally COLD.  As in out of the refrigerator cold. He complained to our server.  

I don't know who he spoke to, it might have been an owner (I overheard the exchange, but this was the first time I'd seen the person he spoke with.)  She informed him it was because of the toppings.  First of all, you don't argue with your customers.  It doesn't matter why it was cold - it was cold.  Secondly, if it was just the toppings that made it cold, the inside of the dish should have been hot but it was not.

After my friend pushed the issue, she finally asked, ""Do you want me to warm it?""  Well of course he did!  He complained of a cold dish.  He paid you for a hot meal, which he didn't get.  And you have to ask if you should fix it???

I wasn't happy and my friend wasn't happy, but these things happen.  The rest of our meal went without issue.  Until about 5:45.  Remember, our table wasn't seated until close to 4:30.  A server approached our table and said, ""Just to let you know, we have another party coming at 6.""  We were still eating!  Several people at the table had ordered dessert and their desserts were only partially eaten.

We followed your procedures and calmly waited almost 30 minutes beyond our requested time before we were seated.  Yet we're expected to make way for someone else?

BULL!!!  I'll be sure to make way for someone else by never returning to your restaurant.",2020-01-20 02:28:38

It's not so much for the food, but the clientele.  If you can go on an off day(not night, never go at night) and when the kids are still in school, it can be an enjoyable experience.  Otherwise, you will get what you get, this is a place built for parents to unload their kids at while they sit somewhere in peace and ignore them.

I repeat, this is a place built for parents to unload their kids at while they sit somewhere in ""peace"" and ignore them.  If you are going into any CiCi's expecting something different, that's on you bud, but that is why I gave this a 3-star.  It's basically a cheaper Chuck E. Cheese, or Showbiz pizza if you're as old as I am.

With that said, they re-did the interior of this CiCis location I want to say within the last year.  It does look alot better than it used too, less divey, and much more efficient.  You also are requested(but not obligated)to dispose of your plates now too, which I know is upsetting to the parents because I witnessed one kid point out the sign on ALL the tables as they were being led away, the parent read it and said ""I AIN'T DOING ALL THAT AT A CICIS!!"" and they left three tables loaded up with dishes and half eaten pizza.  But that is their customer base, and exactly who they are marketed too.

The base price is:

Adults: $6.29(not including drink)
Kids: $3.59

The do offer personal pizzas as well as wings and such you can order when paying but be forewarned, they will take forever making this for you and in my case forget you ordered it altogether.  Then after you've given up and asked for a refund, they go ""oh yeah, you did order that."" shrug and give me my request.  If you are just a stay at home something with no place to be that can be fine, but for me, I had to get back to work.

As far as the food on the buffet goes, it's good, flavorful and plentiful.  If you can stand the atmosphere of the other customers you're good.  Non-gourmet pizza isn't difficult to do and CiCis has it down.  The crusts are pressed by a machine fast, which means they can put the toppings on load it in the cooking roller and that's it.  They have never run out of pizza while I was there and it's always getting refreshed.  I try to go for the ones that have just been put out, with less touching from the customer side makes me feel a little better about eating off a buffet.

I know this was long and I apologize for that, enjoy the pics...",2019-04-24 22:32:37

Property: if you have a day to spend here, I would absolutely use the opportunity to just enjoy it all! They offer a variety of outdoor seating and exploring. While walking out of dinner there was a couple with a bottle of wine relaxing in a small gazebo. I'm sure they are very accommodating to whatever you would like to enjoy during your visit. Be sure to check out the garden during your visit. It has a great view of the building and some of the herbs are grown in that garden! (Farm to table, eh?!) Side-note for females, if you plan on wearing heels or wedges be careful in the parking! It is gravel and very tricky to walk on at night! I practically fell walking down the hill after dinner. Be cautious! Apple added a flashlight to the front of your phone for a reason ;) 

Food: 

Organic Beginnings from the menu -- cheese cheese cheese. I'm mentioning this because you MUST order the cheese board. I love Gouda cheese, it's a treat each time I am able to enjoy it! The Gouda cheese on this plate with the fig chutney and baguette was delicious. It was the perfect way to start after touring the grounds. The Camembert Crock is another story, it was a unique dish! I've never had anything like it. The cheese was baked with pistachio and strawberry-rhubarb jam, you then dip your the bread into the creamy cheese! Last starter, bowl of cottage. Don't think too much about this one, it's literally a delicious bowl of cottage cheese with topping and house made sourdough bread. Simple and a must order! 

Diner -- I went with the Farmhouse Smashed Burger! Oh my, oh my! I think I'm still full from that meal. The chef recommended the cooking of the burger and it turned out perfectly. It is a burger made of 100% grassfeed beef and ground bacon topped with mouthwatering ingredients, but my favorite was the horseradish pickled cabbage. I'm telling you now, ADD AN OVER EASY EGG! Comment and let me know how that works for you! 

Dessert -- I'm a fan of smaller desserts. We split one piece of pie and added one scoop of vanilla ice cream. Can I get an amen for the perfect dessert?! The pie changes daily, because fresh pie of course. Our pie was a blueberry rhubarb and the crust on that thing was something to rave about. I'm wondering how long it took them to perfect it in such a way it was sweet and crunchy, but also didn't take from the filling!! Genius. 

Wine -- Of course I ordered wine! Order wine with the cheese plate and enjoy that glass slowly. Order another for dinner! I had a recommendation from the waitress, based of my dinner selection! It was a Pinot noir and paired well. 

My overall advice is to enjoy the restaurant! Take your time at the table and enjoy the company of who you have come to eat with. If you're like me, you've left downtown for dinner and that doesn't happen often! 

Next time -- I'm ordering the over easy egg on my burger and I'm making my date get scallops. This is a plan I'm making, so then I can have the best of both worlds! I'll also do the toffee dessert next time.",2017-06-14 03:29:03
wMt7chZY79lBFILoug-6bQ,Pj4bP_ZF1EPOltvwJJT-kg,NcIL7U3U2mML-kGxRloMLA,2.0,9,0,1,"I'll start out by saying I now like to think of Value Vet as the Minute Clinic of pet care. You might want to go here for basic services like puppy visits & shots but don't take your pet here if they have a real problem.

We wasted literally HUNDREDS of dollars going to this place (well over $1000 in total.) We have a dog with allergies. It got really bad and lead to chronic ear, eye, and skin infections. Each time we went to Value Vet they asked the same questions (yes, he eats out of a metal bowl, we only buy good dog food, etc, etc.) which you'd figure would be on his file... And each time, we got a variety of antibiotics, special shampoos, and steroids. Our dog spent over a year in cone b/c we just couldn't find anything to calm the allergies. He'd pick at himself which lead to the ear/eye/skin infections and we'd be back at the vet. 

At one point, we asked he be put on a steroid regimen b/c that was the only thing that kind of helped. They did a lot of blood work ($$$) then said okay. By the next time we returned for more steroids, they said he'd have to be tested again b/c it had been over 6 months. I thought they said the tests were good for 1 year. 

After suffering through this for ages, I ran into a woman at a dog park who said her dog was put on Apoquel for similar allergies and it had worked miracles. When I asked Value Vet, they said it wasn't good for dogs and we should see a doggy dermatologist. They referred us but no one ever called us back *thankfully.*

FINALLY, a friend's dog came down with something similar and she told us her vet was able to fix him. So we took our dog to Hermitage Animal Clinic. They checked him out, we told them our story of all of the runaround we'd be doing, they prescribe Apoquel and he is a changed dog. His quality of life is so much better now. No more cone, rarely licks or scratches, no more infections. Our poor guy suffered for so long and we just trusted Value Vet's opinion that there wasn't anything more to be done. Shame on us for not taking him somewhere else sooner. We would have saved our dog lots of misery and ourselves lots of money.",2015-03-28 21:09:59

Before I go into the review, let me just say how extravagant this place is. What they've done is absolutely gorgeous. The decor is uniquely breathtaking and like nothing I've seen before. Felt so fancy and upscale. 

I noticed that they have an outdoor patio behind the restaurant near the parking. I presume it's used only when the weather is warm. Looks like it has a lot of space for entertaining. I can see myself enjoying a nice little brunch out there later this year. 

The restaurant was basically empty when we arrived. It's huge in there. Looks deceivingly small from the outside though. I can only image how many customers they can fit there on weekends and how busy it probably gets. We were seated at a table by the window, which was great. A woman who looked like the manager came over and swung the curtains open to bring some natural light in. Our waitress walked up and took our drink order shortly after. Didn't get her name but she was awesome and very attentive throughout the night. She brought us bread and butter with the drinks. 

We asked for the sweet fire pancakes from the appetizer menu and my friend got the mac and cheese. The sweet fire pancakes were on point! They were small sweet potato patties fried with red peppers inside and topped with sour cream. The sour cream offset the spiciness of the pancake. My friend let me try her mac... as a cheese lover, it could've been cheesier but it was still delicious. Tasted like baked mac and cheese. 

I ordered the wild mushroom crepes. The pictures I saw on Yelp of these crepes literally made my mouth water so I just had to get them. How did Lava come up with this concoction?! I wasn't sure what to expect after the first bite, but holy moly... they were excellent. A bit tangy with the mushroom sauce on top. They were easy to cut into and didn't create a mess. There was only cheese and mushrooms inside the crepe but it was still very filling. The mushrooms had to have been sautéed or something. They were spectacular, I'll be back for another round of the crepes. 

Service was great, ambiance was lovely. Reasonable prices for the quality and quantity of food. Highly recommend if you want to try some fun and fresh European cuisine!",2019-03-28 01:59:27

Fortunately, when I got my own apartment, I started making plans to bring a cat into my life and give them a ""fur-ever"" home.  After a few visits to the PAWS adoption center to play with some of their cats, I decided they'd be the ones from whom I would adopt my soon-to-be furry companion.  The adoption center always welcomes visitors with open arms, even if you are not planning to adopt; though the cats who play well with other cats live in rooms together and the ones who don't live in cages.  The center only keeps one or two dogs onsite, so the ratio of cats to dogs is definitely much higher on the cat end.  PAWS does not put pets on hold, though I filled out the adoption paperwork about a month before I came in to adopt my cat, and once I was notified that I had been approved and that my apartment's pet policy had been confirmed, I was all set, but the only thing missing was a cat.  Finally, on April 19, 2014, I set foot in the PAWS adoption center to find the perfect cat.  When I mentioned I was looking for a fairly young cat who would do well in a small apartment (mine is 400 sq. ft.) who was affectionate and likes to cuddle, the shelter staff suggested a cat named Chalk.  Her estimated age was 4-6 years old so that threw me off, but they assured me that was only an estimate and that the age was to be taken with a grain of salt because the amount of tartar buildup on the cat's teeth is what they use as their criterion.  After spending a bit of time with this kitty, I decided to take her home.  I signed the agreement, bought a carrier, and was sent off with a small bag of cat food with my kitty in tow.  I have since renamed her Beaker, but I am glad to report she is happily adjusting to her new home.  I would HIGHLY recommend PAWS to anyone who is looking to adopt a cat; the staff is so helpful, friendly, and will assist you in finding one who will make a wonderful addition to your home and your life.  

Thank you PAWS (from me AND Beaker!)",2014-05-12 18:55:29

This one star review is about the total inefficiency of their appointment system and horrible bed side manner exemplified by the staff that treated my mother today.

My 75 year old mother, who had been treated for a cancerous tumor in her eye, had an annual check up today where her appointment was for 8:00am. When we arrived early (before 8am), the waiting room was already packed. We waited over 4 hours in the waiting room just to finally have her name called to be seen by her doctor. Based on the insane wait time we had experienced the year prior, I knew to bring a book and my lap top to get some work done. 

After waiting over *FOUR HOURS* to be seen, we ended up being shuttled to a small exam room where we ended up waiting another *HOUR AND A HALF* for the doctors to see my mom. At no point did any staff, nurses, etc offer any information about why we were waiting so long, or give any information on when we *might* be seen. 
Finally, the doctor's staff walked in, scuttled around my mom without ANY introductions and just started hurriedly examining her eye and recording down information. No, ""hello, I'm Dr. X"", or even an acknowledgement of her first name. No explanation of my mom's progress - simply ""your eye looks good"". One of the students was given the opportunity to look at my mom's eye - he never asked her name. He went right in to inspect her eye, then proceeded to have a discussion with his superior about how his technique could be developed better, not realizing that my mother wasn't simply a specimen, but a real live woman sitting there anxiously waiting for him to wrap it up.

I know that doctors are notorious for having terrible people skills and bedside manners, and I'm not asking for a chat over coffee, but for Chrissakes, at least acknowledge the 75 year old human being sitting in front of you before you start invasively prodding their eyeball. That's basic human courtesy. 

I really hope that someone revamps their appointment system soon, because the inefficiency we've experienced has been truly astounding. 

TLDR: For any basic 8am appointment, expect to end up eating your first meal of the day at 3pm, which is when you'll actually be seen.",2018-02-14 02:35:10

So we just cruised the city sightseeing since our planned agenda was still a day away. As we went we tend to call out the things we spot, especially off the beaten path eateries. There are three things mandatory when visiting NOLA: crawfish, po' boys, and gumbo. Add your choice of shellfish and you did it all. Brenda and I are both diabetic but we have distinctly different dietary needs and schedules. She needs a lot of protein and multiple meals or snacks while I get by on a late breakfast and dinner. She started getting hungry and we decided to take care of the mandatory po' boy. There is no shortage of places in NOLA to get one so we knew we wouldn't have to look far. We hit a side street and spotted a hole in the wall building that looked like it still carried the scars of Katrina. The sign proclaimed Gene's Po-Boy so we parked around the corner in a pretty shabby neighborhood, we inside to find a counter to place your order, 2 tables and 2 chairs. In the back room were active games of chance. Signs warned patrons and employees that no one under 21 better be seen anywhere near the door to the back. Another sign warned employees off the clock and former employees to stay the hell out if the kitchen or behind the counter. I decided I really didn't want to know why. The place was dingy but seemed clean. We decided on a catfish po-boy for Brenda. I wasn't ready to eat so i didn't order. When the sandwich came out, it was enormous. At least a two pounder. We took it back to the hotel and after a while I got hungry too. The massive torpedo was easily big enough for the two of us to share and it was indescribably delicious. There were four large pieces of perfectly fried Louisiana catfish adorned simply with lettuce and tomato. We both purred as we dined enjoying every morsel to the end. I've always known the best food can be found in the dives of the world and this one was no exception. I had to pull rank to get General Brenda to realize there was more gold in Louisiana than that one shop. i prevailed but it wasn't easy. Next trip, back to Genes.",2017-06-14 00:36:42

I LOVE Brazilian steakhouses so when I found out that it was restaurant week, I'm totally in. I'd been to Fogo in several cities and decided to give Chima a try because it's infinitely closer to my house. I should've taken the walk. 

Now as a guy I tend to only notice things like decor when they're bad, and the burnt orange theme of the restaurant definitely qualifies. In all fairness I DID come during restaurant week, so they were busier than usual, that being said...the whole point of restaurant week is having people try your place out so they'll come back and become normal customers.

Valet was meh, Check in went ok we were waiting an extra fifteen minutes from our reservation time but the place was packed and I try to be understanding of such things. We were seated and then we waited, and waited......and waited. The dining room was understaffed, I get it but we were starving. After another fifteen minutes I gave up and just asked one of the meat bearing gauchos to help us out, to his credit he did.

The gauchos did their jobs and are the only reason for the second star. After grabbing our buffet plates it was time to sit down and eat. All I wanted was a drink. What kind of drink you ask? What kind of overly complicated concoction did I have to wait another FOURTY-FIVE minutes for??? A soda!!!! That ever elusive beverage. After asking three successful servers for a soda ($4 by the way) I finally gave up and asked a Gaucho (the guys who walk around with meat and carving, aka the busiest guys in the place). Plus, aren't they supposed to be upselling me? All I wanted was a soda!!!! When it came time to get a second soda, I just saved time and effort and asked the Gaucho first. You'd think that with that mess they'd comp my soda but no.

Oh and before I forget, yet again I understand that its restaurant week, but would a little friendliness from the reception area be too much to ask? I'm happy that you got a foam latte from the bar, but since we're waiting in line extra time, how about a little polite conversation to your  lobby full of guests.

And though the shuttle they provided (at no additional charge) took people wherever we wanted to go, it was just too isolated from most everything except a couple restaurants within a half mile or so.  

Of course, being a typical hotel billing itself as high quality, combined with the isolation factor, the price of the food in the in-hotel restaurant was stupidly way higher than it should have been.  $18 breakfast buffets are just not very pleasing to me since I don't eat like a pig.  On my last morning there I got wise and just ordered from the menu, got the same mid-quality eggs, bacon, and potatoes I had gotten in the buffet, and saved $6, though even $12 is $4 or $5 more than it should cost.  

I ordered dinner the first night and asked for a well done burger.  Apparently the cook thought I had meant -cooked so long it's shoe-leather dry-.  

They have a ""business center"" with a few workstations (with extremely limited access to the web forced through a Doubletree branded browser that didn't allow me to do much of anything that wasn't pushing Doubletree / HIlton offers).  Fortunately I had my laptop with me.  The problem I had was when it came time to print out documents.  They have this stupid functionality where I had to upload my docs to some generic web printing service.  

That in turn got me some six digit code that was supposed to allow me to print - I assume on the one printer they had in the room.  But it never did work.  And since I was doing this on the morning I had to leave at a specific time, I ended up abandoning the printing attempts.  

Our event was held in the wedding tent they have near the pool.  Yes, it's a big wedding tent.  White, with white interior, with chandeliers for lighting (really?  Chandeliers?) Oh - and they had white christmas lights spiraling up the tent poles and along the wall/ceiling areas.  Fortunately those were left off for our business event.  

The tent has air conditioning (Extremely loud, by the way) - and when it was on, it pushed it's air up, over the pitched roof of the tent and down onto those of us sitting on the far side.  Which meant we were freezing when it was on, and the people sitting directly next to the air conditioning were actually sweating that whole time.  Sad. 

Overall it was a great stay because I was there for a business conference and so my experience was biased due to how much I enjoyed being with my peer industry friends.  And the staff really was helpful in the few things I needed them for.",2010-05-09 18:42:04

I have had Verizon home service for 23.5 yrs. I wanted to use the credit I had received from Verizon wireless to purchase a new camera for our home system. I had also just received an email offer of $15 off $40 accessories, so perfect timing. The problem is it wouldn't work when I tried to order online. I called Cust Serv, they were having trouble as well, so they made notes in system and said to go to the store and that the store would see that they were to honor it and order directly through them. This was from a Supervisor.
So I got to the store located at 715 W Dekalb Pike, King of Prussia, PA 19406. I started of speaking to a nice associate who said that he needed to get his manager to be able to handle the issue. No problem. I waited for the manager, Michael. Now is the problem. I explained it all to Michael and asked him to look up the account to see the notes put in by CS. He stated he did not need to and was going to because they ""could say to give me  free camera and that they were not going to. That the store did not have to honor anything that I was told by CS"". I again asked him to please read the notes on my account, again he refused saying he would see what he could do. Long story short, he said that the camera was more expensive in store, that he would honor the email discount (-$15) but not the credit (-$30) that I had, because he could not verify the terms??? I again asked him to look up my account to see what CS had put in, because they did verify the terms. He then stated that he wanted to but I had stopped him. I had now been trying to get this taken care of for almost 2 hours, 1hr and 10mins on the phone and now 30 mins in the store. I got upset and told the guy he was being difficult and rude. Another manager stated that I needed to calm down and that they were doing what they could. When Michael returned he crossed his arms and stood there staring me down like a cliche' nightclub bouncer. When I asked why he was just staring at me he said ""i'm not doing anything else for you"". I had asked several times how I could contact the distrist manager for the store and was told that they would not give me his info, they slipped and said his name Felipe. I asked for an email or text info and was told to figure it out myself. I lost it and told him he was being an ""a-hole"". I know it was wrong but after almost 2 hours to have someone treat you like crap, I'd had enough. We were arguing on the way out of the store, me and the 22 managers, when another associate, who was not involved with this, ran over and said to leave and that she was calling the Police. I said fine go ahead as I had done nothing wrong. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER. VERIZON REALLY NEEDS TO WORK ON THEIR PEOPLE SKILLS AND TREAT CUSTOMERS BETTER.

We had went to other places..(which I will do reviews on a little later), before we came here.. and we went to other places after here. The second day of trying to get the mattress purchase done we went to two other places and then ended up back here. The lady that helped us is very friendly, good customer service.. she was in the middle of placing orders for Serta and when she saw that we were leaning toward the Bellagio by Serta she told us that she was placing the order at that time but she would wait for us so that our order could be tucked in with it .. She said that if we got it in with that order that it could possibly be in next week but that it would probably take two weeks to get to the store and then it would need to be delivered to our house.We live out past Violet on Hwy 39 by E.B.I. Boats, so delivery is important, its about a 30 to 45 minute ride from this store to our home. The delivery charge is 90.00 and that's just to the front door.. which kinda took me back and seemed alittle off but okay.. i do live a ways away.. and my bedroom is on the second story.. and no my house is not raised.  
Overall I am happy with everything.. so far... customer service was great, very friendly, very nice people, the business is very clean and easy to get to. I am not happy having to wait two weeks plus to get our bed.. 
I will update this review as the situation goes. I couldn't find any reviews on this place before we came here so I decided to be the guinea pig... I dont think I am going to have any regrets though. 
I learned a lot through this purchase.. and there are some things I will do differently next month when I go to buy the two queen beds I need for the other bedrooms.. I have quiet a bit of furniture to be buying so this is the first experience.. well no this has been on going.. i do these major purchases a little at a time so I dont get overwhelmed.
 I have realized how important it is to review and read reviews.. sooo..

My family and friends love it, but I find it only on the downward side of so-so.  If you come here late in the evening you are bound to be disappointed, because it seems they are reluctant to put out fresh food.  The floors can sometimes be sticky but I understand that cleaning them during the peak time is difficult.  Many employees do not have a decent grasp of the English language and if you need something and ask for it, you may not get an immediate response, but you will probably have someone showing up at your table who knows more words than the last person.  We had a table of 10 or so people and we asked for a plate of tuna (sushi) to share at our table, we were told that they could not do that (yet they had done it in the past).  We asked again and the guy repeated himself and walked into the kitchen.  less than 5 minutes later the manager and the sushi chef approached our table with a large plate of tuna.  The manager, seeing how happy we all became, apologized with a smile and wished us a good meal. Oh, the parking here is MORE than plentiful, so no problems there. Overall the cost is fair for what you get and most local people will tell you that it is the best buffett around.  BIG DOWNSIDE: The Patrons, Many, not all, of the locals here do have the ""ME ABOVE EVERYONE ELSE mentality, so if you want crab legs, you have to be rude and take as many as you can (I am alergic to them, so it doesn't matter to me).  I was raised to always be respectful and NEVER take everything in sight when dining at a buffett, at home, or wherever.  If I failed to  ""always consider the next person"" while growing up (whether you know them or not) my father AND mother would have ascertained that I was knocked out  cold in a time when kids didn't talk back or call child services.  Sadly most here were not preached to from The Amy Vanderbilt Complete Book of Etiquette.  Another thing that drops the ambiance here is when adult patrons arrive here dressed in pajamas.
THE FOOD VARIETY: A decent buffet, with a lot to offer even the finickiest of customers.  I have noted that although I do see a LOT of children dining here, I have never heard that screaming/tantrum throwing child that we all fear sitting near.  This is because of the variety of food even reaches out to the kids with things like chicken nuggets and pizza... Oh and they have cookies (YAY! Macaroons!) and a nice Ice Cream station as well. The ice cream station, and please note I am not a HUGE ice cream fan, has a peppermint ice cream with peppermint candy pieces in it...  This makes it the best frozen dessert I have found at a buffet. well just because I am a fan of peppermint! :-)",2011-10-09 11:08:30
ETLZiDvUkMc_H6P7nenYdw,C1AebaLdwqjOpZRaHKWKAw,DWuZw05HAhZFpD4kCAvDew,5.0,2,0,1,"5 stars is really for Neil and the food. The ladies at the desk were the worst. They were snooty, rude and uninviting. They made it seem like they hated their jobs and all the people asking questions. They made it seem like they were annoyed that you would have the nerve to ask them if they had reservations open. Oh and by the way, we called to make reservations and they ladies who answered the phone were quick to say they were full and that they weren't accepting anymore walk ups because they were full with that too. Things changed when we walked down the stairs and requested to be put on the waiting list. They didn't turn us away. We received a text about 30 minutes later and we were seated. The ladies were still pretty rude when we checked in to be seated. Oh well, whatever. 

Neil is my favorite person ever. He was our waiter for our time in the restaurant. He was super friendly and inviting. We loved his compliments and how he chatted us up. We could tell he loved his job and the people he ""serves"". We received some freshly baked bread with butter to start us off. It was warm and yummy. We pretty much devoured it and had to request another loaf. We ordered the calamari for our appetizer. It was different than what I'm used to. There was no aioli sauce to dip into. It had the sweet chili sauce and bell peppers sauteed together and topped the calamari. It was delicious. For dinner, I ordered the Filet Oscar combo (it came with an appetizer, salad, and a side). My meal came with salad. I ordered the caesar salad. It was so good. I actually worked for the very last bit of salad on my plate so I wouldn't miss it. I really did just want to lick the plate but I stopped myself. Neil noticed I loved the salad and commented on how I worked hard for the very last bite. As far as my filet, according to the menu, Oscar style is a savory topping of jumbo lump crab, seared asparagus and house-made béarnaise sauce. Everything was delicious and melt-in-your mouth tender, mouth-watering, flavorful and heavenly. Every single bit of my filet had the sauce and the crab. I didn't want to stop eating. As for the garlic mashed potatoes, they were just ok. Not enough garlic for my taste but it was creamy. I only ate half of it. I should've ordered something else from the options since I usually have mashed potatoes with my steak. My sister ordered the lobster bisque. Mind you, by this time, we had no bread left so the soup was just the soup itself. It was just ok. My sister didn't like it and left most of it. It tasted better with bread accompanied with it. (The 2nd loaf finally arrived.). It had a distinct taste of alcohol and maybe that's why my sister didn't like it. I didn't mind it with the bread. Without the bread, it was pretty strong. My other sister ordered the seared ahi tuna. It was amazing. It was luscious. It was succulent. All the flavors went hand in hand. I couldn't believe my taste buds. It was mind-blowing and I loved it. The sauce, english cucumber, mustard-beer sauce, was amazing. I seriously just wanted to suck on the tuna just to savor the taste just a bit longer. If you weren't really hungry, like my sister, this is a great little meal.

We ordered some cocktails but the bartender was a little on the slow side. We didn't end up getting our cocktails until almost the end of our meal. It was fine but we thought they had forgotten about us. They didn't. It was just that the bartender (weird that there was only one) was so behind.

Anyway, the whole experience was amazing and I owe it all to Neil. He made it awesome, especially since this was the first time I had ever been to the restaurant. From first look at the menu, I wanted to order everything. Now that I've had my first taste of some of their offerings, I'm hooked and I wanted to try other items. My taste buds are doing the happy dance.",2020-10-19 06:07:18

DO NOT LIVE HERE! DO NOT CONSIDER IT! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BC THAT IS WHAT IT IS! A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! 

Lincoln property now owns Alden... does it surprise anyone else that they go through new management every 6 months? Anyways, they've been here about a month and a half now. They don't really understand what tenants deal with.

I haven't had heat for the past month in my bedroom. When I was finally able to speak to a competent person, they informed me thar all my service requests for my broken heater were marked as complete! I said how can that be since not one person has come to handle the situation? They said only maintenance can mark service requests as complete. I found out when i spoke to the maintenance people that they were getting Any requests so someone is lying, and there's zero communication between management and maintenance. ONE ENTIRE MONTH with NO HEAT and it's 35-45 degrees outside! 

To compensate me, MATT VANDENBERG (Assistant property manager) thinks that taking $6 off my rent a day is acceptable or appropriate. $6 a day for AT LEAST 25 days of no heat. That's only $150 off a $1200 a month rent. When the entire situation is THEIR FAULT! I've called and went down to the office numerous times about having no heat and not one person has done anything about it. As soon as i mentioned a lawyer, They deemed $6 off a day is acceptable. The heat and AC runs from the same unit and both runs electric. When your AC does not work in the summer and everyday that passes and it's not fixed and the temp is at least 75 degrees outside, $25 a day comes off your rent! THAT IS IN YOUR LEASE! NOT $6! They don't give a fuck about the tenants they just want to shut you up.

They sell you on the ""prettiness"" to live here. That's all Alden has to offer, is pretty grounds and two pools which are mobbed in the summer by people who don't even live here and annoying screaming kids and teens who want to have underage drinking parties making a ton of awful noise. That's all Alden Park has. And some tennis courts. 

Oh ya, they have broken toilets (mine is broken again!) broken heat (mine broke every year since I've been here), mold in many apartments including my friend who lives in Cambridge, they keep removing parking spaces ALL THE TIME, the elevator randomly stops working (one elevator in each wing that is SUPER TINY and old, the fire alarm goes off at least 4 times a month, the water is shut off from 9am-3pm at least 4-5 times a month to fix their pipes which clearly never get fixed. I guarantee you that there will be new property owners come August. I'd be surprised If the current owners stay past August. 

There's only good reviews on here because management tries to offer you a bogus incentive to put positive remarks up here. Maybe they offered $6 off a day from your rent. That makes more sense. Not $6 per day for no heat. That's them being cheap and stingy. 

They need to do better. Bad reviews spread a lot faster especially when you work in the news and media/entertainment division of Philly. 

No I'm not renewing my lease here. This place is awful. #DONOTRENTHERE",2018-01-07 01:55:02

We went right after we had our maternity pictures taken at Peace Valley Park and we were starving. Not only was the food amazing, but so was the service. My husband used to work at a restaurant when he was younger, so he analyzes and critiques the servers. He told me to join Yelp and to start describing our experiences. 

Jennifer was our server and came up to us promptly. She asked us if we have been here before and we told her that we were newbies and very hungry. She explained the entire menu to us and then suggested we get the Pesto Flatbread while we look everything over because they had tons of great food. We ate the flatbread as we decided what to order for the rest of our appetizers and meals. Jennifer helped us decide between a bunch of items and we loved everything. 

For other appetizers we got the Calamari & Hummus Trio. The calamari had a nice spiciness to it and there were three different kinds of hummus for us to try. They give you pita bread and vegetables with the hummus, which is nice. For dinner I got the Pork Chop and my husband got the Chicken. When my pork chop came out it wasnt cooked as well as I wanted it to be. Jennifer came over a minute after another employee gave us our food and I explained to her that since I was pregnant i needed my pork chop to be well done and put back on the oven. She was sympathetic, apologized and asked if I wanted a new dish all together. I didnt want to wait so I told her to just ask the chef to put it back on the oven for a few more minutes and I kept my sides. Five minutes later it was brought back out and Jennifer came up to make sure it was finally cooked to my liking. It ended up being perfect and delicious. Since I have been pregnant most servers seem apathetic when i ask for things to be put back on the oven because of my condition, but Jennifer seemed like she actually cared. 

When we were finished our entrees she came out with the dessert tray. She explained each one in detail and told us which ones were more popular. We ended up getting key lime pie and lemon. The check was semi expensive since we ordered so much food. Jennifer thanked us at the end and wished us the best of luck with our baby with a genuine smile. My husband gave her a great tip because he liked the way she respected me. We will be back to try more of the food since it is seasonally changing! :)",2014-06-04 17:54:30

Ok now for the negative...The tour guide who is also the owner of the museum showed up 30 minutes late for our tour, blaming it on traffic and difficult parking.  If you've ever been to New Orleans you know that traffic is a way of life in New Orleans and parking in the French Quarter is always and has always been difficult.   We drove in from Metairie, same as the tour guide and we arrived 30 minutes early for the tour.  He arrived 30 minutes late.  After a few mumbled comments in the museum, the first stop on the tour was at a corner grocery to get the tour guide something to drink because according to him, he will lose his voice if he does not have something to drink.  Again, as we arrived early, we had time to get bottled waters for our group.  This being the tour guide's normal job, and knowing he needs to have something drink, I have to ask why he had to take time out of our tour to buy himself something to drink instead of bringing it with him.  The tour took us through Louis Armstrong park, across Congo square on the way to the cemetery.  That was an interesting part.  The trip through the cemetery, took way longer than it needed to be.  On the way back from the cemetery he stopped at the side entrance to Louis Armstrong park to give us more history.  After several minutes it was apparent that he was waiting for some type of signal to bring us to his friend's restaurant and voodoo Indian museum across the street from the park.  He took us across the street to the ""museum"" not telling us that it was in fact a restaurant.  It was apparent that this was a prearranged stop to get us to buy lunch at this restaurant.  When we went inside he spent maybe 5 minutes with us and then went to speak at length with some diners that were looking to put together some type of tour guidebook.  This is the point where he essentially abandoned us.  After waiting several minutes, while he conducted his business, we decided that we had enough.  We left the restaurant and the cemetery tour.  All in all, I have to say, don't waste your time or money either with the Voodoo Museum or their so called cemetery tour.  It was all very unprofessional and grossly overpriced.  You'd get just as much knowledge by picking up a book on New Orleans Voodoo practices and history and conducting your own tour.",2012-07-26 00:57:55

I admit, I have spent far more money than I likely should have, but every time I stop by I never, ever, seem to regret the decision. It's really been something how they have slowly changed over the past nine or so months. They are constantly tweaking and experimenting, and there is often a special or two that is so good that it gets worked on the the menu.

I will repeat something I said in my last review: Peter Serpico is a shining example of a Modernist Chef. There are no dishes that will poke your eye out, no insane liquid nitrogen going off. The application of technology and complexity is subtler. The components on the plate aren't there to look pretty (though the presentations are beautiful), they are there because they should all be eaten at the same time because all of those flavors have been carefully selected to go together.

In approximately 8-10 visits I have yet to have a bad dish, though some are certainly better than others. The raw fluke, cobia and yellowfin tartare, duck liver mousse, dashi soup, fried duck leg and (the recently removed) hand torn pasta are all repeat favorites, and I tend to get one as a standby while I try something new. Portions are small, and you need to be willing to lay down some cash when you get here, but I enjoy being able to try many things and not walk away feeling bloated.

I love the atmosphere. It's proof that you can be high quality without being pretentious and stuffy, and the decorations are free of buillshit. The place looks clean and ordered without ornate wall art, or glittering china. Plates are simple but umblemished ceramic. Menus are written on the board in chalk, as are notes for the kitchen. The tables and chef's counter are dark wood, and while immaculately clean with sharp edges, it feels like a place where you can loosen a tie and put your elbows up on a counter and get about the serious task of enjoying, really enjoying food.

The staff recognizes regulars (at least I am when showing up every 6-8 weeks) and they are rewarded with insightful advice on specials, underappreciated menu items and . The bartenders respond well to the challenge of ""Make me something different"" and they have a small, but tasty, selection of excellent signature cocktails that run you about the cost a standard cocktail in center city. 

I'm happy with what I have seen, and I look forward to seeing more.",2014-04-19 13:35:01

People tend to have this stereotypical thought that hotel restaurants are overpriced establishments meant to overcharge visiting tourists. However, this is not the case for Maritana Grille. I would like to say that after tonight, Maritana Grille has secured a place on my list of top places to take people for good night out on the town in the Tampa Bay area. 

Located in the beautiful and elegant Don CeSar hotel, Maritana Grille is not a large restaurant. However, upon walking in, you feel a comfortable presence in the nicely lit dining room. The tables are covered in nice crisp linens and the seats are nicely plush. The room is accented by several fish tanks featuring tropical species that cues you in on the restaurant's focus on seafood. 

Today, we started off the meal with 2 appetizers, the foie gras and the sous vide octopus. Both were fantastic. The foie was accented with a hint of coffee flavor and was so smooth and rich that it kind of melts away and disappears in your mouth without being too overwhelmingly rich and heavy. The octopus was perfectly tender with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside for textual contrast and was paired with some fantastic sauces. 

For the main entree, I selected the loin of venison. Venison is one of those meats where it is so easy to get wrong by overcooking because of how lean the meat is. But not this place. It was cooked extremely well, fitting nicely right in between medium rare and medium doneness, staying nicely moist with just the right amount of chew. The meat was also seasoned well where you get a taste of the unique gaminess of the venison, but without it becoming too overpowering on the palate. 

Finally, the dessert. What a fantastic tiramisu. Most of the time, places just come out with your standard layered tiramisu. But tonight, the tiramisu was done in a more deconstructed manner, with nice streaks off cream laced with coffee dust and nice nuggets of gently soaked lady fingers amidst semi-sweet chocolate mousse.  

In short, too long didn't read, this place is fantastic. It is not your typical hotel restaurant. It is in fact quite the opposite and worth every penny that I paid tonight. Definitely looking forward to coming back here again :)",2018-03-23 03:45:34

They were very accommodating setting us up with a small private room for 10 upstairs on one of the busiest holiday weekends of the year.  

Entering (and leaving) the restaurant, you must walk through the cloud of cigarette smoke as the smokers all stand directly in front of the door.  Totally disgusting.  They should have a designated smoking area AWAY from the front door.  

I started at the bar - a total mob scene.  I wanted a Calvados Slider (the bartender had no clue what Calvados was so I settled for a nice Pinot Noir).  Seriously, stick with beer, wine or easy cocktails or one of the many (and outdated) martinis on their list.  

Our server was lovely, and kept the wine flowing through our 3 hour dinner.  We never, ever felt rushed.  We started with a few dozen Cape May Salt oysters.  - the lemony aioli sauce with the vinagrette was delicious.  They also had the standard cocktail sauce.  Salads were very nice.  I had the duck breast with chestnut stuffing.  The duck was well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  The stuffing was a little light on the chestnuts and could have used a little bit more flavor.  There were no green vegetables on the plate - a small portion of asparagus or something would have been nice as I usually only have a few bites of starches and prefer a portion of vegetables.  My mother had the Ricotta Gnudi - perfect little pillows (like gnocchi) of ricotta in a yummy sauce.  It was delicious and filling, but if you are not accustomed to richer, buttery, creamy food, you may be up all night! 

The night we were there, they offered free valet parking.  The valet were quick and efficient.  However, the valet who brought my car around later in the evening either had horrid BO or he farted in my car.  I had to put the windows down in 20 degree weather for the first 3 minutes of my drive home.  What a way to end a perfectly nice evening out for my mother!  

Would I go back to the Yardly Inn?  Of course, it is where my family likes to go.  Are there better, more innovative restaurants in Bucks County?  YES there are.",2010-12-20 17:40:50

The dentist I'd been seeing for about 10 years was no longer in my network and would have charged over $1000 out of pocket.  We called three dentists in network for quotes and went to this one because it quoted $400 out of pocket (after insurance), the lesser of the three.  When I went for x-rays 2 weeks before the tooth-removal procedure, I was prescribed sedatives because I have gag reflex; I was told to take 4 pills the night before and the rest (about 8) when I got to the dentist for the procedure.  I also paid the amount I was quoted right before the procedure and assumed I would owe no more.  The next thing I remember after getting in the chair was staggering into my bed several hours later.  I thought when my mind was clear that the drugs that knocked me out were excessive and I found out later from my mom, who drove me to and from the dentist, that indeed it was excessive.  More on this shortly.  When I went back two weeks later to have the crown put in, I was told to pay $64 for sedation that apparently was not covered by insurance. I questioned this because I assumed this was part of my quote, but the staff still insisted I pay.  I thought now, whatever.  The staff tried to small talk me during ths procedure, but I was not interested in conversation; just put the crown in and send me on my way.   Three weeks later, I get another unpleasant surprise; a bill that stated I owe $250 more.  There was was no explanation. I had to call back the next day and a lady said it was for additional sedation to put me to sleep.  I assumed this was covered either by insurance or the quote.  I was not told of this beforehand and I was very upset about that, with good reason. The lady said the quote was no guarantee of actual charges insurance would pay.  I was lied to and told the woman that on the phone.  The woman told me not to yell and scream  Lady, I will calm down when you tell me the truth.  I later found out from my mom they gave me additional drugs without consent from me (because I obviously was in no condition to consent and if I was I would not have consented) or from my mom (she said the staff did not ask her)..  I find this cowardly and unprofessional.  Also if there were complications - it's very possible - that is grounds for malpractice.   I had to pry from the lady on the telephone I was being charged for this excessive sedation as well as labor for doctor; isn't this what the dentist is being paid for?  I will pay this only because I do not want to deal with a collection agency and, though I have a good case, don't want to pay attorney fees that would be more than my bill.  So far, the amount I've had to pay out of pocket is what I would have with my previous dentist, who was up front and did not sneak any bills by after the fact.  Enjoy your money pal because you just lost a patient, permanently, with your deceptive and dishonest practices",2010-01-22 02:36:26
ldSm-MHIP0x9H9CbLuAWpg,nRf001mBEHTIrL1fAw54jw,ob9VgK6eAJkxUNv7GmETCw,2.0,11,4,2,"Like the first reviewer, I'm a resident of the area. I have been in 3 times, once to eat and twice to have a pint and watch a game. As far as the food and the service in the restaurant, it's hard to imagine it could have been worse. I had cheeseburger sliders which were cold and tasteless. My wife had the fish and chips. She liked the fish, but she nearly gagged on whatever the chips were supposed to be. They were gross. Not to mention it was supposed to come with cole slaw and it didn't. We would have mentioned this omission to our waitress, but she was nowhere to be found. We saw her twice: once for our drink order and once to drop off the bill. 

There was no hostess stand, so the silverware and the menus were on the fireplace hearth. That was weird. Now there is a hostess stand, but it is bizarre--it is a bright white Roman column looking thing that sticks out like a proverbial sore thumb.

My wife refuses to go back. I don't blame her. However, I don't mind the bar side. It's a lame crowd, mostly 11 Mile House regulars, thus a load of Q-tips. But I'm not there to pick up chics, so I don't care if the crowd is old. 

The bottom line is that we only half-jokingly call this Big Bear II. The decor is comical on the restaurant side. Typical ""hey, anybody have any sports memorabilia they can put on our walls?"" approach to decor. The booths, as mentioned above, must have come from Steak and Shake. It's cleaner than BBG, and the tvs are better, no doubt. Aside from that, the opening was obviously rushed, and ultimately this place will likely go the same route as the previous 752 bar and grills and occupied this same location. That makes me sad because the owners, from what I have heard, are great people. However, no matter how nice people are, when you open a business, you have to do it right the first time. What makes this place different than Kriegers? The place after Kriegers? It's obviously better than BBG, but I'd rather drink a beer at the Dollar Tree next door than BBG, so it wasn't tough to beat that. But, I ask again, how is this place different? Why will this survive here and not the others??

Months before BBG closed, we all talked about how a real Irish pub would do well in this location: live Irish music, dark interior with REAL wood, a menu with DIFFERENT food from the standard bar/grill choices. Alas, it's not to be.

I will say that they do know how to pour a Guinness, though. That's a good thing, but not enough to save the place. I for one will continue to drink a pint or two and watch a game periodically, but overall a real swing and a miss unfortunately.",2013-05-18 15:03:31
dK_jcJnE912Zgjn0feJRNg,VHvmnMAnKvqZIxH63BaF5w,hc0KmC42EzjXbC83eMIDMg,3.0,4,1,0,"Tried this restaurant awhile back with a friend as it was close to her class location and I've enjoyed trying things from the restaurant when at the Taste of Edmonton. 

Full disclosure - I'm  a meat eater but I do eat & cook vegetarian because I care for my friend's and try to make it less stressful picking places to eat. So I'm not new to this food selection. The waitress attending to us was knowledgeable about the menu. From our discussion with her, we selected some smaller dishes that would be good to share. I really enjoyed the cauliflower bites as they were the right consistency between crispy outside and cooked inside of the cauliflower. There was a sauce that added the extra amount of flavour to the dish. The veggie chicken in the king pao chicken was interesting. I knew immediately I wasn't eating chicken because of the texture but the flavours of the dish worked nicely together. Enough that I could ignore the texture to eat the dish. If you're a texture person too, then don't select the chicken satay as I think it would be even more noticeable. The ginger (soy) beef I wasn't wild about. Even with the tasty side of rice we ordered, it didn't really do much palate wise. I was also surprised to see it lacked quantity of veggies. Even though the waitresses were awesome and refilled our large water glasses (4 times as we felt dehydrated), the food and the large amount of water didn't give me the happy full feeling. It's a confusing feeling to have after eating a sizeable meal. I was intrigued by some other parts of their menu and if I was to find myself here again, I most likely would enjoy a massive bowl of soup.

As for the selection of 3 stars, I found that even though the restaurant is large, the layout is something that takes away from enjoying the food here. Seating people so close forces you to be part of other table's conversations. The wait staff can't properly reach the tables due to this layout during supper rush. We watched them struggle to serve as more people were seated. At one point the server had to come at a completely different direction (through the roped off ramp and pilar area) to even get to our table which meant she reached behind the table that was literally beside us. This situation made us feel uncomfortable. Also, I wouldn't advise bringing anyone here that struggles with hearing. It was too loud to have a proper discussion. These things made us feel like we should rush through our meal so we didn't have to be there anymore.

Lastly, I struggled to find parking. I don't carry a lot of cash on me and therefore have even less change. So if deciding to park at this lot, remember to bring your coins. There are a few spots along the street, but consider yourself lucky if you're able to grab those. Honestly going a bit further north you can find free parking and better walking situation to the restaurant. Cleared walks are always my preferred choice over the risking a fall on a frozen & slippery parking lot.",2018-12-08 23:35:37

When I called to report this, they sent a technician to investigate the problem. The technician was unprofessional and stayed far too long intentionally. He stated he ""forgot to leave"", whatever that means. I did not feel safe with him in my home. He was also unable to address the problem.  Of course, I am paying more than $100/month for poor service and maybe 5 channels.

As I was working this morning, my service was interrupted yet again and I decided I would call to request cancellation and my cancellation fees waived. It is now 2 p.m. and my first phone call to them was at 12:10 p.m. I was first disconnected and when I got a hold of someone, I was transferred and I waited on hold for 30 minutes. When I finally got a hold of someone from Loyalty, they stated they wouldn't be able to waive my fees because I didn't document my problems correctly. I spoke with a supervisor who stated if I don't have a technician come out or trade in my modem, they cannot help me with the cancellation fees. Given it takes at least an hour of my time to work with Xfinity via phone, and I do not want another technician in my home, I haven't called on a daily basis to report my problems. They would not accept screenshots or emails of my service interruption messages. 

 I understand that notion from a business perspective however, I do not feel safe with another technician in my home and I don't want to deal with replacing my brand new modem. He asked that I call each time my service is interrupted and I explained to him that it takes at least an hour for someone to address my call. He stated their hold times are five minutes long, which we all know isn't true. As I'm typing, I'm on my 20th minute (on my sixth outgoing call to them today) holding for someone else to revise my cancellation date (they said they can't revise it over email). My experience has been utterly frustrating and I will never be their customer again. P.S. I signed up with Century Link in a matter of five minutes online and for half the price.",2019-01-05 21:07:41

Wanted a pancake breakfast so I went in for a meal. Sat at the counter early Sunday 8:00am the place had few patrons. Prompt service and placed my order. After a few minutes orders began coming up, omelets and such. I watched four plates come up then what looked to be mine. Had to be more to be more than a minute or two but eventually another waitress shows and gets her orders as I say out loud ""I see mine."" One of three the cooks comes from behind the grill,  gets my order and gives it to me as I state ""Well at least one guy is on the ball"". So get this, the cook has witnessed my lack of service and takes initiative but I have to ask him for syrup and butter. The other waitress is now helping and gives him the butter to give to me. Now it's this butter that pushed me over.  It's frozen and in individually wrapped and DENTED little frustrating packages. Let me tell you what a bitch it is to try and unwrap these when they are DENTED and FROZEN solid, when all you want is hot pancakes, hot food in general. The butter gets all over your fingers, a freaking mess. Should've gotten up and walked out then and there. Hell if you can't figure out butter then.....but I was hungry. So I got to my meal, eggs are eggs, unremarkable. But the sausage links that were pre cooked at 6:00am need to be heated thru before plating. These were not and couldn't have cooled off that much while sitting on the counter or for the minutes it took me to unwrap the frozen butters. A server should know better than to give DENTED and FROZEN butter to a customer. These should be thrown out or allowed to thaw. They cannot be unsealed without ripping when they are DENTED and FROZEN. I left cash on the counter to cover the meal and walked. Later I did call mgr ""Dillon"" who offered to comp my meal for my email.....no thanks. Too pissed for a repeat performance. Bisbee BC is way overrated. Staff

The bartender and wait staff were rude and condescending and once you address their attitude they act like children and run off. I've never had a bartender treat me with so little respect and when addressed about it tell me it's because he's busy(with 4 other people sitting at the bar mind you) and then proceed to blatantly ignore me for the rest of the time! But this just must be how they train their employees because when we asked the food runner for condiments because NONE came with our meal (I was told since I didn't ask for salad dressing it came with none, oh and the tartar sauce that it said it came with on the menu, didn't get that either because he didn't like us maybe? I'm not sure) he told us to ask the bartender because he's too busy and it's not his job! We then asked the bartender and he refused to get them so we had to ask another bartender. And once you ask for a manager, they don't even care to hear what you have to say and act like they can't believe you had the audacity to ask to speak with them. Management essentially blames you for their employees inability to do their job and will actually say ""I don't know what you want me to do about it"" It's the blind leading the blind in this place. The most hilarious thing about this entire situation is that once we said something to the bartender about his attitude he was giving great service to everyone around us, which was kind of pathetic since that's the kind of service people should expect in the first place. PSA!!! If you're a miserable and nasty person, don't be a bartender. They're lucky the majority of their revenue comes from drunk college kids because treating your patrons like they're second class citizens doesn't work for most adults. I didn't even get a chance to get the bartender who was hot and bothered or the manager who had the ""better than thou"" attitude because they didn't introduce themselves and I hardly got a chance to speak to either of them.
Last thing, the food was great and Anthony did a great job of taking care of us after our issue with first bartender. This review was just about the service.",2018-05-21 11:55:55

I ordered 15 wings, 5 hot, 5 honey Haberno and 5 Garlic Parm. The cashier rung me up and it came to $19.43. 

A few moments later she comes back with the Assistant Manager Joe, if that's his real name. He comes over after I'm already charged and says they cannot make just 5 of one flavor. 
Did I want to make it a second Order of 10. I said no. He tells me he will refund me the money for the 5 and I will get the refund in a few business days. 

I asked him, would it not be easier to not inconvenience the customer to simply fulfill the order and have the cook do what I ordered. He becomes irate and rude and gets nasty with me. Cutting me off and asking me do I want the order or not. I asked him why he was giving me attitude. If the cashier can ring me up for the order that way then it means the order can be done. He says have you ever made a mistake. I said yes but this is an inconvenience for me, when you can simply ask the cook to cook the wings. I have been coming here since they first opened. And during wing night they would do amounts of 5. 
He again gets nasty with me and says we haven't done a f'ing wing night in 4 years. Do you want the order or not? I say again this is bad customer service and he goes and returns the entire order. He comes back and dropped my card in my face. 

And tells me he's going to enjoy eating my wings. I said okay i can get wings anywhere. He says to me i get off at 8pm.  I said okay thanks. 

This level of disrespect and attempt to bully and intimidate me is not how I believe you want your restaurant represented is the message I sent the owner Dave Goldman.

This was uncalled for. I will be leaving my review on every platform until I get a resolution.

I guess that would be my best way to describe TCWT.

We made last minute plans to do the Philly tourist thing last week and we had a certificate for a walking tour that was won via a PBS auction, yes I'm slightly a Lib as I do support PBS, and I called to make a reservation.

The initial call was quick and easy and the reservation was made without a problem. (So I thought)

After that the lovely wife told me that we had to change the day of the tour from a Thursday to a Friday to accommodate her work schedule as she would be unavailable until Thursday afternoon and that was too late as the tour times are 10am, Noon, and 2pm.

When I called the second time and explained, now to a different person, that I needed to change the date of our reservation she told me that she couldn't find my initial reservation in their system and that she would have to forward my reservation request on to another person, who was unavailable, and that I shouldn't worry as all I needed the day of the tour was our certificate and that the guide would be expecting us.

Fast forward to the day of the tour and I was told to meet the guide at the Visitor's Center 15 minutes early before the tour except there was one problem:

Where was the guide?

We asked six different people at/around the Visitor's Center about this walking tour company and/or where the tour meets and/or would the guides have a logo shirt on and no one knew anything.

Finally I was able to find their phone number right before the tour started but when I attempted to call their number I was initially kept on hold and then was prompted to leave a message.

By this time it was after the tour start time and if this tour existed we didn't see it as we were in the Visitor's Center from 15 minutes prior to the supposed start time to 15 minutes after without seeing anything that looked like a walking tour.

Ride the Ducks Tour, Yes
Big Red Bus Tour, Yes
Constitutional Walking Tour, No

Now if I would have paid full price I would have been pissed but we paid pennies on the dollar to PBS compared with the full price charged and since there were numerous other things we already had scheduled that day there was no time to try and rebook later that day.

If we're back again this summer, doubtful, maybe I'll try and call for another reservation but at the very least I know that I helped out PBS a bit and it's just a case of live and learn with some companies that clearly don't have their crap together.",2012-07-30 05:08:30

Long gone are the days when I could drink all the beer, eat all the pizza and destroy all the donuts. Now, I have to be careful about such things. When I really *need* to indulge, I can... but how I pay for doing so. So, I don't indulge often. At least my belly is flatter. Sorta.

It came to pass that I had a friend in town and he wanted to see what the fuss was about Five Daughters. I told him of my transformative 5D experience a while back and he wanted in on the fun. Being a gracious host, I took him to the new-to-me Eastwood location and contented myself with finding joy with his joy. There would be no donuts for me, I thought.

I was wrong -- and I hadn't been so happy to be wrong in a while. After my friend ordered, the gentleman behind the counter asked me what I wanted. With a long face, I told him of my gluten-free belly and how I couldn't have donuts. Au contraire, mon frère, he replied.* 5D has paleo/gluten-free donuts! Wut?? Yaasss!!! Game changer. Now, before you get overly excited, the paleo donuts aren't the slap-your-mama experience of the 'regular' 100-layer variety but they're still very good. Expect these donuts to be denser than the other donuts at 5D. I ordered a chocolate-strawberry and a lemon blueberry donut. The chocolate-strawberry had bits of berry in the chocolate cake but the cake was very dense and not as chocolatey as I would have liked (I was expecting flourless chocolate cake realness). The lemon blueberry was a better hit. The lemon cake shone with the berry. Even though the cake was dense, it had flavor on its own that matched well with the fruit. 

I might be grading on a curve, but I feel good about the 4 stars. Yes, it's a relative rating. Yes, the paleo donuts don't compare to the out-of-this-world deliciousness of the original recipe.** Yes, the chocolate didn't make me sing the way I thought it would. But I am so appreciative of the fact that 5D took steps to include all diets in donut happiness. That kind of consideration goes a long way. Snaps.

This was the best part of my Half & Half experience.

We were greeted with a 15-minute wait. No problem. It was Saturday morning, after all. At 30 minutes we checked in with the hostess who assured us it was only a few minutes more. At 45 minutes, I started playing that scene from Seinfeld where Elaine takes an egg roll off of someone's table for $50. I would have done it for $25. At an hour, I started dreaming about a McGriddle (yep, it was that bad). At 75 minutes, with blood starting to come out of my ears, we asked if they could arrange a few tables on the patio. After working through a confounded look on the hostess' face, she reluctantly agreed.

It turns out that a particular group had finished their meal and spent the next hour just chatting. Despite that rudeness during a busy brunch scene, and the fact that that's what parks and coffee shops are for, it's the wait staff's responsibility to, politely, move those people along. If the wait is going to be an hour, fine. But don't tell me some sugary tale about 15 minutes.

However, we're seated now and good food can right a lot of wrongs. Of course, it didn't in this case, but it CAN. As a Midwestern boy transplanted to the west coast and the land of Tofu, I was really looking forward to some more traditional food. ""One biscuits & gravy, please!"" I said to our waiter. Nope. They're out of gravy. At breakfast. In fact, no less than three of my group's orders couldn't be fulfilled because they were out of food. They were even out of Diet Coke. Sure. 

Somewhere, the Grinch who stole breakfast is up on his mountain with that dog having a good laugh.

The food we did order took ... a while. It was around minute 40 of my pondering into how well I could satiate my appetite on ice cubes alone that the food arrived. Well, part of it. A few plates showed up. A few more, about five minutes later. After about 10 minutes, when everyone's food was good a cold (delicious!) the remaining plates arrived. 

I will say, our server was nice. The wait time may not have been his fault. But to find positive points in this experience is like trying to justify the Carter Administration. 

I understand that the restaurant turns into Medianoche at night, but I'll never try it. If I get slapped in the face in the morning, why get punched at night?

We came in not having any idea about what we were about to experience. My god it was an experience. All that we knew was that it was somewhat pricey, and not a deterrent in the slightest, but we always question if it was worth it at the end of the night. It was. 

We started off with the hummus and mussels. The hummus was amazing, that what we had first and then the mussels were brought out. We had to stop ourselves otherwise we wouldn't have had room for the mussels, much less the rest of the meal. Those mussels were to die for. They were encapsulated in a cream sauce that was made by the gods themselves. I honestly have no idea what was in it other than saffron and cream but it was amazing. We ended up asking our server if we could take it back with us. So good! 

After stuffing ourselves with a pound of mussels and hummus we decided to split one of the signature entrees. We enjoyed the paella and a side of the couscous royale. So much food, such little stomachs. The lamb was falling apart, so tender. Think about the best pot roast you've ever had in your life, and then make it ten times as good and served over a fragrant bed of rice. It was life changing. 

Then for dessert we decided to go for the baklava seeing as to how it was smaller than the other options. We both thoroughly enjoyed the plating with powdered sugar and the three crunchy, sweet, nutty bars of heaven. We ended up splitting the third one right down the middle because it was just that good. Never before had I ever commented on uneven cutting of a shared food, but this, this had to be completely equal. 

Our service was absolutely phenomenal. I can't recall our servers name, but he was an older gentleman who definitely knew his way around the menu and was very helpful explaining everything to us. Never did we have to ask for a thing, it just magically appeared, but yet he wasn't overbearing or checking on us too frequently. I could not have asked for better customer service. 

So thankful to all of the staff at the Saffron Cafe for going above and beyond our expectations. We will definitely be back again!",2016-10-23 20:33:12

However, even on the scale of Chinese buffets in the world, the food is pretty bad. I've been to buffets all over this great state of Pennsylvania and this has some of the driest, mealiest meat and substances known. The salt level of my blood is rising and rising. If you are a senior citizen reading this, the lunch deal is probably fine. Otherwise, with a drink and tax, you're over $11 for a normal adult human. Not worth it in my opinion. You have a ""Western"" food station of meatloaf and meatballs, both of which I'm not sure are made of actual four legged mammal ""meat"", as the meatballs had a very bizarre interior and it wasn't just overcooked beef or pork. Also on this station is pizza, mashed potatoes, slabs of dry ribs and gigantic heating tray troughs of melted and steaming butter and gravy.

Another station is completely fried. Burnt french fries, capitalist ""Meat-X"" derived chicken nuggets, pure ""fry"" exoskeleton moltings that passed for egg rolls, sweet & sour chicken, crab rangoons, etc.

Another is generic Chinese american things. Chicken and broccoli, General Tso chicken, black pepper chicken, beef stir fry, etc. The black pepper chicken was probably the ""best"" thing I ate here, which isn't saying much. It was the only thing in the entire place that had a taste of any spice or seasoning beyond ""salt"" and ""something vaguely sugary"".

Last entree line is fish. I didn't touch any of these as every section - blue fish, baked oysters, octopi, were completely full and I went around 2PM. As much as I love seafood, I am fearful of shopping plaza seafood that's been out for 4+ hours and where every patron is over 70 human life cycles long.

There's also a grim salad bar that looks like NASA sent a transmission into space in the late '60s with the sections of a ""salad bar"" and aliens received it 5,400 light years beyond our galactic arm and tried to duplicate it with none of the Earthly ingredients available.

On the side is a sushi bar. I tried a few roll pieces and they looked and tasted a dried up skeleton's spine that was dug up from the desert, canned, then re-hydrated two millennia later.

Dessert is featured as well. There was pumpkin pie (a frightening sight when it's an 80 degree day in April), chocolate cake, a variety of diabetes inducing sugar buns and of course, pudding.

Our first time there we had the Duck confit, blue chip deal (fresh potato chips tossed in melted blue cheese and topped with balsamic reduction) and chicken fried steak. that was our first trip and it was over a year and a half ago. The Duck confit was probably the best we have ever had, or rather I had had as he had never tried duck before. I ordered the duck he ordered the CFS, he ended up stealling most of my Duck. The CFS was ok, nothing spectacular just average. The Blue chip deal, was amazing! So good we ended up back there taking a friend a few weeks later, loved that they overheard me say the only thing that a place in DC did that I loved was they added steak pieces to the top, they happily offered to do so and it was again amazing! I love there is generally a stout or porter on Nitro. 

The next few times we went the chips didn't seem fresh they skimped on balsamic and Blue cheese. We ordered stuffed mushrooms that were served to us cold and the cheese was already a solid glob, I asked teh bartender if that was standard or if they are supposed to be warm he rolled his eyes took the plate and either had them reheated or made new. They were so so, I probably wouldn't order them again. 

Stopped going for a few months after that and after some friends having a bad experience, which I did email the managment about so not just bad mouthing on yelp. 

We did go back one night because I was craving the Blue cheese chips, was sad to see Duck was no longer an option and hasn't been since the initial viist. The chips were again really good and Youngs was on Nitro. So we tried a few weeks later and back to the chips being mediocre. The next visit we tried the nachos which were good. The other night I was craving the blue cheese so we went in. They were out of every beer he asked for, and I get IPA's are all the rage lately but 7 or 8 of the drafts were IPA's the only stout or porter was Youngs. So he ordered a cocktail. I got a Blueberry Mojito which seemed to be missing a few of the ingredients that the menu listed (obvious ones like Blue Curaco) we got the chips. The chips were cold, oily and just blah. Had to ask for extra balsamic as it managed to only make it onto about 5 of the chips on the plate. 

I want to like the place and I do when its good, the problem is it isn't always good and I am hesitant with the prices to go in not knowing if its going to be good or bad that night.",2013-05-24 18:24:37

Talk about a tiny hole in the hall joint.  Frangelli's is tucked into the anchor spot of a building on the corner of Ritner and 9th in a traditionally Italian part of town.  Frangelli's began in 1947 and has occupied the same space since 1994 (they were in their original location on 9th and Jackson from '47-'94) as such they are your stereotypical neighborhood icon such as the ones found throughout the Eastern Seaboard (everyone knows everyone and everything about everyone in the neighborhood).  It is quaint, it is homey, it is warm and welcoming to strangers and obvious tourists.

As we approached the counter a lovely lady by the name of Candice asked if she could help us.  Stating we were new in town, she proceeded to tell us everything, and I mean everything about Frangelli's and their menu.  She knew the place inside and out and was very helpful as well as exceedingly polite.  She said we should be sure to try their ""Franoli"" and their Hamentash.  Taking Candice at her word, I asked for a Franoli, some almond cookies and Hamentash. 

What exactly is a Franoli?  Well, to put it mildly, it is the best pastry item in the Galaxy, if not the Universe.  This little concoction of nummy for your tummy is a doughnut filled with cannoli filling.  The doughnut is so soft and springy, it is almost like cake instead of donut and it is stuffed with the most delicate, sweet cannoli filling I have ever had.  This is AMAZING!!  This, alone, is worth the airfare.  

Forcing my attention away from this Kingly food, I told myself that I had to at least try the other items, after all, I was ""working"" here.  To that end, next up were the Almond Cookies.  Have you ever had a Bear Claw?  Have you ever had marzipan?  If you have, imagine the two of them combining like Foles to Jeffery in last years Super Bowl.  This is a match made in the heaven.  The buttery goodness and subtle almond notes were just astounding.  This is truly a masterpiece of a cookie.  Finally, I turned my attention to the order of Hamentash.  Hamentash?  A filled triangular shaped cookie associated with the Jewish holiday of Purim, or Haman in a South Philly Italian neighborhood?  I had to have my researcher call and ask about that one.  Lauren explained to my lackey that back in the day the neighborhood was more mixed than it is now, with lots of Jews and Italians roaming the streets.  Even today, they get a lot of Jewish customers walking over from 7th.   As with everything else in the place, this too was made by hand. Hamantashen traditionally come in one of two forms, either soft and doughy or hard and crunchy.  These were an exemplary example of the latter.  The cookie was baked to the perfect doneness and while it was crunchy, it did not fall apart upon biting.  Instead, it crumbled in my mouth like so much mana.  The filling was delightful, obviously homemade and quite honestly blew my conception of a cookie right out the window.  

Sadly, we had reached the end of our order and it was time to leave.  Checking around one last time for any crumbs, we said our Goodbyes to Candice and exited onto Ritner.  Taking a moment to savor what we had just experienced, I couldn't help but feel like one of the neighborhood for a brief second.  OK, a microsecond as I was calmly asked to ""move it fat boy"" by a local passing by on the sidewalk.  You have to love this city!!  

The Big Boy says, ""If you are anywhere near Philadelphia or the East Coast in general, make this a priority stop.  Frangelli's is 5 star all day every day!"" #iamthebigboy #bigboydiningout",2018-12-28 19:11:48
rqg_qqB7EVrIsHbK9Gc57w,QdhsBITt2VqQzwNxRu4QjQ,X4KMO8a-R7mqXNXo2gXAPw,4.0,1,0,1,"I was worried about our trip to St. Pete's being a drag considering the reviews here for the RumFish/Guy Harvey wing of the Tradewinds Resort.  While the halls do have a whiff of sunscreen and a hint of mildew from wet people running around, our room did not smell.  We had a gulf front suite with a balcony.  The room was dated, but not in bad shape.  It was tight quarters.  Fortunately there were only three of us.  It's one of the rare rooms we've had that didn't have something broken.  Let's talk about the good, bad, and in-between.
Good - the rate!  Compared to rooms at the Tradewinds, RumFish was a deal.  I couldn't find anything else in the area outside of an AirBnB that could touch the price for staying at a resort-ish property.  This end of Saint Pete's Beach is very pleasant.  Plenty of off property dining options within a mile or two.  You could walk it if you're not worried about getting rained on.  Being a part of the Tradewinds resort fee was pleasant.  Our daughter didn't go down the inflatable slide on the beach.  We did take a ride in the paddle boat through their on property canals.  We utilized the cabanas down on the beach too, although they were nicer in the morning than in the evening when the sun could get under the shade.  Beef O'Brady's over at the Tradewinds had some good food at a moderate price for being on property.
Bad - I didn't appreciate getting a firm pitch for going to their timeshare within 10 minutes of being in the door.  They're lucky I came this time.  Wait until I think I like a place before you ask me to give you more money.  I wasn't a fan of the Gulf Shore Grill.  The food was barely passable and it was nearly $100 for a $30 sandwich lunch (we did have some $10 drinks that helped drive up the price).  The ice machine was inconveniently located way on the other side of the building on another floor.  On our next to last day, someone called pretending to care about our stay, but it was another swing from the timeshare people.  They dangled a $200 ""getaway"" back to the resort that included having to sit through their pitch.
In Between - RumFish Grill was fun to see the aquarium, but it looked like it would be a madhouse during open hours.  We went around 10am and were able to check out the aquarium.  It was cool.  The parking was a challenge as slots were minimal and they were made for some old European car that's half the width of a normal American car.  Our door started making noise around 10:30 one night.  I looked out the peep hole and there's a fellow with a baby buggy trying to get in.  I figured he didn't realize he had the wrong room.  It was when the resort employee with the crib was about to open the door that I opened up and asked what's happening.  I talked with him the next day.  They gave him our room number, but instead, he was a few floors higher and on the other side of the building.  That's a little sloppy.
Overall, there's nothing wrong with the RumFish.  It's a decent deal for what you get.",2019-06-24 15:35:51

I booked with this venue in the beginning of my engagement after meeting with Pat. He spent the entire meeting discussing all the lovely renovations that would be done prior to our wedding taking place.  Pat said that the renovations would be done over the summer (well before my wedding would take place in June the following year).  A few months later (after little communication from my initial meeting with Pat) we had our food tasting.  The food tasting was an absolute disaster. From the food being disgusting and bland and tasting like high school cafeteria food, to receiving a $60 check afterwards because our mothers came.  We were completely livid.  But the icing on the cake was the zero renovations that still hadn't been done, months after we paid the deposit. The very next day I left Pat a voicemail and sent him an email.  I'm a paralegal, so I'm extremely thorough and attentive to detail.  I emailed Pat all of my correspondences with Melissa showing that she never stated that I couldn't bring our 2 freaking parents and asked for the full refund.  I also mentioned the renovations that he promised that clearly weren't ever done.  Pat became a completely different person.  He said the food tasting was only for the bride and groom.  I explained that it was never stated in any paperwork that it was complimentary for just the two of us.  Our mothers paid for the wedding, and I don't eat meat so I would like more than one person's review of this food.  I also asked how can you charge for additional food, when you still presented us with one plate for everyone to share.  He said it's their policy and no refund would be issued.  Then I asked about the renovations and why the venue looked exactly the same.  First, he acted as if he never made any promises about renovations, then after I kept asking several questions, he back tracked and said that it's hard to get the licenses for renovations in the county.  So basically, no renovations would be done prior to my wedding.  At this point I was absolutely livid.  First if you are going to nickel and dime me now for freaking $60 then this is going to be a long process.  Second, I would have never ever booked with that venue based on how it looked.  Everything in the ballroom looked outdated, the carpet was dingy and old, and the venue as a whole looked old, and I literally had stopped looking at venues based off the lies Pat had told us. So, I told Pat that I was unhappy and would rather book somewhere else and that I wanted my deposit back.  Initially, he said no.  Then when I threatened legal action, he gave us our deposit back immediately.
THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS DONT BOOK WITH PAXON HOLLOW. From Pat being a con artist, to Melissa they are just horrible and honestly seem as if they don't fully comprehend customer service.  Two weeks after firing Paxon Hollow, I booked with Regal Ballroom and we just got married on June 10th.  They were literally the polar opposite of Paxon Hollow. Netty, and Chris were so amazing and attentive. The food at the food tasting was amazing, we were allowed to bring our moms, the entire venue was brand new and by the wedding day they had even made some tweaks to the bridal suite, we were able to keep the same date as before, had a million times better customer service, and paid a lot less then Paxon Hollow.  

P.S. See Dan's May 2017 review on wedding wire where he also outlines the poor customer service, the horrible food, and the ""renovations"" that Pat is promising to everyone",2017-06-20 15:30:43

We were scheduled for an appointment between 8-12 on a Friday. By 3 PM, we still hadn't heard anything and left messages for him. We finally heard back around 4, and he said he couldn't make it out but would come Saturday. We understood that things happen, but thought it was odd that we didn't even get a call to reschedule and that we had to reach out to him to find out where he was. My husband and I both work, so my husband ended up having to take a full day off instead of half a day.  He showed up on time Saturday and knew immediately what was wrong with the washer and said he would order the part right away and that he would call us the following week to set up an appointment to install the new part. That week came and went and we heard nothing. We tried calling, but he never answered and his mailbox was full so we couldn't leave a message. We finally had enough by Wednesday the following week and called GE directly. Since our case was ""open"" with James, they had to transfer us 4 times (we were on the phone with them either on hold or being transferred for an hour and a half) while they tried to reach him and figure out what was going on. Someone at GE was able to reach him and he just told them he was not servicing our washer/dryer. When they tried to ask him why, he hung up. Luckily he told us what part was broken when he looked at the washer so GE is shipping it overnight and having a different company come out in a few days. 

I don't know what happened. My husband and I were very understanding when he didn't show up for our scheduled appointment and we seemed to have a good rapport with him when he was looking at it. We even joked about what a pain it was to have a 3 month old and a ""brand new broken washer.""

He definitely seemed to know what he was doing, and perhaps this was an issue with his contract with GE or some relationship with them, but as the one with the broken washer, I feel like I was left out to dry and had to clean up a mess that wasn't mine to clean up. I have plenty of other appliances that aren't under warranty and based on his customer service as a contractor for GE, I will look elsewhere when they need service in the future.",2015-09-30 17:29:25
U2Ez18jcNr1G1q8d-6Ldqg,QHdS9exSysg08eqs1YUsgQ,tYCok-NtWvg8_k7woeB83w,3.0,6,0,1,"So I'm not going to sugar coat it: In case you didn't already know, Grand Lux Cafe is an upscale version of the Cheesecake Factory. (They're run by the same company; the dessert menu even features some of the Cheesecake Factory's more basic selections.) We went for the training/sneak preview event before their official opening next week, so despite having a hugely extensive (and overwhelming) menu like Cheesecake Factory, we were given a limited menu comprised of certain items so that the kitchen could practice preparing different dishes. 

We were allowed to choose 2 appetizers. My dining partner picked a calamari salad and I got Vietnamese Chicken summer rolls. The summer rolls were AMAZING! I love eating them at Vietnamese restaurants and I love making them at home. They were the perfect treat on such a hot day! The menu states that it's served with a peanut sauce but they also gave me a Thai sweet chili sauce; both complimented the rolls perfectly. And for being an appetizer, the calamari salad was ginormous! It had me nervous about what my entree salad was going to look like. (NB: The menu on their website lists it as a ""small salad""; it was easily enough for 2 people.) My only complaint is that the calamari was fried and warm. While it does state this in the menu description (crispy calamari), I just think a cold calamari salad might have been a better fit with the ""upscale"" environment. (But I guess I don't create the menu, lol!) 

Then things went downhill when it came to entree-time. We get it - this is new for everyone, the kitchen was very busy, etc. So while our waiter kept assuring us that our food would be out shortly, we expected it to at least come as we requested. My dining partner ordered his burger medium-rare; it was fully cooked to slightly well done. And my southwestern salad (which was also super big, and served in an awkward oval shaped dish as opposed to a big bowl like the calamari salad) looked promising... until I moved my tomato wedge around to slice it and saw what appeared to be a tiny green string of lettuce, but upon closer inspection, seemed like a piece of plastic - perhaps from a prep item or a scouring pad. And then, I found another string...and another string. 

One of the 'seasoned' wait staff who was present for the training process noticed my confusion with the salad and came over to inspect the foreign object with the manager, who then apologized profusely and promptly removed my salad. He asked if there was anything else that he could get me in the meantime; I was ok at the moment so he said he was going to bring me a brand new salad to take home - and then we were given 2 $25 gift cards as well for our trouble. The situation was definitely handled tactfully and he went above and beyond to make sure that I didn't leave with a bad taste in my mouth. 

Oh! I almost forgot - Dessert! We were allowed to choose 2 desserts but the one dessert my dining partner wanted, they had run out of earlier. (A banana caramel bread pudding which sounded amazing!) I wanted to order the ""create your own cupcake"" which consisted of 4 cupcakes, 3 frostings (peanut butter, vanilla/coffee? - not sure. I kind of got a hint of coffee, and a rich chocolate) and assorted toppings (sprinkles, chocolate chips, peanuts, toffee chips) - so that was more than enough for both of us. The peanut butter frosting was out of this world and our waiter, the pro-waiter and the manager kept coming over and telling us that was their favorite too! 

While I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again (especially since Cherry Hill is kind of out of the way from my neighborhood in Philadelphia), it's definitely a perfect fit for the suburbs, and a nice dining experience for anyone who has a lot of picky, indecisive eaters in their family or social circle.",2012-07-07 16:10:55
1hPJXxnZ7-dIJlv-pbOupg,_bl5PELSGtYjrh0hi8X2ag,UCQivo4foc1hsn2KCTdhHQ,3.0,2,0,1,"An updated review after living here for 5 months:

5 stars for rooftop - gym, pool, clubroom; overlook of Centennial park is picturesque

5 stars - location is convenient, easy to get anywhere in city, and being right next to the park is great. 

5 stars - apartment noise levels - I don't hear anything from my neighbors or footsteps from above or things like that. The only 'noise' I would hear during the summer would be the live concerts on Centennial Park:)

4 stars for maintenance (now, things are often taken care of same day, which is a welcome change)

4 stars for office staff, improved as first impressions after signing lease was 2 stars, new day to day staff is more competent; I initially hated this place because of the leasing and move-in experience including the apt issues below - it seemed like you were talking to the wall at times; now it's much more tolerable/normal; one time several months ago, the key fob for entrance/garage stopped working and it seemed like no one cared for 48 hours - this should have been more of an emergency, but I don't think this will happen with the newer folks.

3 stars for media - 5 stars for Internet included as no issues with that, but 1 star for TV service - so avg 3 stars (TV is only free if you live in the 90s and like your analog cable channels:) :  $67 / month if you want the usual HD channels and DVR ($38 if HD without DVR) - Pavlov media, which provides this apartment's internet/TV, has horrible customer service (google reviews for them). It took 2 months and over a dozen phone calls for them to fix issues with TV service. Wow. Periodically, I still have to wait 10 minutes to reset the Dish network receiver because of a 'no signal warning.'

2 stars for apartment quality of interior finishes - this was a surprise, turned out that these are 'faux' luxury apartments. I had over a dozen requests to bring the apartment up to a decent standard: maintenance trimmed 3 doors so they would shut, fixed a 6 foot long crack in the sealing, peeled glue from all the edges of the 100% particleboard cabinets, replaced vinyl 'plank' of flooring. Remaining issue is that dishwasher is sub-par -noisy and doesn't have a second washarm - I've adjusted by running the 'heavy' cycle every time, which does an average job. Recently, have had a couple vinyl planks start peeling. It's unfortunate that the finishes of the individual apartments do not match that of the rooftop. 

2 stars for building entrance/layout- awkward ground floor plan (mailroom in a random corner of the building, 1 elevator in main corner of building, no real lobby). I think they should demolish two of the first floor apartments once the leases are up and transform that into a mailroom and nice lobby. Or separate the leasing office so corner entrance remains always open. Right now, the entrance to the apartment leaves much to be desired (the leasing office entrance is closed when leasing office is closed, so instead, there are a few random, unadorned doors to welcome you and your guests).

Other issue: fire alarms - see the review someone else posted. Seems that they are working on it.  

As you can tell, this apartment complex initially left much to be desired, but things are generally headed in the right direction.  For the rent/sq footage you pay here, you will have high expectations which may be unmet in terms of quality of individual apartments. When the time comes to renew my lease, I will definitely check out what else is out there; maybe I'll stay, maybe I'll move.",2014-11-18 05:03:22
XBVpDwfstbdqYJnOSCMlPQ,go57kIEH6c6ab_-LXcGRrw,uMOW0LOaNaA_hn6wRYUc1w,1.0,3,0,0,"I hired this company to replace a damaged gutter.  It seemed like a straight-forward job.  The crew shows up unannounced and removes the old gutter and downspout.  Then they have no idea how to install the new gutter onto the brick building.  After several hours they confess that they are a 'green' team with no experience (thanks for sending them out to my house) and they call for help.  Another team arrives and has the tools to attach the gutter, they make quick work of it and leave.  Great I have a gutter.  Now the 'green' team is on to installing the downspout.  Guess what?  They don't have the tool to install that to the brick.  They apologize and say they'll come back another day for the downspout.  It's suppose to rain the next day so I demand they do something to keep the water from washing down the side of my house.  They install a 'diverter' to direct the runoff away from the house.  They are packing up when I ask about the gutter screens that are suppose to be on the gutter.  Yep, they forgot those.  So out comes the ladder again and they put those on.  I can't see their work so I assume they are doing that correctly.   

Two days later, after a day of rain, someone else shows up unannounced and installs the downspout, sort of.  The upper 10 feet isn't attached to the house at all and sticks out away from the house by about 5 inches.  It looks ridiculous.

I also notice a lot of water at the back of the house so I climb up on the roof myself just to check the work I couldn't see from the ground.  The gutter screens are on, sort of.  There are gaps in them, they are falling down into the gutter.  There are already a few leaves in the gutter. AND the roofing on the house is over the top of the screens blocking water from actually going INTO the gutter along most of its run.  Its a windy day and the wind is now actually blowing under the roofing and lifting it off the house.  Great.  I remove the screens, trim the roofing to go around the gutter supports and drain into the gutter.  I then reinstall the screen properly.  

Meanwhile, I am getting several calls a day to pay the remainder of the bill.  I explain to them what the issues are and even send them photos.  I am assured they will take care of it.

Fast-forward about 7 weeks.  Someone finally shows up, unannounced and says they are here to fix the problems but he has no idea what those problems are.  I'm at work, in a meeting, when he calls me.  I have to then explain again what I've explained before and been assured would be fixed.

So the guy fixed the downspout, sort of.  At least it is attached to the house now.  I told him not to touch the screen because I already fixed that myself.   And guess what, hours after leaving they are back to calling me/emailing me every couple of hours for their payment.  I had to wait 7 weeks, they can wait.

In a nutshell, this is a horrible company with inexperienced people being sent out to damage your house.  Do not use them.",2016-12-31 00:21:18

My lunchmates and I enjoyed taking in the atmosphere (paintings and decorations, and such), and after some discussion concluded that their official theme must be ""THE SOUTH...mostly.""
Garbage-can-sized glasses of water were brought out quickly as we perused the menus.  Unfortunately,  that's the last thing that happened with any speed.  So they lose a star there.
I was almost overwhelmed by the menu because there was so much going on.  You'd be hard-pressed to find somebody who wouldn't enjoy at least something from this collection of food. It's solid.  I considered something drenched in their Voodoo sauce, so I asked for sample and they obliged.  Nice work!  Really tasty sauce with a nice cajun zip to it (I imagine it to be badass with shrimp), but in the end, I was lured to a burger with the promise of gargonzola.  Done deal (sadly, no pun intended).
I ordered it medium, as is my custom, yet it arrived closer to well done than anything.  Bye bye other star!  Either they didn't care (so why ask!?!?), or were nervous about the mixed Andouille being left at all ""uncooked.""  I'm robbing them of a star for that maneuver either way.  It's my stomach, and I'll eat stuff as raw as I want, thank you.  But I digress, it was still a quality burger!  Terrific flavor, between the cajun spices, tangy mayo, funky gargonzola, and sweet carmelized onions.  A winner, even if a tad dry.
Given that I recently swore off french fries (I'm a recovering waffle fry addict - it's not funny), I opted for the cole slaw, and was pleasantly surprised. Great pairing with the burger.
I was able to pilfer a few greenbeans from my friend.  In a word: bacon. The beans were an afterthought, as they should be.  These bad boys of the veggie world really took one for the team as they were drownin' in bacon and molten hot drippings from something they were smoking back there.  At least, that's what my taste buds think. This side item is not for the faint of heart, or those already taking Lipitor.  They are for real.
The wait we endured to get the food was on the excessive side. Perhaps they were still cooking the crap out of my burger.  But I'm willing to believe it's not always like that.  So with 3 stars for the experience, there's still plenty of room to the upside for this joint.  With a little more focus, it could have pretty easily been a 4-star meal.   I'll be trying it again, hoping to save room for the desserts, or maybe some Voodoo action.",2011-01-11 19:07:01

Best in the Business!!!!

I promise you that you will not regret going here from start to finish!

My girlfriend (at the time) now Fiancé and I had a dreadful experience at another jeweler, which I will not mention. We went to this jeweler to only look and try to get an idea for what she liked in style and taste. Like most couples looking for the first time, we were extremely excited as it felt like a new adventure for us. . . But unfortunately even though we let them know this right from the start they began to be pushy and persuade her into what ring she needed, wrather then seeing what rings she liked, even going as far as separateing us during the process in order to have me put a down payment before we left...all the while leaving us both feeling uncomfortable and not even being able to enjoy the experience together.
Needless to say it was a complete Nightmare!!!

To be honest, neither of us wanted to even think about entering into another store to look together again.

A few months went by and I had a friend who asked me to go with him to pick up a ring he had purchased, reluctant I went along.

We entered Distinctive Diamonds and immediately it was a completely different atmosphere. Everyone was extremely personable, as soon as we entered the host greeted him by name and the associate he had been working with came over and did the same, letting him know that he would be right with him after he had finished with a couple he was working with.

It was incredible...after my experience I was astonished at the level of customer service and professionalism that this company displayed.

I came back a few times after and checked it out, never purchasing a thing but only looking.  Each time they greeted me by name and never pressured me to do a single thing.

I eventually began to work with the same associate that my friend had used and worked with, Matt Philley.

This guy did a phenomenal job at helping me find the perfect ring, all while working with me to see what would fit my soon to be fiancés taste best. I must have come there a dozen times without signing or being pressured to do a thing. I would recommend him to anyone... As a matter of fact I have, four of the guys in my wedding have since purchased rings at Distinctive and all have had the same to say.

Although I greatly enjoyed my experience working with Matt, it was a total team effort as there were multiple people from the Distinctive team that played a huge roll in helping me purchase my happily ever after custom ring.

The entire staff works together to ensure that you get exaclty what you want out of a ring, all while making each experience enjoyable.

I am extremely thankful for the entirety of the Distinctive Staff and team.



This place is a no brainer when it comes to choosing a Jewler and rest assured that each & every individual that works there will always go the extra mile to ensure that you are not only taken care of, but that every need of yours is met.

I'd like to quote from some of the other reviews on Yelp of this restaurant before I get into my personal experience: Christy M. gives 5 stars and says 'It is expensive, but that's just Indian food."" Ugh, Christy, have you ever been to Devon Ave in Chicago?  Cheap and amazing Indian food does go togehter but obviously not here at the Taj.  Rina K. gives 3 stars and states: ""All of the (vegetarian) curries had a slight spiciness, but ultimately just tasted the same. And were so very oily. So. Heavy."" Ugh, then Rina, how could you give 3 stars?  Is it really A-OK to have dishes that taste the same and are oily???  Barf.  David L.  gives 3 stars and states ""Everything is made-to-order, so be prepared to wait a little while."" Ugh, David, I don't mind waiting a little while, but 42 minutes after being seated we got our one order of vegetable samosa's.  Oh yeah, and the inside of the samosas were COLD!  Fried food that's cold, now that is really a special trick...this is not Alinea for goodness sake where one may expect a feat like that, where it is intentional, by the chef!

Now my turn...the Taj Mahal is located on the second floor of a poorly designed building in downtown Boise, take the escalator up if you must.  Once we were seated by the owner we were not acknowledged for at least 15 minutes.  The restaurant had a party of 6, a deuce and our party of 4.  What is it with Boise restaurants and their inability to greet customers promptly and get water to the table in less than 5 minutes?  This is the second Monday in a row that this has happened. Unacceptable.    

After waiting 15 minutes we thought it would be best if we placed our drink and dinner order at the same time; we ordered one appetizer and our three entrees for sharing.  The drink ordering was silly; the owner told one of our dining companions that water was only available for those under 16...ok fine, cute and funny, but then when I said I just wanted water he kept staring at me to add an adult beverage, which I didn't want...the other three people at the table requested beer and wine isn't that enough upselling from water? So one would think that after we ordered our drinks and waters we would get them soon afterwords.  We watied another 15 minutes after that!  30 minutes into the dininig experience and our first drinks arrive.  WTF?  The way the drinks were delivered would have been worthy of a Three Stooges episode: the owner carried two drinks at a time so he had to make three trips to our table to serve our party of four.  Why three trips?  Two beers, one trip.  One water and one white wine, second trip.  One water, third trip.  Curly, can you buy a beverage tray and do it all in one trip? 

The samosas arrived to our table, if you recall, 42 minutes after we were seated, with a runny, thin mint chutney, some raita, and a sweet tamarind dipping sauce.  They were cold so we asked for another order.  With the Jeopardy theme music running through my head I wondered if we were ever going to eat.  We should have left at this point and gone to another restaurant.  We didn't.    

Finally our food did arrive.  The Chiken Tikka Briyani was OK, but had too much of that fake tasting curry.  Chicken Korma and Chicken Tikka Masala were indistinguishable from eachother.  I think that's what Rina K. said about her veg enterees...same goes for the chicken dishes.  I couldn't discern much, if any difference between the two dishes.  Oh yeah, we had some Nan which was by far the best part of the meal.  In addition to the extreme wait to get our drinks and our food, the other aspects of service were deplorable.  Dirty dishes from the 6 top were never cleared from the dining room so we had a view of their stacked plates and empty glassware throughout our meal.  The deuce was desparately looking around to pay someone so that they could leave this hellish restaurant.  Another deuce was seated but wisely decided to leave before they got the full Taj treatment.  When we were finished with our meal our dishes were never cleared.  The owner asked if he could remove my dining companions partially finished beer glass while the remanants of our meals remained on the table.  He said 'no, I'm not done with my beer' and then the owner walked away from the table without removing the dirty dishes.  Inexplicable. 

In 1631, Shah Jahan was grief-stricken when his wife died during the birth of their 14th child.  In 2012 I was grief-stricken at having chosen to have dinner at Taj Mahal Boise.",2012-03-27 05:20:35

I think they hire people who are in the witness protection system. 

1. They lost my bed and just showed up with the mattress and box spring then proceeded to  harass yes actually harrassed me for a box of protection spray bs I never received.  

2. Like a dumb ass I went back again and ordered a couple more things because I am glutton for punishment! This time I  got several deliveries not 1 but several because they can't get it together after 4 calls to confirm address and date.  I took off work to get my complete order.  Or so I thought. 

3. The very expensive marble table was damaged! The delivery man did not want to take it back down stairs to the truck.  I was like um I don't have a truck! So he reluctantly  took it back after 2 calls to dispatch.  

4. another day  for  a couch and chair and they were knocking on some random door!
Ok..
I thought I was getting a chair with arms?!?
I made them take that back. Sigh.. I called dispatch and the witness protection women who was  nameless assured me I would get a  call later BUT guess what,? Yeah no, I don't matter. 
So the next  day I called and got transferred 6x. Not bs!
Ok I  drive there and ask why I have not received a call or refund credit for the returns? A young man figured out what had to be done.
I spent a good hour picking out another chair and table.  THEN wait for my credit card payment to be done again and to be told I'm not going to get the same amount of payments like my previous agreement.  
 Ok so I was thinking it's ok now and tomorrow I get my new items but I have to bother my family who was visiting to help me go pick it up to get home with a  missing freaking table top!!
I went back to be told that is a separate piece and cost!! I asked for the manager.
The original sales man and the management was as confused as me!
Yeah they took some of the cost off.
5.  But wait!!
I called today to confirm I was going to pick the table top and it's LOST!!!

We went to Santa Barbara to celebrate my 40th birthday with friends.  We picked the hotel because it was one of the nicest choices and was ocean front.  We were VERY disappointed!!!
We arrived to a beautiful property and had high hopes.  We got our room with a view of the parking lot, neither ocean or mountain view!  The room was very run down and looked dirty.  We immediately called the front desk to change, but since they were completely full, we were stuck.  It was also very loud since we were close to the exit and we could hear people in the hall quite clearly.  It was too loud, especially early in the morning!  
The service was terrible!  We went to enjoy the spa and were told to shhh the entire time!  the spa is a step-saver so you can't whisper too loud or you will disturb someone else.  They don't even have a jacuzzi in the spa!  We were told we could use the one by the pool with kids swarming all around.  Not quite the spa experience I was hoping for.  Did love my treatment though, just don't expect to spend the day there.  It's an in and out facility.  :(
In the evening after dinner we went to the patio bar that was ocean front with fire places.  The server was apparently ignoring us because it was several minutes before she came over that finally we went to the bar ourselves to get a drink.  About a half hour later we went back in to ask them to bus the area near the fireplace so we could move there.  It took 10 minutes for someone to come and do that.  Once she came and we moved, she was quite cheerful toward us, so we asked for a dessert menu.  She NEVER came back!!  About 15 minutes later we heard her tell the next table that she was sorry but they couldn't order because the kitchen just closed a few minutes ago.  
It wasn't as though they were tremendously busy.  It just seemed like they felt like because they were ocean front in Santa Barbara, they didn't have to have good service.  
We paid a pretty penny to stay in this resort and we will never go back!!  Expand the spa & make it bigger, remodel and clean the rooms, and mostly BE NICE to your customers.  They are the guests after all!",2012-08-22 05:07:43
FCCPm_t_HyeEsgnWgezJdw,KSDxLrlt8MMC3qhBNmMl0A,A9NqmUP1L3eU40a64q5Kdw,3.0,4,1,1,"This hotel is actually designed more like a two story motel, old yet renovated.  Located just off the 101 Freeway in Goleta, north of Santa Barbara, you exit Fairview.  The Goodland is on a busy shopping street yet tucked away.

This is a Kimpton brand boutique hotel that caters to hipsters and parents of UCSB students.
You will know you have arrived when you see a vintage Airstream trailer and ""woody"" station wagon parked in the entrance.  There is not a lot of space for check-in cars but their lot is ample nearby the front.

The lobby, as is the rest of the hotel, is warm and inviting, with a mellow California surfer vibe.
Soft earth tones and eco-friendly furniture, fixtures, walls, and non-carpeted flooring.

Did I tell you this is a super dog-friendly place?  5 star dog friendly. Bring your pooch!

Check-in was seamless with an inviting dispenser of sangria nearby.  It was delicious while I was waiting in line. The check-in staff were super friendly and helpful.  Be sure to know about the $28 mandatory resort fee before you pay your bill.  Not much of a resort, just a couple bars, two restaurants, an outdoor pool, and a small gym.  Free wifi which worked well.

THE PROS

Convenient location to find and close to UCSB.  A 15 minute drive to downtown Santa Barbara.

Rooms are spacious and airy, well appointed with the small gestures that show they care like bathrobes and a minibar and safe.

Parking is free and easy, you can park next to your room.

Dog friendly totally.

Inviting looking food, although I did not sample any.  Plenty of great restaurants within a 5 minute drive or even walk if you do not have a car.

Free bike rentals out front with locks

A short drive down Fairview to the ocean beach.

Excellent Samsung flat screen TV with about 25 channels.

Phone charger plugs next to the beds on the sides of the night tables (cool and convenient).

A newer model individual room heating/ air conditioning system with a high tech thermostat.

Free happy hour with wine @ 5 to 6pm in the lobby and free coffee in the AM.  Note: no coffee makers in the room.

Plenty of towels both in the room and at the pool.  Very high end designer toiletries, available for purchase.

Two story unit buildings make the vibe unusual and mellow, as opposed to the usual high rise hotel.

Fireplaces in the lobby and near the pool with comfortable furniture.

Plenty of dress drawers and a decent sized closet.

As part of the Kimpton boutique hotel chain, you are sure to attentively be pampered with a smile.

CONS

Thin walls and flooring that were not updated when this former two story motel was renovated.
I could hear my neighbor upstairs pee and flush.  The doors have not been replaced and multiple reviewers have complained they are difficult to close, with big gaps, making some guests not feeling secure.

The platform beds were not comfortable as you are missing out on the box spring effect you most likely take for granted.

With parking with in front of the units, this motel effect makes for a lot of noise, especially in the morning and late at night.

No work desk.  I guess millennials don't need one and literally use their laptop on their lap. I am
old fashioned and want a real desk with a real desk chair.

Cordless phone that was difficult to navigate.

The potential linger effect of dog urine and dander as ALL the rooms are dog friendly.  They did offer to do a deep cleaning if I had any issues.

The $28 resort fee is on top of the pricey hotel rack rate.  These rooms go for $250 to $500 depending upon the season. I snagged a room for $175 on Priceline name your own price.

THE BOTTOM LINE

I would definitely check out the 5 or 6 legacy non-boutique chain hotels that are very close by in the future for much less money.

Their sister hotel, the Kimpton Canary in downtown Santa Barbara sounds inviting for not that much more money than this Goleta hipster motel.  Does that sound snarky?",2017-03-27 03:50:14

To make things even more complicated, our sweet pup had recently been diagnosed with a mild case of Valley Fever and needed medications given to her twice per day. I told the veterinarian at Twin Peaks Vet about our predicament as we were there for our dog's appointment and they gave us Nunn Better's contact info and said they came highly recommended and were used by many of their clients.

I called Seneca a few days before we had to leave as this was when I had received her contact info and I explained to her that we were in a pinch and were very paranoid about leaving our dog this time around, so much so I had considered canceling the trip. We've had bad experiences with DogVacay, now Rover, in the past and will never use them again seeing as they aren't licensed or certified in any way. Upon speaking to Seneca, I could tell she knew her stuff. She's obviously been doing this a long time and clearly just loves what she does. She made me feel 100% at ease, which, admittedly, is quite a feat with the paranoid dog mom that I am. She was able to fit me in thankfully and scheduled a consultation to meet me that night at the place we've been staying. We scheduled her to come 2-3x/day depending on the day.

Seneca went above and beyond our expectations. She sent us regular detailed text updates per day with loads of pictures! She administered the meds our dog needed as well. She kept a detailed paper log of every visit with our pup and left it at our place for us to read. She snuggled with our pup, sat out on the porch and read with our dog, played with her, and made her feel loved. Seneca provided and left cleaning supplies for a little tinkle our pup took when she was excited one day, which she didn't have to do! Our dog was so happy to see us when we came and was obviously taken care of and in good spirits. We couldn't stop talking about how we will never go to any other dog sitting business again (when we are in this area). We wish Seneca would just move near us when we inevitably have to leave Arizona in December because now we do not want anyone else to take care of our pup but her! She provided us with something that is absolutely priceless and that's the peace of mind we needed to not drive ourselves crazy with anxiety on the rare occasions we cannot take our dog with us somewhere. 110% recommend Nunn Better to any pet owner who wants the absolute best for their babies.",2017-11-26 02:35:41

I love the new location...the historic building is gorgeous, and the decor is incredibly welcoming and soothing.  It feels almost like a ski lodge...exposed beams, fireplace, comfy furniture.  It's always nice and warm in there, which is great, because they do ask you to disrobe for facials (but they give you a soft blanket and a stretchy terrycloth wrap to wear).
I have never had any bodily waxing done there, but I have had my eyebrows waxed, and the waxing is professional, with really nice, warm (not too hot) rich wax.  Didn't hurt overmuch, either.  There was a lot of personal attention paid to the ""cleanup"" of stray hairs after the wax, as well...I appreciate a place that's willing to break out the tweezers to finish rather than taking off too much with wax.
The facials are exemplary.  I have only had Natalie do my facials, but I'm sure the whole crew is just as kind and thorough.  The products are natural and tailored to the individual.  I liked that the ingredients were recognizable and easy to pronounce...fruit acids scare me a lot less than chemicals.  We'll not lie...extractions hurt...but my last facial was on 1/10/12, and my skin is still noticeably cleaner, clearer and more radiant two weeks later.  I suffer from rosacea and I am easily reddened by harsh ingredients, and apart from the temporary redness incurred from extractions, I noticed no ill effects.  The best part is after the extractions...they really know how to temper a little pain with great relaxation.  Natalie gave me an excellent feet, hand and neck/shoulder massage while the soothing mask was doing its work on my face.  Easily the highlight of the experience.
Although she does not have a Yelp account, a dear friend of mine recently suffered from a horrible bout of unexplained acne that left her self-concious and confused, as she'd always had great skin.  The staff at Peaches accurately diagnosed her skin problem and prescribed her with a course of facials combined with product that have nearly cleared her skin completely in less than four months.  I know for a fact that she was so grateful to not have had to resort to Accutane or Retin-A to clear her skin.
I have recommended Peaches to friends, as well as my mother and sister, and I will continue to do so.  Peaches Skin Care is not inexpensive...but neither are shoes that don't pinch your feet, cosmetics that don't make your eyes itch, or blue jeans that make your posterior look amazing.  It is well worth it.",2012-01-24 02:29:32

I called precision garage door after hearing their ad on 92.3 Wil one weekend. I made an appointment  for a couple days later even though they had appointments available that same day even on weekends. Before my appointment the service technician, Peter, called to ask me about my situation so that he could get a handle on what was going on with my garage door. After we talked for a few minutes he determined that he did want me to waste the $69.00 appointment fee if the door was not acting up all the time. He gave me some great tips on what to check for without charging me a fee and told me to try that first and if it starts acting up again give them a call back and they would be happy to come out to see what was going on. I thought it was wonderful that he just didn't want to waste my money and that he gave me some tips and little things I could check before he came out and I was charged the $69.00 for the service call fee.
Sure enough I did the things Peter said and for like a week the garage door was working properly. Then a week later it started messing up again that's when I called Precision Garage Door again this time to schedule an appointment because by this time I had given up I really wanted to know what was wrong with my door. 2 days later Peter came back out and inspected the door and offered to fix my 30-year old wood door with all new parts but when I asked him for his honest opinion he said that even if he replaced all the parts he couldn't guarantee the door would work forever or even 6 months. When it cam down to it the price between replacing all the parts or the door in general was a couple hundred dollars so I had him setup an appointment replace the whole door and with the whole door came all the parts.

A week later Precision Door called me to setup my installation appointment and then a week after that my door was installed. The best thing was the guy who sold me the door was the same guy who installed it I love the congruency. I wasn't past from salesman to installer which is a great feeling.

M44zb_XVR6rqsFpqB_-3Rg,HFgy9PEwSnvaxjfc43DAng,E04CoucusNadKu3kM7Mzgg,1.0,7,0,0,"I took my kitties here for two years.

 The good: I never felt like I was being rushed in and out. The vet hung around to answer all of my questions, with detail. The in between: they're expensive. I'm willing to pay higher prices for superior service (especially when it comes to my kitties), but I don't think their services were worth the cost; hence, I do not take my babies to them any more. Sure, they have a fancy website, and I wasn't pushed out. The website has nothing to do with quality, but only with appearance, and I've found a good, knowledgeable and friendly vet at a better price. 

The bad: on three separate occasions, THEY FORGOT ABOUT US. One time we were waiting in the exam room for 30-45 minutes, for them to come back and take some blood. I hung out, reading a book, playing with my kitty, until I realized how much time had passed. I popped my head out and a few people rushed by, and I eventually got someone's attention and they told me that they had forgotten to communicate with each other, and the appropriate person would come in to take some blood in a minute. The second time wasn't for as long, but still, this is a silly pattern that they should be organized enough to avoid. I popped my head out early and prevented it from being any long. The third time I was in there for an hour and a half, waiting for them to bring me one of those cardboard carriers because my carrier had broken on the way in. AN HOUR AND A HALF. They told me it may take a while, so I got comfortable and was reading while my cat chilled out. They apologized in words, though their tone displayed no care and in deed, all they did was give me a $2 bag of treats.
 
The worst: I adopted my second cat after I found her, abandoned, on the street. I brought her in and they told me that she would have to have 4 or 5 of her teeth removed because they had begun rotting from her time on the streets, and it was going to be a quite pricey operation. I asked them if it was hurting her, when it would need to be done, etc., because I was in a bit of a bind at the time. They told me within a month or two and that, while not hurting her at present, it was ""affecting her quality of life."" My heart broke, and I wanted to get it done asap. The next month, I took her to another vet (this is the first time I had taken either of my kitties anywhere else) to see how much the surgery would cost her elsewhere. They said that she did not need an operation, that her teeth were taking care of themselves, and would be great with just some more time. I was skeptical, but she still didn't seem to be in any pain, so I held of on going to back Prytania and scheduling the surgery. Sure enough, her teeth look great now and she eats without avoiding using any of her teeth. I feel like Prytania Vet was just using my lack of knowledge and my love for my cats to deceive me into giving them money for an unnecessary procedure. I expect more from my doctors, and my cats doctors. I will not be taking either of my cats to them again.",2012-06-26 19:47:08

The menu rotates a lot so some of the items might not be there but just from what I tasted, I'm confident your meal will taste just as good as mine, regardless of what you get. It's a hefty price but if you're waiting three months for your reservation, it's definitely worth it (we lucked out and made ours two weeks in advance). 

This is my second time coming here and the food was amazing, but what really blew me away this time was the service. All the servers were incredibly friendly and helpful. I went for my birthday and we didn't actually inform them about it until two hours before the reservation, but they were still able to print out custom menus for us wishing me a happy birthday! It's a small gesture, but given the little warning I was very impressed. 

...
FOOD

We went with the chef's tasting menu and although it rotates a lot, I was impressed with everything I ordered both times I went. We ordered the Turkish hummus, Fried Cauliflower, Spring Bean Mashwe, Carrot Schnitzel, and Haloumi Cheese as small plates. For the Al Ha'esh (Grilled Meat over Coals), we went with the Chicken Shishlik and Hanger Steak. For the dessert, we got the Chocolate Kanafi with Mint Ice Cream and the Malabi Custard with blood orange.

Mezze+ (Small Plate): First off, the vegetable selection for the Salatim was delicious. I didn't like a lot of the vegetable choices before coming to Zahav, for example beets, but I loved what the restaurant did with this selection. The hummus and laffa were of course amazing and the way it comes out so hot amplifies the taste many times over. The Cauliflower and Carrot small plates were lightly fried and breaded and the accompanying sauces (lemon mint and sour cream-like sauces, respectively) really introduced new flavors to your palette. Those were the two winners for me. The Spring Beans and Cheese dishes were good but I probably wouldn't order it again, if only because other dishes stood out more. Although I didn't quite realize what a good pairing fried cheese, strawberry and rhubarb made. 

Al Ha'esh (Grilled meat over Coals): The Chicken and Steak were unlike anything I have ever tasted. I didn't know it was possible to have so much flavor in bite sized pieces but Zahav made it happen. The meat comes in an individual skewer with roughly six bite sized pieces. The Steak was amazing by itself and ranks near the top among any of the other places I've had steak. The Chicken was also delicious but what stood out especially was how the sauce complemented it so well. It tasted a lot like a peanut sauce common in Asian dishes and I loved it. I definitely appreciate the quality over quantity aspect here because after all the small plates and salatim/hummus, I was getting quite full. 

Dessert: After the meat skewers, I didn't think the meal could get any better, but somehow the dessert made it happen - perfect end to a delicious meal. The mint ice cream tasted extremely natural and you could tell it was made with real mint. The pairing with the chocolate kanafi was incredible. Aside from the flavor, the crunch from the kanafi, the melting chocolate, and the cold ice cream really brought the plate together. The blood orange custard was amazing - it was as sweet and creamy as it was delicate. None of these desserts are overwhelmingly sweet but do just enough to satisfy that sweet craving after every meal, which I love.",2019-04-24 01:40:36

I was desperate for a cut and color and this location was the only place with an opening on a Friday afternoon.   I travel for a living and was not very familiar with the area but it seemed decent.  

I called to ask the prices and she stated,  ""I don't usually give my prices over the phone"".   First red flag.   Should have just called the owner at that point and let it go - but again... desperate times.   So I called allllllll the other salons in the area - including other super cuts and none within a 60 mile radius of my hotel had availability - but every damn one gave me a price quote.   

I get there and am in the chair and after a few minutes of chat - I say,  ""What is this gonna cost me ?"".  She looks me in the mirror and says, ""I dunno.  We will have to see."".    Should have gotten up and left - but again - desperate.   

So I press and say, ""didn't you say color was on sale this month ?"".    Her, ""yeah"".    I said,  ""well can you ball park it so I don't die at the cash register ? "". She said, ""well, it just depends..."".   I should have left.   I should have asked what did it depend on ... which ever bill she needed to pay that day or how much she could milk out of me   She knew I was desperate.   

It takes us a few minutes to decide on a color because I really didn't like the choices.  I could tell she was put out and was getting an attitude so I narrowed it to two and told her I would trust her ""professional"" opinion to make the final choice -based on my natural hair color and skin tone.   I said,  ""Use one of these two - but don't tell which i you choose , Surprise me"".   

So she slops the color on and has me sit in the shampoo chair to wait it out.   Ya know,  the uncomfortable chair that you lean back in to wash your hair and doesn't support your back when you sit up.   All I could think was,  ""What in the hell?  does this chick want me to lay my head in the shampoo bowl for the wait ??"".  

In the interim,  I notice the blonde.   WTF.   I am a brunette with red roots.   I am a deep ginger.  Come from long line of gingers.   Not a blonde strand of hair on either side of the family.   I text my BFF because I am now concerned.   

So a guy comes in and she cuts his hair while I an awkwardly sitting in the  shampoo chair with a plastic bag in my head.  She goes over his head with the clippers.  Done in ten mins.  She comes to back and starts taking my hair down.   Is she kidding ?    So she had me down, rinsed, conditioned and almost back to the chair before the timer ever went off.  All I could think was whatever the hell kind of shit show thus turns into - it would at least not last.   

We go to the styling chair and she proceeds to ""style"" my hair.   Then she remembers I want a cut.  She does EXACTLY four snips with the sheers and says, ""you know what. I ain't even gonna cut this til after we style it because this is too cute "".    so she uses this huge round brush and dries my hair.  I have very fine hair and thankfully she used no product so it didn't even hold til I could get to the car and take a picture - but it was a HUGE bob with like mickey mouse ears on the sides of my head.  Not even the top.   Whatever.  I looked in the mirror and nearly died.  At this point,  I was just ready to go.   She said this color is beautiful.  ""Don't you like it.   I ain't even gonna lie.  I put some BLONDE  in it.  I told myself I was gonna fix you ""    

Well, hell no.  I hate the color.  But what do I say ?  So I smile and nod and am just trying to exit.    

We go to the cash register and she does some ""mental math"" and comes up with $89.   I nearly pooped in the floor and I guess it was evident when I repeated $89 back to her with my incredulous tone.   She  THEN says, "" oh but I have taken the discount "".   and somehow comes up with $78.   I paid it and got the hell out of there.  

Now, today,  I am back home in Memphis.  Had to get a box color to fix this pile of poop and waiting on Super Cuts or some similar here to open so I can pay for a second hair cut in 48 hours before I start my new assignment tomorrow.   

Yep - my fault for not throwing a complete fit and walking out - I accept that part.  

She asked me to leave a review.  Well, here it is.  Never patronize anyone that won't t ell you prices up front.   That is COMPLETELY suspect and unprofessional.    Never patronize a business where the music is louder than the conversation in the room.   Never patronize a business where the person providing service breaks out in song to sing along with obnoxiously loud music mid sentence.    It was just a hot damn mess from the minute I walked in but again,  I was desperate.    

She was pleasant.  I understand she is trying to make a living as evidenced by having her children there at work with her - been there and had to do that - but I completely got rooked.   Saddens me to have to pay double to fix this crap and get a second haircut",2020-09-27 17:54:03

I had a dog who was diagnosed with a mast cell tumor...an aggressive form of Cancer.  Although this is not something they typically treat, Dr. Bonnville was willing and committed to helping my dog and me.   Most vets would have just said ""we don't treat this"" and referred me to the oncologist. Knowing I was on a limited budget, he took it upon himself to consult by phone with a veterinary oncologist and was able to treat my dog while saving me a huge amount of money. 
Once we found the medication that worked, a medication which had to be specially ordered,  he made sure to always keep it in stock for us. 
Dr. Bonnville gave my dog 2 and a half additional QUALITY years that he would not have had otherwise, because of his kindness and compassion for his patients.
When it came time to say goodbye to Albert, Dr. Bonnville was off for the day, but was willing to come in that afternoon knowing that I wanted him to be the one to handle it. I didn't want to wait once I made the decision, so Dr. Martinez, who was on that day, took us immediately and was so caring and compassionate I don't know what I would've done without him. Having never met me or Albert before, he made it clear to me that he cared and that he was going to take the time needed to make this as easy as he could for both Albert and me. 
When I asked, not for the first time, if I was doing the right thing, he stopped everything and pulled open Albert's file and went through it.  Without influencing me by saying what I should do, he went over the prognosis again so that I could come to the conclusion myself that this was the best thing for Albert. He wasn't worried that people were waiting for him, nor was he thinking about his next appointment.  He was amazing!
I can never think both of them enough, and I will never go to another veterinary clinic. I drive 45 minutes from Saint Pete to get my animals the best care around!
One more note about this hospital...They never do unnecessary procedures or prescribe anything that's not needed. There have actually been times when I've asked if I needed certain tests or X-rays for my dogs and was told It wasn't necessary because it wouldn't change the treatment plan.
I can't say enough about Keene veterinary Hospital and the doctors there. You can never go wrong if you choose them!

I arrived for a consult and brought my records from the past two years of eye exams that included dilation therefore I did not need to be dilated at the consult which saved ALOT of time. They moved right along to the eye measurements and exams which were all touch less meaning all you do is look into different lenses and different lights to determine how well you can see. Nothing uncomfortable. Then they go over all the options and instructions in detail and answer any questions you might have. It helps to come prepared with questions as there can be a lot of information. They took the time and answered everything. Then if you scheduled ahead of time to have the surgery the same day you wait for the surgery. Other option is to come back another day for surgery.  Getting ready for surgery they place a hair net over your hair and you sit in a room where Dr Shah comes to take one last look at your eyes and reviews your surgery and walks with you to the laser room. You lay down on a comfortable table that will move during the procedure to each laser that is used. They put numbing drops on your eyes then the doctor guides you to look straight ahead and the procedure took less than 10 minutes. There was pressure on your eye and a small amount of weird feelings on your eyes but honestly no pain. Breathe and lay calmly and before you know it it's over. My consult was at 11am and I was done and out of there at 1pm. 

The first 4 hours after were ""miserable"" as the doctor openly and honestly stated. Feels like sand is stuck in your eyes and they water profusely. That is your body adjusting to the surgery. Don't rub your eyes!!! Take something to help you sleep when you get in the car and sleep it off. When you wake up to do the first set of eye drops that discomfort is gone. My vision was slightly cloudy but I could see as well as when I had my glasses on. It's amazing. Keep up with your drops and don't rub your eyes. Wear the sunglasses they provided. By 8am the next morning my vision was perfect. Had my post op checkup and went from 20/50 to 20/15. No discomfort no irritation. So happy with having this done here. 
Also, for all the germaphobes this place is spotless. They thoroughly clean every single thing before and after use. I like that I could see them cleaning to know everything is safe for me. I highly recommend getting LASIK and getting it at this office.

So let me first start off by saying that we found this hotel back in April 2021 and fell in love with it so much that we stayed a total of 3 times since mid April . This last trip we had a family emergency that prompted us to stay 4 nights everything was fine up until after we checked out. We always bring our Roku with us because we stayed four nights versus 2 nights we had a lot more stuff to pack and was sorta rushing to meet the check out time of 11am needless to say we got down to checkout around 11ish check out stopped at the local Circle K and jumped on the I-10 heading home an hour into our trip i realized i forgot our Roku and remote i called Home2 Suites immediately and spoke to ""Sol"" she assured me not to worry that she was going to contact the housekeeping supervisor and get back to me needless to say i did not hear back from her i decided to call at 3:30pm and spoke to ""Sandra"" i explained to her what happened and how i was waiting for a call back Sandra apologized and asked me to hold on which i did she came back to the line and informed me that she sent someone upto the room to see if it was there and asked me to hold again i said ok then Sandra came back on the line and said she sent a second person up and they should be getting back to her shortly i said ok meanwhile while i was waiting i truly was not prepared for what i was about to hear next, Sandra came back on the phone and said both employees came back and said that there was not Roku or remote . I was truly shocked I asked her was the room cleaned and she said yes then i proceeded to tell her that ok so that means whoever cleaned the room and made the bed literally took the Roku and the Remote the remote was on the bed that was closest to the sofa.. Sandra proceeded to say she was sorry but there was no Roku and i proceeded to tell her that they needed to talk to the person who cleaned the room i told her that as we where leaving there was a cleaning cart and the far end of the hallway she needed to talk to that person she then proceeded to say she did and basically this employee was a good employee and he wouldn't do anything like that.. I proceeded to tell her i don't care what she thought at the end of the day you have employees there that are not honest and that steal and that i would be filing a police report because to me it's no longer about the Roku and Remoter but now it's an ethical concern . I also explained to her that we paid over $650.00 to stay at there facility this trip and for it to end in this manner is very disheartening. I will be also placing this review on Yelp and social media because i want people to be aware..We came to Tucson so that we could be present for a close family member who had been diagnosed with stage 4 colon/liver cancer and had to have emergency surgery and then having to end the trip with this issue is just horrible. here it is 11:40 am the day after and i have yet to hear from the General Mgr. Mr Mauro Trejo as Sandra told me she was sending him an email at that very moment we were talking so clearly Mr. Mauro Trejo does not care. so on to my next review with a follow up with Corporate!!",2021-05-27 19:00:51

I had been to Fuel for coffee when we first moved here, but since replacing the coffee in my diet with nausea-inducing amounts of green tea, I hadn't been there in at least a year. And after a recent ""re-discovering Fuel"" visit, I almost rue the day I ended my unintentional boycott. Almost.

Here's the rub: Fuel now serves brunch. And not just any breakfast....pretty delicious large plates of brunch. Thus, in a hangover-induced stupor, all we have to do is roll out of bed, partially pajama'd, and shuffle down the street. And until other people find out about the tiny enclave of deliciousness, this bittersweet discovery is available to us, line-free.

But wait, the plot thickens. I come to find out via Lagniappe that the man slinging eggs at Fuel, James Leeming, was trained in the kitchens of the New Orleans Kitchen Mafia (aka the Brennan's empire), but saw opening the kitchen at Fuel as an opportunity to quit working nights in order to spend more time with his son. Go fig.

My first meal post-sabbatical was the malted waffle with candied pecans and sausage. We all know that dipping your sausage in syrup is an exquisite if frowned upon pleasure, but few people have the gall to actually serve them together in a stack. Ergo, well done, Mr. Leeming. Beyond that, he does a version of eggs benedict with pork debris and jalapeno cornbread that is sufficiently decadent and a few different versions of eggs and two, one including sausage gravy.

On our last visit, we branched out into lunch with the Cuban sandwich and the crab cake salad. While I like their breakfast, I can now say that I LOVE their lunch. Even though the Cuban was served on what appeared to be bunny bread, it was perfectly grilled and I appreciate that it wasn't pants-unbuttoning huge. The crab cake salad was an exciting blend of flavors and textures. The spinach was perfectly dressed and I appreciated the thinly sliced apples and sautéed onions hidden under the leaves. I was surprised to find the mango and avocado both ripe and the crab cake not over-fried.  Bravo!

The good: the atmosphere! Wow, it's amazing. The lobby and corridor gives you a 1930's speakeasy, gatsby feel. It's gorgeous and it's pretty amazing that most of the interior hasn't been touch since it's grand opening in the 30s. The rooms were amazing, too. VERY modern, very sleek, very minimal - but Oh so very comfortable. I have never felt more at home in a hotel before.  It's also a 5 minute walk to broadway and a 10 minute walk to Bridgestone, so it was in a wonderful location 

The bad: I was asked to place a credit card on file upon check in, just in case for incidentals. That's fine, but the staff failed to mentioned there'd be a $100 hold on my credit card. When I noticed $100 was missing from my bank account, I called the hotel and a front desk agent said it'd be placed back in my account immediately after checkout. Today, I checked out and asked about the hold being released - none of the staff knew what I was even talking about. Told me it was ""unusual"" that this happened, because it ""shouldn't have"" and that I need to y'all to accounting. They transferred me, but it went to a voicemail. I called back, asked for a manager, and she connected me to a mail box that WAS FULL. At that point, I was incredibly frustrated and called FOR A THIRD TIME to talk to a manager on duty, like I asked. Somehow, this tome, there was a manager right next to the staff that I could talk to. She was less than helpful. Told me I may or may not get the $100 back. Great. As mentioned, I'm a college kid and need every penny. I finally just disputed the $100 charge with my bank and got it back. 
Also, please note there is no self parking. You can pay the $40 overnight valet though. 

Overall, the experience here was incredible. It was amazing and I'd love to stay here again. But the staff needs to be retrained to warn about holds, if this is what actually happened. Or the staff (from the front desk agent to the managers) need to try to help, instead of leaving their Guest feeling like their issues were pushed aside.",2018-03-19 22:56:05

The communication from them is terrible, they have no consideration for customers time and because if this their customer service is terrible. This was my 3rd experience with them and will never use them again. The first time I used them a few years ago the got whatever sealant the used around the window all over my truck. I had to clean it off so it did not damage or harm my paint. Second time the filled ina chip/crack. It looked terrible, wasn't clear and could clearly see where this was repair was done. This time it goes to a whole new level as described below. Strongly recommend not to use them for anything!

My car windshield had a chip and several big cracks from a rock hitting it. Went through my insurance company and set a mobile appoint with Safelite for two days later on a Friday for a window of 8am-12pm. On Friday I got a call from the technician letting me know he would be there between 10am-12pm and would contact me when he was on his way. 11:35 I get a knock on my door and he is here. As he looks at the car realizes that the insurance company put in the wrong model of the vehicle. Not their fault or mine mistakes happen. He tells me he is going to call his office and see if they have the correct part. When he calls the person he is trying to reach is out of the office at the moment but will be back shortly and be able to let him know. He says he will call me as soon as he hears from the person in the office to verify if they have the part. If not he will have to reschedule for Monday.. if they do, he can't guarantee if he can make it back but he will also call to let me know that. I dont like it but I get it. Not their fault because of the wrong model number given by insurance company. 

This is where it goes wrong with Safelite. So it gets around 3pm same day and I have had no call whatsoever. So I call the number and I get their service number. I explain everything to them and they said they will call the office to find out what the status is. She comes back and says she talked to the office manager and they are going to have the technician call me. I wait and no call! I then try just before 5pm, go through there process to talk to someone and because it took a few minutes to do this, the time is now 5pm and the recording tells me to call back between the hours of 8am-5pm Monday through Friday. Now I go online to their website for the first time and reschedule. I reachedule for a 11am on that Monday at their office and not mobile service. So when Monday comes I call again at 8:10am to make sure they have the right car model window and get their call service again. When I explain to them  what happened, they immediately tell me they can't change it and I have to go through my insurance company. They call with me on the line and then leave me with them to get it changed. Then I find out Safelite no longer has availability for me because they are all booked up for that day. Even though I had an appointment for 11am they have no availability but not because they do not have the part. 

The originally issue that caused the problem was not their fault but how they handles it after is. If they woyld have just told me that I have to fix this with my isurance company to get the correct model number part the two times I talked to them, they would have never got this review!",2020-06-22 13:11:21
7_TDc1hQJczcDoF7LPiDuA,uDFNUZcsK4HZbV4tOjjU1w,VpJzlz3bKOJtiI1rb9kTpw,4.0,6,2,6,"I absolutely LOVE Indian food, so I was excited when the Yelp International Supper Club announced Saffron as our next destination.  I'd been here a few other times and was looking forward to another visit.

Saffron's food leans towards the North Indian food category with more creamy and mild spices as compared to much spicier South Indian variations.  However, you still might find this food to have a little sting if you're not a big spice eater. You can order different spice levels here, but I found the ""medium"" to be rather mild for my taste.  I've enjoyed most everything I've tried at Saffron, but can't say this is the best in St. Louis.  It's really hard to rate Indian restaurants and it depends on if you are rating the buffet or ordering off the menu.  I give Saffron somewhere around good 3.5 to 4 stars based on both.

I've tried a few appetizers here including the hariyali chicken appetizer for $8.50, which is also available as a main course.  Described as being marinated in yogurt, cilantro and mint, it came out nice and juicy on a bed of grilled onions and peppers.  It was absolutely delicious, but missing the tandoori oven effect that was described on the menu.  It's a good option if you are looking for meat that's not smothered in a curry sauce.  The meat and veggie samosas were both excellent here.  These deep fried stuffed pastries are like samosas on steroids they are so huge! They come with a trio of delicious sauces- tamarind, tomato chutney and cilantro-mint, which all go well with the samosas.

I couldn't pass up the channa masala which is one of my all time favorite Indian dishes.  This veggie classic is made with chickpeas and cooked in a nice spicy tomato sauce and Saffron's version for $9.95 didn't disappoint.  It's good served over rice, but you can also just scoop it up with one of the many different bread choices.

The chicken korma for $12.95 is also good here.  It's a creamy dish with chunks of boneless chicken breast cooked in a yogurt and puréed cashew sauce.  If you are new to Indian food, this is a good dish to try.  It is usually served mild, but you are given a choice of spice level here at Saffron.  

Chicken malai tikka ($8.50 or $14.95)is usually one of my favorite dishes, but it was a bit disappointing here at saffron.  What I was served tasted good, but it just didn't taste like the chicken malai that I'm used to having.  The yogurt, spice and cheese marinade should have had a thicker coating on the chicken in my opinion. 

Overall, I'd say Saffron has consistently good Indian food.  I'd recommend it to try, but would also suggest exploring some of the other restaurants in the metropolitan area.  I'm sure I'll be back on occasion to sample more of the menu items.",2013-02-14 17:09:20

I stumbled across it one day while wandering around the city. I was hungry so I decided to walk in and the smells set my stomach to rumbling. The décor is simple. A very low key place to eat. My favorite item on the menu is their Black Eyed Pea fritter called Akara. The staff swears it is made with black eyed peas but the inside is white as clean snow and I do not taste a single black eye pea in the mix. That being said, it is, however simply delicious! Tender and soft and not hard or crunchy like something that has been over fried. It is the size of a hush puppy but quintessentially better! I thought perhaps it was a fluke... like maybe I arrived on a good day and the stars aligned up just right so I went back a second time with friends and it was JUST as good as the first time.  I ordered their Sisay Singho which is baked chicken leg and thigh, sautéed spinach, sweet plantains, and coconut rice. The portions were so large I had enough left over for dinner the next day.

I went a third time with co-workers. We ordered Akara again and Doh Doh, which is fried ripe plantains as appetizers. Ndole, which is beef, spinach, ground fresh peanuts in ginger and garlic sauce served with fried ripe plantains and coconut rice, and Cope ni Cone, which is boneless chicken, broccoli, ginger, and garlic sauce served over rice and the Sisay Singho again. Everyone was delighted with their order and what can I say, we were not disappointed. I thought I took pictures but think I deleted them off my phone. Sorry... next time! 

Now, not everything is perfect! I went back alone a third time and ordered their Sorso Nessing, which is lentil soup and Sorso Wolengho Ni Mano, which is red beans and beef sausage slices served with rice. The first three bites of the lentil soup was so delicious, I shed a tear of happiness. THEN, the spicy hit me head on! At first I just started having violent hiccups associated with the hotness. I attempted to eat two more bites of just the lentils and the hiccups became so intense, it felt like my diaphragm was trying to launch my stomach out of my body. I could not take another bite if I wanted to keep my dignity intact for fear of hurling. How can something taste so heavenly and so spicy at the same time? If you love spicy, this is the soup for you! As far as the red beans and beef sausage, I was disappointed. The red beans and rice were tasty, but not memorable. And the sliced beef sausage tasted like a plain hot dog. Nothing to write home about.",2019-06-17 09:54:06

I recently joined Yelp and I  wanted to share a memory from years ago which led me to being a customer of Walden's Coffee shop.  One very cold February morning approximately around 3am I was working graveyard patrol downtown.  I saw on my mobile data terminal an intrusion alarm for Walden's at Mayberry and Mccarran which had just popped up on our pending calls screen.  Though my beat is the Silver Legacy, Circus Circus, and Eldorado Casinos downtown and I wasn't busy I figured I'd head out to Walden's because we don't get alarms from that business.  I bet it was going to be a good burglary.

As I arrived in the area I creeped up to the business hiding in the darkness.  As I came around to the West door I could see it had been forced open.  While checking to see if the suspect was still on scene I walked around Walden's towards Mayberry.  There I saw a male riding a bicycle without any lamps illuminated on his bicycle.  Once this male on the bicycle saw me and I told him to stop he fled from me Westbound down Mayberry.  I quickly jumped in my Hemi and the chase was on.  As the rider approached EdgeWater Parkway he turned right leading me down to the Truckee River Path.  While pursuing this bicyclist at 20mph and him being two feet off my front bumper I know we were approaching a tight squeeze as I wasn't sure I could get my car onto the River path at Edge Water and River Haven Dr.  Needless to say I did fit and the chase continued onto the River path Eastbound.  At this point I was smelling blood and then yards 20 yards down the path the rider did an amazing thing...he without hesitation rode the bicycle into the River,  can you believe he went head first into the Truckee River.  As I exited my patrol car I saw him floating down the river out of sight.  With help from Reno Fire kayak squad,Raven helicopter, and graveyard patrol we engaged in hours of intense search for this suspect.

The suspect was never located.  I'll never forget pulling his bicycle out of the River and putting it on the River path where minutes later the dripping water was freezing on the asphalt.

After giving up the search I made my way back to Walden's were I met Michael.  He had already opened up the kitchen and he kindly asked me if I wanted a breakfast burrito.  At this point I had never been a patron of Walden's.  Michael asked me what I wanted in it.  I remember being taken by surprise by his kindness and offer, I responded by saying everything you got!  I was freezing.  Not only had his business been victimized, I had lost the suspect who I thought was responsible.  Needless to say I was pissed this guy had eluded me.  Still to this day every time I go to Walden's I think about this incident.  

Back to my breakfast today! I was getting my wifey's car washed at Mr Magic so I headed into Walden's on Wells Ave.  What a great spot.  I ordered the linguica and eggs.  It was amazing, just like that first breakfast burrito, and Michael was even working at Wells Ave today.  Thanks again Michael.  Walden's is the BEST coffee shop in Reno. 

Since that first breakfast burrito I've tried to come to the different Locations Walden's has a couple times a month.  It's still my favorite breakfast burrito and I continue to find new things I love.",2019-09-21 17:20:59

They have a pretty consistent level of customer service regardless of how busy it is which is kind of nice. I always get a greeting and nine times out of ten someone approaches me right away to offer assistance in locating things or to let me know about a sale. The only downside in the customer service here is if you happen to come in on a rare occasion the store is not busy like in the morning for instance you can sometimes be approached 3-4 times which can get overwhelming.

The store layout regardless of what location you are at is usually pretty similar which is great if your looking to get in and out quickly. They also do a great job of keeping stock levels here nice and full. I have noticed other stores like Kingsway and Londonderry don't really keep up with putting out the small travel sized items and I was wondering if Bath and Body Works was trying to get away from that and more into pushing the more expensive full sized products but I have never really felt that when visiting WEM.

While I am on the topic of price I have to say....and this goes for all locations not just WEM....why is hardly anything here ever priced!!?? It seems like the days of stickers on the bottles are long gone and instead they put up these tiny plastic signs on the product display tables listing prices of types and sizes of products but even then they don't put these signs on every table. Needless to say I usually get my exercise when visiting a Bath and Body Works whilst walking about trying to locate prices.

The main reason I stick to Londonderry and don't make special trips to WEM to get my  fix is the volume of customers that shop in this store. Like I mentioned earlier in the review there are very few times they aren't busy and if your in during a sale your looking at a long lineup at the till.

If your from the west side or are a frequent WEM shopper then you really can't get away with not stopping in here. There are so many great sales that it's easy to load up on lots of great gifts for your best girlfriends and still have cash left over to treat yourself. If you are closer to another location however save yourself the headache that sometimes comes from having to deal with congestion and long line ups and stick with a smaller store. Either way you can never go wrong with Bath and Body Works!",2014-11-21 06:19:50

Damn good service!  Everything we wanted was provided, promptly and with a smile.  Every question was answered.  Every thing that should have happened, happened.

Damn good cocktails!  I started with something along the lines of a blackberry bourbon sidecar and finished with their version of an old fashioned.  Both were perfect and deliciously strong.

Damn nice bread basket!  I like a good bread service.  I enjoy some variety and they delivered in spades.  My favorite of the varieties I tasted has to be their pumpernickel.  I rarely eat that stuff for a reason - it can be pretty dry and lacking in flavor.  Suffice to say their version was the exact opposite.  Full of flavor, slightly chewy and delicious.  Also, they sprinkle their butter patties with sea salt.  Who doesn't love that?

Damn good shrimp appetizer.  Ginormous shrimp in a delectable sauce that just begged to be mopped up with the saturated bread (similar to a focaccia) that was plated under the shrimp.  Big thanks to Steven B for sharing those with the table!

Damn fine prime rib!  I would not say that I'm a connoisseur but I do enjoy a good plate of prime rib and I know a bad plate of prime rib as well...looking at you, US Army formal banquet food (I kid you not, dear reader: once we had a waiter come around after setting down the plates and offer everyone extra fat).  I digress.  This was a really, really good prime rib.  They must have applied the crusting material with a trowel because it was thick enough that it endured all the way to the table and the savory flavors it brought to the party made those outside bites just THAT much better.  The beef was cooked perfectly medium rare as I ordered.  Juicy, tender and perfect.

Less than mind-blowing was the clam chowder but still perfectly serviceable.  There were side dishes as well but they faded into the background as I concentrated on finishing my prime rib and eating the bone marrow that came on the side.   

I was pretty well smoked after consuming all of the above but somehow got talked into participating in dessert.  They served us a warm apple galette with vanilla ice cream on top.  I hate to say this but I think my enjoyment of the dessert was hampered by how full I was before it arrived.

Damn fine evening!  Thanks again to Steven B for organizing and to Capital Grill for their $45 3-course Sunday dinner.  Shout-out to Stephen W. and Mel A. for attending as well.  I'll gladly dine with you again!",2018-10-25 01:13:29
_plMS78vDzgJedPzwExlmQ,8eC6EOsLTmfVk_35t3ZQqg,WBbHaxP600hEN02-UDtHmA,4.0,2,0,1,"I was definitely stoked to see a Groupon available for Poppy Kitchen because it had been on my list of places to try since we found out it was opening at the Gio Taco Elite event. You can't really beat $50 for an appetizer, two glasses of wine, two entrees and dessert, especially at a restaurant at the Westin. We really enjoyed the view from the restaurant and want to check out the patio next time. If we didn't already have wine included with the groupon we definitely would have taken advantage of their half price wines on Sunday deal.

To start we tried the steak tartar but it was really hard to decide on one ""snack"". We definitely enjoyed it but next time I think we'll try something else. After we finished the tartar and ordered our entrees we were quickly brought out what we assumed were our plates but as soon as we looked at them and realized they weren't, the person who dropped them off was gone. We flagged down our waiter and told him we didn't order them so he took them away. Not a big deal, mistakes happen... but then I saw him take the food and serve it to who it was intended for. I don't know much about regulations in the food industry but I don't think it was right to serve food that had already been given to someone else. We obviously hadn't, but they would have had no idea if we had touched it before they took it back. At least we saw our entrees come directly from the kitchen. I had the duck which was really tasty. The skin wasn't as crispy as it could have been but still good. The fried rice was really unique. I asked the waiter what kind of rice they used in it and all he could remember is ""volcanic.. something"" so I'm not sure what they use in it but I liked it. Not your traditional ""fried"" rice but overall had good flavor. I did have to eat around some large chunks of fat from the duck confit though. Fiance ordered the seafood gumbo and although it wasn't much to look at, he devoured his whole plate. It had a nice spice to it, lots of different proteins and the okra on top was a nice touch. As far as plating goes, it might be nice to put the rice on top instead of underneath. The only disappointment with the gumbo was when my fiance found some cartridge/bone in a spoonful. Not very appetizing.

The highlight of the night was the made to order carrot cake. It was served piping hot in a small cast iron skillet and topped with a delicious cream cheese ice cream. Next time we won't be sharing one because we were literally fighting over bites! Loved everything about it. Next time I might just order three - one for my app, entree and dessert.

Overall, Poppy Kitchen was good but I wasn't blown away due to a few missteps. I'd like to make it our there again to try a few more dishes, sit on the patio and have that delicious carrot cake again. I also believe they recently started a Saturday brunch - I'd like to see the menu for that and possibly check it out.",2014-03-31 19:20:53
pPlZIrZ5uz4XZXJNiehKbg,mkkv_XW4x1502qJeFEbj0g,RPEMUwN_CDRRToQ_7hxsvA,2.0,3,0,0,"I ate here last night with the Mr.. We met a few of our friends up at the bar who had been dining for an hour previous. We were going to catch them for a cocktail before they had to leave for an event, and we were also going to eat dinner at the bar.

The reason for the poor rating? Service. We sat at the bar, and the bar service was terrible. It seemed as if we were a big inconvenience, and they were rushing to get us out. I've worked in restaurants before as a bartender, and I know it's not easy, but the bar was near-empty, as was the restaurant. I asked one of the bartenders if it was shift-change, or if something was happening, and he said no, that it was just the end of Happy Hour.

After about 5 minutes of waiting, we were greeted and asked what we wanted. We responded that we'd like to eat dinner. They brought us plates and dinner menus. When I asked if I could have something to drink, the bartender responded with, ""Ok, what do you want?"" I asked for a cocktail menu, which I was provided. We ordered our drinks. Eventually, they came back to take our order, and I mentioned that we would be ordering a few small plates as appetizers, and one entree afterward to share, and possibly dessert. We were prepared to walk into this place and spend money to have a good time... but that didn't work out. 

We got our appetizers-- the duck poppers and grilled oysters as well as a bowl of the gazpacho. The food was wonderful and fresh. As we were sitting, the bartender was wiping the counter down, and wiping directly next to us while we are eating, bussing the butter dish when we still have bread, and basically making us feel as if we are in the way. By this time, I'm out of wine, and the Mr. is out of beer. The other bartender asks us if we'd like some refills. We say yes, and he pours the Mr.'s beer, and walks away. I never get my wine. The first bartender swings back by and picks up the plates. 

After about 15 minutes, they return, and ask if we'd like anything else. At this point, I'm put off, and decide its probably not the best thing to stay here, as I feel like an inconvenience. We say we were thinking about it, but we'll most likely skip on out. The girl decides to ask me if I wanted any more wine, and I say that no, we're fine. We get our check, pay out, and tip the regular 20% (because I'm an ex bartender and server, and I can't stomach cutting the tip. I'll just choose not go back.) 

As we're leaving the restaurant, we pass by the host stand to see if there's anyone there that we might talk to about our experience. There are two male servers behind the host stand doing what looks to be flirting with the hostess. Absolutely no one even so much as acknowledges us on the way out. 

All in all, the food was nice, and I'd like to have experienced more of it, if the service had not impaired the experience so much and driven us away. Had it not been for the food, I would have given this place one star, and that for the decor. 

This experience leads me to believe that the BRG is over-extending itself, and not paying close attention to detail. I sincerely hope they fix the service problem, and maybe they were just having a bad day, but it didn't seem as if anyone was personally invested in the service.",2012-06-22 14:26:52
Q5vCZdo1cuxgpZ4fNkspPg,5J9N4ol0ho5_oDB7x4JrKg,G0Fhi9lh1sSZSSPuXpe6Ug,3.0,1,0,1,"Returned for a Rose wine pairing dinner. We have been here before for the VIP and soft openings. 

5 courses paired with wines from around the world. Melon carpaccio, lobster bisque, pork loin, salmon and dessert. We came with another couple and were seated at a table of 10, with assigned places. We usually like to sit across from each other but could not do that here. We were in a private dining room towards the back of the place. It was a nice set up. We met some very nice new people and enjoyed the company. 

We arrived at 615p promptly for our 630p tasting but a few couples must have forgotten the time as they sauntered in late making those of us who arrived timely a bit frustrated. Service did not begin until 7pm. Not good. Next time we will arrive late. No we won't just kidding.

The wine guy made a nice speech and did the same before each course. He was good. The wines were all rose's and were pretty good but there was not much difference between the 2nd to 4th wines. I liked the second wine with the lobster. We were surprised that the pork preceded the salmon - should have been switched, we all thought. 

The food was good. I thought the pork dish was best. Others thought the lobster was best. There was a lot of food. Portions could have been a tad smaller and the experience would have been just as good. I really liked the beet purée that came with the melon carpaccio and we all liked the charred vegetables which looked like pepper in the presentation of the pork and when chef Tim stopped by we gave him our input. 

Service was lumpy, but servers were pleasant and cheerful. The start was unfortunate. We say if service starts at 630p and 38 out of 44 customers are ready and waiting there is no sense holding off until stragglers arrive. Not respectful of the rest.  Our courses were brought staggered but our table was typically served 6 dishes then 4 later sometime much later. After the third course it improved and it looked like a manager took control. It improved towards the end. The wine flowed freely and there was never an issue when someone wanted another glass. 

It was very loud. Not unexpected for an event like this. Being a fairly new place for the area the place was packed and the bar was crowded. We saw some friends in the regular dining room as we proceeded to the tasting room. We spent a few minutes having a cocktail waiting for our companions. The bartender was very helpful and explained a bit about the tasting.

We say Food 'b', Service ""c"", ambiance 'b"", value 'b+"". The tasting was $59 per person. 

We would return.

C_ygmwMraavtrZahz9SB4g,2mvsDVNtrCR1FYYB9JuEWw,9m6FEbg7mXTRf-H3u8ylmQ,1.0,0,0,0,"Last month my husband, my son and myself stayed at the Hilton St. Louis at the Arch. This was a weekend getaway that I had planned for months, I made the reservations for another hotel originally but cancelled those to stay at this Hilton due to its amenities, closeness to attractions, etc. I did this despite the room rate for this hotel being more than $100 more a night than my originally hotel. We left for our weekend getaway a 4am the morning of check in and arrived at our hotel around 5pm. It was a long day traveling with a 8 month old, add the stress of rush out traffic and the storms that were causing downpours of rain, needless to say we were exhausted and ready to check in and rest in our room. We go up to the desk, give our name, I hand the gentleman our reservation that I had printed out and thought all was well. Then he states, we don't have room under that name. No biggie, I try my maiden name, sometimes that happens. Still no room. This gentleman then turns to go into a room and out comes the ""manager"". He goes on to explain to us that at the beginning of the day they ran the credit card for which I had placed the reservation on and it had been declined. He then goes on to tell me they attempted to call me ""several times and left a voicemail"". Do to the fact that I did not return their call, they were forced to give our room away. And the hotel was full do to a conference and a baseball game. We go on to explain that the credit card was denied because we are from out of state and part of our fraud protection automatically denies out of states purchases. I check my phone, I have ONE missed call, ZERO voicemails and mind you the call was from only an hour before. Like I said before, we arrived at the hotel around 5pm, check in was at 4pm. So, it took only an hour for these people to decide were not showing and to give our room away. After much heated discussion, they offer us a room about 3 miles away but for about the same price. NO. We demand to speak to the managers manager, yet he straight says ""its their day off, I am not calling them."" This goes on for about 15 more minutes then magically another person comes out and ask what the issue is. By the time we are explaining the situation to her, somehow a room magically becomes available. We are given the keys and a voucher for free breakfast and sent on our way. This hotel was nice, it was perfect but do to the treatment we received and the lack of customer service from the first ""manager"" we dealt with and the fact that is superior was around the corner within earshot and let this situation carry on as long as it did, we won't be back.",2016-10-31 19:21:56

1. If you want to waste your time, ok then. Just went in for a state inspection, they said it will be done in 1 1/2 hours. I came back 2 1/2 hours later just to give them enough buffer time. The car did not move in it's place. I waited for another hour, just thinking they might have other cars to work on to. But my car did not move at all. I came to the desk, ask an update. Agent told me, what car do you have? (What a question, considering I am the only asian guy there, they cant even remember my car.) After I said that, he told me, they will work on it right now. I entered 3pm, out by 7pm. Just for an Inspection.

2. Safety Inspection Issues. I waited for hours and what did I get? A failed inspection. I know my car, and I'm no mechanic. But I'm the guy that do my own oil changes, my brake pads, my struts, my spark plugs. I even weld my own muffler and change my alternator. I know at least what ""safe""  means. Before I went to this Pepboys branch (because I have no choice because saturday is my only free time, and they were the only one open in the area), I replaced my tires, replaced my brake pads, changed my oil and put on a new gasket in the straight exhaust pipe. Guess what the state inspection report says:

""Pulls left needs rear struts, right rear leaking, front lower control arm, right front subframe support bracket bent, exhaust leaks need whole exhaust system, front and back rack and pinion leaking, rear bumper cover, engine mount with trans mount, wiper blades, rear drums and shoes, air filter and cabin filter""

I drive my car from NY to South Jersey every week in I-95 highway. I should know if the car pulls left. what do they mean about the front lower control arm? What's the safety issue? Rear bumper cover? I know it's cracked, but it's in place and not going anywhere. What's the safety issue there? Whats the issue in my engine and transmission mount? I just checked it now, all welds are fine, all bushings are fine. Wiper blades, ok if it's old, it's old. Rear drums and shoes. Drums??? I have another  20 year old car (civic) and I never changed my drums. Air and Cabin filter, is this really a safety issue???? and the thing that had me thinking for the past few days is this: Does my car really have a REAR RACK & PINION???  So my 99 Camry LX have a rear steering capability???  I don't know if they're really stupid or what, but it's a sure ripoff just to have your money.

3. As I've said, I know my car. After I went there for an inspection, the car alternator started to malfunction. Now I have to get a new one. I just bought and installed a new one a year ago. I don't know what they did, but I've been reading previous reviews about this shop, and they have histories of messing up working automobiles. BIGTIME. I just hope there's nothing else that they messed up. 

4. I got a 4 in the Tire Tread Depth score. How  is that??? I just bought new tires less than a year ago!


So all these I experienced in this Pepboys Branch at Broad St. Staff are very unfriendly. No greetings, no ""what can we do for you today?"" or whatsoever. So for your reference, I will post their names here on this review. Here's what's written in the Official Receipt of the PA State Inspection:

AF0yCc04D724gKLE-ZlIyQ,KVehpTNCERwMGAx-h9MR-A,rjFGFcTduZ5wh-5pl1IbCg,2.0,15,2,3,"TL;DR: High cost. The big white passenger van wasn't ideal. Everywhere we went, we joined up with other tour groups, so our small group size wasn't really an advantage. The plantation tours were quite crowded.

Booking and Pre-Tour Expectation Setting:
The Tours by Isabelle website was clear and easy to understand, and we selected the Grand Tour, including two plantation tours, lunch on the plantation, and a swamp boat ride. We booked our tour a few weeks in advance through Viator. We received good and responsive email communication confirming our pick-up location and time.

Our driver Billy (Who Dat!) was playful and knowledgeable. He did a superb job of setting expectations for the day, and telling us about ""his city"". He was able to answer all our questions about New Orleans history, as well as current events, and recommendations for things to see and places to eat while we were in town. This two-star review is NOT a reflection on Billy (nor the fact that the drive-through daiquiri shop is closed on Mondays). 

We were the last stop to get picked up (and dropped off) because we weren't in the French Quarter. This turned out to be less than ideal. Tours by Isabelle uses big white passenger vans, and only the far-back bench and the front seat next to the driver were available. We put grandpa up front and the four of us all climbed and squeezed into the back. It wasn't easy getting back there, you have to hold the seat belts out of the way and squeeze past the first two rows. Also, the highways of New Orleans are bumpy, and the van's suspension was not up to the task. Sitting right over the rear wheels meant we felt every bump-acutely. We also couldn't talk to Grandpa way up in front. Further, because people are creatures of habit, we were relegated to the very back seat for the entire day. I suppose I could have asked somebody to trade, but I wouldn't have wished that ride on somebody else, it was not comfortable.

We enjoyed the plantation tours. Plantation Laura has a more historically interesting script. Oak Alley is gorgeous. The lunch at Oak Alley was sublime. A huge thank-you to our waitress Britney, she charmed our 3yo daughter and took sublime care of us, making sure everything was just perfect. (Thanks, Britney! I hope your wedding was perfect!) After lunch, we were ushered through the tour, and then rushed back to the van. We didn't have any time to stop and visit the slave quarters or the rest of the property. We sadly didn't get to walk down the oak alley in the front of the house, we just looked at it from the 2nd floor balcony. In the morning, we'd had over a half-hour waiting in the gift shop and on the porch at Laura plantation and that time would have been much better spent wandering Oak Alley. Also, for all three tours, our group was joined up with another group (or two!) from other vans, so the small group size wasn't really an advantage. The two plantation tours were *packed* with people, we barely fit in each room, and did not have any time to linger in each room.

The swamp tour was relaxing and informative. Captain Brian was very knowledgeable about the swamps as well as the local wildlife, but he's fairly dry. He gave it a good effort and tried to make it fun. My recommendation: the tour would have been a lot more interesting if they made it more personal. It would have been interesting to hear about his family's experience, and what it's like living out in the bayous of Louisiana. Once we were back in the van, Billy told us that the airboat tours include the opportunity to hold a juvenile alligator, which would have easily been the favorite part of our vacation for our daughter, but sadly this is not included in the swamp tour, just the airboat.

Lastly, I did the math, and the value wasn't that great. We booked in advance with Viator, our total was $685 for 4 adults and a 3yo (not including alcohol, or $10 gratuity for each of our 3 tour guides, the awesome waitress, and of course Billy our driver). If we'd instead rented a car for the day, and booked all of the tours ourselves at full list price (and believe you me, Aaron doesn't pay list price), the total cost for the day would have been $379 + tax and tips.

Alternative (at list price):
Rental car for the day: $60
Oak Alley Plantation Tour: 4 x $20 = $80
Oak Alley Lunch: breakdown below
Cajun Medley: 4 x $16 = $64
Kids Chicken tenders: $10
Dessert: 5 x $4 = $20
Sweet Tea and Coffees: $20
Laura Plantation Tour: 4 x $20 = $80
Torres Swamp Tour: 5 x $11 = $44
Torres Swamp Tour kid's price: $10
TOTAL: $379

If I had it all to do over again, I might have booked with Grayline Tours for the larger and more comfortable bus; or more likely I'd go DIY style with a rental car and some podcasts of New Orleans history. I definitely would have saved the boat tour for a different day so we'd have more time to wander around Oak Alley. Trying to do two plantation tours and the boat ride in one day was enjoyable, but rushed.",2016-05-04 04:29:56

Our original intentions were to grab breakfast, but I guess his alarm clock had other ideas. Jason had mentioned  this spot or another location for some burgers that we could peruse.

Myself I had told him I have never been here , and right off the bat option 2 went out the window. Destination Zinburger was the place where we were heading.  No this other location was not Five Guys which is also located here (not that I am against 5 guys) All I heard from Jay was there are burgers , then there is Zin, a whole different level where everyone else was second.  Challenge accepted. 

Cherry Hill has a lot of options going on now ever since the race track was demolished. Nothing but  stores, restaurants and more stores for for the happy go lucky. I remember seeing Zinburger still under construction at the time, but as many times I have been in this area I kinda forgot about them. Plus the options here are endless with Cheesecake factory and so forth.  

I am finished in promoting the area, lets dive into this like a fat kid to a cupcake. 

OH mama mia a burger joint with a full bar with sports being played on the flat screens hanging. I already cracked a smile when I saw this, big beautiful bar, a sporting event being played. With plenty of libations to be had , this is where I want to be. The decor of the place is unique with the GINORMOUS COWS painted on the walls starring down at you. I found this somewhat comical, your looking at me, and yes I am eating one of your own in your honor. Plenty of seating to be had with booths and tables , outside tables for when the weather is better.  


Stephanie was our bartender , which by the way she is an awesome bartender. She'll make you feel comfortable, crack some jokes with you, also she will make sure you are well accommodated. Stephanie also will give you what's the popular burgers everyone craves , to the burger of the week. She also had me when she said she was a carnivore by expressing to me which burger she enjoyed. I think I found my soul mate. Stephanie~""Who comes to a burger bar and orders a salad! "", I agree with my carnivorous chicky.  

We started off with a couple Bloody Mary's, but this wasn't any ordinary concoction of Vodka and spice. Now myself I am not into the whole tomato juice , but when you substitute a celery stalk with a thick cut of bacon , I'm all for it.  I have had ""Bloody Marys'"" before , really wasn't to impressed with them. The Zinburger ""Bacon Bloody Mary"" is down right good.  Perfect amounts of spice, not too overpowering, pretty much made just right.

My perfect burger I had opted on the burger of the week, and plus the way Stephanie described seeing she just had one for breakfast I was all in . Zinburger does a burger of the week , where they think of something  creative and wham. I could not remember the name of this work of art, but it is similar to their ""Diablo"".  The Diablo has on it  fire roasted jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, caramelized onions & chipotle mayo.  The twist of it , they added  bacon, and pico de gallo , all held together on a brioche bun. PHENOMENAL!!.  

This was like angels playing the harp  in the back the way this melted in your mouth. Flavor upon flavors doing a number on my taste buds.  Yes I did moan a little , but you would too after taking a bite.  My partner in crime went with their Kobe cheeseburger , with the sounds he was making I am assuming this was delicious. We split an order of onion rings , which by the way was pretty damn good. 

Zinburger found a way to make this experience even better. Yes the bar is where you want to be, the staff alone is top rate and courteous, but I'm not talking about this.  Milkshakes is what I'm screaming. Their milkshake menu to their milkshakes of the month are out of this world. A great burger with a perfect milkshake equals pure bliss to be enjoyed. Brain freeze that never tasted better. I went with a salted carmel milkshake with nutella added to the mix. GLORIOUS I say.. glorious! 

In all this is a great place to enjoy a great tasting burger, enjoy the scenery inside or out. They have wifi service that prompted up fast for those who are in need. Great staff like I mentioned before, cleanliness, with a great product to be enjoyed.

I have reached perfect ""Zin"" !",2014-05-07 07:11:16

Just keep on walking, heed the Yelp ratings and save yourself the headache and frustration.

My main complaint is the service.  The hostess looks bored out of her mind and treats customers the same.  We were told it would be a 30-40 minute wait with barely any eye contact and that she would come find us when our table was ready.  But...the hostess changed so we went up to check on the status of a table, as was told we were still on the list.  First hostess returned and after 2 rounds of drinks for our party of four, and nearly an hour wait, we were shown to our table.  Before we could even sit, the hostess asked if we were there for the oysters because if we were, they were about an hour behind on shucking.  AND we then see a sign saying there is a limit of a dozen oysters per round of adult beverages and the drinks while waiting on a table doesn't count.  Huh.  She takes our drink order, we ask to put in food order at the same time.  I had asked how long for chips and salsa appetizer as we were all fairly hungry and we were told 'pretty quick.'  She returned with our drinks (mind you, water is served in 6-8 ounce plastic cups) minus a requested water in about 6-8 minutes...when asked about the 4th water we were told she only had 3 written down.  Can we get another?!  10 more minutes--sorry, we are out of chips and salsa, but the manager said they could still make us some, if we wanted, 'after bit.'  Nope...sorry, forget it.  Another round of beers come out.  Two of the three were cold-the third was warm with a cool bottle.  All the same, Corona.  Plus no limes, so we asked if they were out?  Nope, she could bring some, didnt know we wanted them (note--the 6 prior ones were we were served came with limes.)  Ummm...a goid server/waitress knows what to ask!  So sent it back.  Another came out the same way, warm.  Waitress told us they must have just stocked the cooler, but she could get a chilled glass with ice..  GREAT!  Warm beer and no appetizers or oyster specials.  This was all before 6:30pm.

Food came out and the soft shell crab on a plate that was ordered came out as a Po-Boy.  By this time, having invested an hour and 40 minutes there, he just started eating it.  We told her and her immediate response was 'I wrote it down right.'  The looks we gave her prompted her to ask if they could fix it and he told her nope, I am too hungry to wait.  So she grabbed another waitress/manager and stood a few feet from our table, pointed at us, and spoke loudly how she wrote it down right but the kitchen made it wrong and we wouldn't let them fix it.  I asked for more waters, she brought us extra napkins.  Asked for more waters again, and she said she would bring the jug.

To be fair, the food was decent--not fabulous but good and filling (Blackened chicken sandwich, shrimp PoBoy, Wedge salad with chicken, and Soft Shell crab.)  Service was terrible all the way around.  

Can't help but wonder if our waitress was new?  Or if she just didn't like her job, along with many others at the Blind Pelican.

My friend from highschool and I were doing this together, but her flight landed much earlier. She was there hours before me, and all of the volunteers were cleaning the place up. Vaccuuming, scrubbing the kitchen floor (which re-opened in late '07), sweeping, doing laundry, etc. It's an eccentric place. They rent rooms out by the hour, if you know what I mean.

I vividly remember everything. My airline lost my luggage and had to bring it to St Vincent's, so Brandy (working at the front desk) called them and told them the directions and kept talking to them to see where they were, and after talking to me briefly remembered my first and last name HOURS later when they arrived with my bag and had them tell me to come sign for my luggage.

Taylor is an interesting man. He does the laundry here. Or does he...? I've watched him do it, but the linens are all so...bleh. Peter (the owner) is also interesting. He's very into making money, so when he feels like making money he raised room rates a LOT. He also started asking our non-profit for more money to do ANYTHING. To use the kitchen that WE fixed. To use a closet. To keep our rooms.

He owns a nice home down the way and stops in from time to time.

""Sir Lickem"" is the best. He's definitely an oddball, but the reason this place is better now is because of him. He does repairs, mows the lawn, paints, cleans the pool, etc. The staff all has problems. I'm sure they did things they weren't proud of to survive, but they continue to happen years after the storm.
They all have interesting stories, especially Brandy and Taylor.

I definitely didn't feel that safe here sometimes, especially when I knew about a young couple living 2 doors down from the stairs across the hallway. They had a baby girl together and sometimes you could see into their room because the door would be open. I heard them fighting one night and the male kept hitting the baby because she was crying non-stop and he screamed for her to shut up, so the mother put up a fight and he ended up turning on the mom and smashing her head against the wall and we heard her crying hysterically. My friend and I called the police, but they rarely do anything here. Too many bad reports and they fine them or shut the place down, so they don't. In the same week, our volunteer supervisor's van was broken into and his supplies were stolen. And for some reason we all thought it was Taylor. It made sense.

They do have some roaches and rodents. Most of the rodents are in the courtyard or downstairs (I always caught small mice in the public bathroom off the kitchen, none in the rooms). In one room I stayed in, my friend and I had to wear HIGH heels to the bathroom and around the room. I didn't want to wear slippers or flipflops because I just had bad experiences with them. So we left highheels on our nightstand to slip on if we needed to walk around. We had a pet roach named ""Ratty"" because we swore he was as big as a rat (gross, I know). But he came out at night and I always put the flashlight on him and my friend would scream. Haha. I sprayed him and his little hole in the wall with roach killer, but he managed to survive every time. The group from Japan left these weird roach traps, so we left them out, but they didn't work.

Either way, I ended up joining AmeriCorps through Katrina Corps and after staying here in rooms/the dorm area during my volunteer times, I lived here. I went to Mojo's every morning. I loved the area. It's in a great area with lots of shopping, parks, restaurants, bars, markets, close to everything, nice houses. I could walk to the house Jefferson Davis died in, Trent Reznor's old house, Anne Rice's house, etc.

+ Brandy and the other lady working there are great help, especially since they'll call anyone for you or do anything to help you.
+ Location.
+ History.

No TV's, no working phones in rooms, the only TV/cable is in the common room downstairs.

Do not swim in the pool. It was cleaned out and re-filled, but I WILL tell you that the majority of the people who swim in it develop a rash sooner or later. That, plus the humidity and mosquito bites...ouch!

I love this building and wish I owned it. I would really make something out of it. Peter is slowly revamping the place...but super slowly. I think he should fix the balcony areas so people can walk on them (a previous reviewer mentioned them but you CANNOT WALK ON THEM because they are unstable and the wood is rotting). I did notice lawn chairs & a BBQ from the late 80's or something stuck out there. Funny!

Lots of people swear this place is haunted, because it WAS an orphanage & lots of babies/children died from Yellow Fever. I don't believe it, though. It's just old and weird here. And that howling? It's probably some crackhead sitting in the stairwell!",2009-03-06 22:45:44
nnzKpn988wipHjCMPmQk3A,PqqzgAKNuiG6ygigh-_1Qw,TSpHdDh29jxLsDj1nTrTfw,2.0,0,0,0,"For right now, I'm not terribly happy with the service I am receiving from this company. A month ago I was having issues with a very old HVAC system I had in place before seeing the Groupon deal associated with them. I went for the deal to see what my options would be. My system wasn't able to cool the house below 80 F in the later part of the day when the outside temperatures were 85 F or higher. It wasn't struggling to cool the house at night.

A very nice guy named Johnny came to the house and walked me through the issues with my current system. These were all things that I knew were problems anyway, so his recommendation to replace the whole shebang wasn't a surprise. He was very honest with me and i went with his recommendation. This is the reason for the second star in this review; I don't have any concerns with how he's been handling my issues within his capacity to do so.

The installers were scheduled for a Wednesday and I made arrangements to be off work so they could come in as early as noon and start the work. I arrived home just after noon, having not received the heads-up call that the technician was 30 mins out yet that was promised. At almost closing time, with no one having shown up yet, I was informed they had been trying to call me all day because the installers arrived at noon, and left already when no one was home. It turned out the had the wrong phone number (even though not even a week earlier they left a voicemail message for me about my initial service call) because someone wrote my number illegibly.

I took the entire next day off work and the installers came out, if a little later than I was told. They installed the system and left a whole in the plenum that I can slide 4 fingers into where they pushed my medicine cabinet back so far into the back of the closet that they also cracked my drywall on the other side. (I've included photos for both of these issues, maybe they'll last long enough for you to see them, gentle reader.) The unit has been running a lot for the last month and it can't keep the house temperature below 82 F in the later part of the day. It's currently 89 F outside and the house is at 84 F with the system running for the last 2 hours as I write this review.

I had Johnny come out about a week after the install and he didn't argue with me that the plenum was a problem and that the system wasn't cooling correctly. He checked the refrigerant levels and added 2 pounds of Freon after seeing how low it was. He called his supervisor, Chris, and told him about the hole in the plenum and the crack in the bathroom drywall. Johnny said that I would receive a call soon from Chris to work out the repair on the plenum and see what could be done about the drywall. So far, I've received a call from Jenny while I was at work and missed the call.  I called that number back and left a message, but to this day haven't spoken to any supervisors or anyone letting me know how the problem would be fixed.

For about a week, the System cooled the house like it should, but ran a lot more than seemed necessary. I called and he came out about two weeks later and was surprised the plenum hadn't been fixed. He also had to put a pound of Freon into the system and run a tracker through it so he can come back and check for leaks. He thinks this is the case, but the system is already struggling to cool and that was a week ago from today. He also apologized for the fact that the issues from the install weren't repaired. He said part of the problem could be the amount of cool air leaking out of the back of the plenum because of the size of the hole in it.

In summation, it seems that I am having issues with this company revolving around communication and quality of service. Despite the ratings from Angie's List and the BBB (which doesn't take reviews into consideration for scoring) this company may be facing some overall issues no matter their longevity. I am, however, still a customer and would love to be able to change the scoring on this review. That's up to Bayside Heating and Cooling at this point.",2019-07-05 19:42:03
2HajRRkrB-bPYay8EUe2lA,pa6glQGbGNFP-FZhITV0pQ,CYSPKiVdoPX3erovujnE9Q,2.0,3,0,1,"This review is solely based on the restaurant week experience. I was so surprised to see an eight-course meal menu for this restaurant CCD restaurant week official website, so I made a reservation right away for the first day of the restaurant week this past Sunday. We came with high expectations but left very disappointed. 

Unfortunately, their actual menu is not the same as the website. Because it was the first day of the restaurant week, the server was confused about their own menu. The website clearly listed that the pre-fixe pricing includes an eight-course meal (with the sixth course being the dry aged steak or grilled fish for two), and only the specialty cocktails are not part of the pre-fixe pricing. After multiple rounds of confusions, the manager decided to put a surcharge of $20pp/$10pp for the sixth course, but this surcharge was not even listed on the menu that was given to us. In addition, unlike the website claiming that only the sixth course is shared, we had to share each of the sixth course. Basically, the amount of food really is no different than a typical three/four course menu offered at other participants of restaurant week. Note: after the first day of restaurant week, the CCD website menu is now updated, although the restaurant manager claimed that they ""have no control of what's on the website"".  We were not given any sort of compensations for this discrepancy. 

Now, for the quality of dishes, we were even more disappointed. We ended up choosing the following six dishes from the menu and I've rated the dishes from one star * to four stars****. 
**Course 1 -Burrata Salad: The burrata was refreshing and paired well with the summer squash puree, but it was a really simple dish with very simple ingredients. There was no surprises, but did make a good start (at least that's what we thought). 
**Course 2 - White fish toast: The bread was toasted well, but the smoked fish was a little too salty. I did not hate the dish though. 
***Course 3 - Spanish Octopus: This was the best course of the meal. Initially we thought there was a generous amount but found out that most of the ingredients was potatoes. The octopus was cooked properly without being rubbery, and the flavors were on point and did taste like a proper Spanish tapa, although I've had much better ones at other tapa restaurants in Philly.
*Course 4 - Gnudi: This is one of the worst pasta dish I've had in a while. It's supposed to be similar to gnocchi with ricotta filling, but it tasted so much worse than a properly cooked gnocchi. The dish was served before the octopus in the wrong sequence, and was already semi-cold to begin with. The ricotta was not runny, and the flour was even partially raw. We were glad that there was only two pieces because we would not eat more anyways. 
*Course 5 - broiled miso cod: the cod is served with red pepper relish and eggplant with a foamy miso sauce. The cod is good quality, but all the supporting ingredients were such a bad decision. The red pepper was overly flavorful, stealing the show from the freshness of the fish completely. The eggplant was not cooked through and semi-cold already. It was a weird decision to foam the miso sauce as all the flavors are gone. 
*Course 6 - Roasted whole cauliflower. The dish was completely cold when it was served as we witnessed the server made three trips around the room before it was served to us. After sending it back, the cauliflower shrunk in size with more charred pieces outside. We felt like they just threw it in the fryer again. It was not as good as the other reviews claimed, and the dish was easily achievable with an air fryer at home. 
*Dessert - they served us two pieces of chocolate that tasted somewhat like the cake you can buy at a grocery store. The server claimed that we can have a sorbet instead only if we're allergic. Note: they decided to remove the dessert from the menu.  

We did not enjoy the service for our table at all and it was nothing compared to the server for the table next to us. I'm not sure if it was because we pointed out their menu was different on the website. We understood that it was the first day of restaurant week, but we could not tolerate cold or raw food in a meal. We remember the name of our server but I would not point his name out in this review. 

The ambiance for the restaurant was the only thing I thoroughly enjoyed. The decors and layout were very interesting, and I really enjoyed the side-by-side table for two people. The room temperature was a little too cold, and that might be another reason why the food was already cold when it was served.",2019-09-17 18:30:00
aNANWzKnirzg33Y4uzNoOA,O4Sf0UjlV80ZMdIEz9uBEg,ep1aKx3CB0GImQMJjR9Ikw,5.0,1,0,0,"I never thought that I would write a review about something that didn't involve food.  As it turns out, this one eventually did; more on that later....  
Since I became a real grownup and started buying cars that lasted longer than the tires that came with them, I've come to rank the tire buying experience among the least pleasant things I can think of.  My first few sets of tires after I moved to our great burg (I used to log 35K for work) were purchased from Discount Tire.  You know, the place that has the TV ad of the Granny throwing the tire through their store window.  Well, after I got tired of the bait & switch sales, super long waits for install & ""free rotations"" and tires that never lived up to the hype, I decided to get over the name and try Big O Tires.
Wow!  Fast service, good prices and tires that have outperformed the Michelin, Continentals and Bridgestones I've tried - now my rides all sport the Big O!
I inherited a car from out of state about a year ago and it had Big O's on it.  I took it to the W. 86th location and asked for a rotation and balance which they readily performed even though I wasn't the original owner and they were installed in another state.  After the rotation one of the tires seemed to have a leak; I took it back after a few weeks and they checked it out.  I was sure  that the leak was caused by an improper balancing job, cynic that I am.  After they graciously fixed it and showed me the nail that they extracted (dang, it looks like the one I left laying on the floor of the garage!) they declined to charge me for the repair.  When I decided to replace the two older tires they filled all with nitrogen - a $60.00 value elsewhere!
I thought they were merely good but yesterday they topped my wildest tire store dreams.  It's been cold - single digit cold - and one of the tires on the car my kids drive looked kind of low but I thought it would come back up when it warmed up.  As it turns out, before they even made it off our street the next morning to go to school (6:30 a.m.), the tire was blown and they were riding on the rim.  After shuttling them to N.C. and putting the doughnut spare on, I called Big O to check the schedule.  When I told them what happened they said ""sounds like a warranty issue"", I said ""well, you should look at it first""; we took the car over and I gave them the receipt (3 weeks until the 3 year warranty expired) and they said again ""probably a warranty issue"" - without looking at the tire!  ""Are you sure?"" - ""Definitely Warranty"". 
We brought the car in around 2:30 and also asked for an oil change (about $20.00 less than Jiffy Lube).  Even though it was pretty busy they  said it should be finished by closing time.  The wife and I went back a bit before 7:00 and even though it was just about closing time, they were going to stay late to get the job done.  I told them to go home to their families and we'd pick it up the next day.  When we went the next day, they gave me the ticket and said I was good to go.  ""Wait"" I said, ""let me pay you for the oil change at least"" - ""Merry Christmas"" was their reply.  
Sorry for such a long post, but I just had to tell this story.  
Here's where the food comes in:
After I went home I called Monical's Pizza across 86th Street @ Traders Point and sent over a pie to tide them over till closing...

DJU1MuG1AHq7sEiYJu-Omg,lrC5gsqOQzgD3ox01Ei5kA,qECYaSKjPAoNDUsTN33-PQ,1.0,3,0,0,"We arrived from the airport at approximately 10PM and got a shuttle to this location from the airport as required. We got to the kiosk and worked through the transaction with the virtual agent, but she had to get her manager involved because the transaction wasn't going through. She then informed us that the car we were going to rent had a maintenance hold on it, and thus, they couldn't rent us that car. She then proceeded to say that the 601 Loyola location only receives one car a day, and since that was the car they had received, they actually couldn't rent us a vehicle. It appeared to us that they were comfortable leaving us stranded until we pushed back.  

We then asked for her manager because she said she wasn't able to help us get a refund or make this right. Her manager got on the line and proceeded to tell us that he couldn't help. Ultimately, because we mentioned to him that the call was being recorded and his supervisor would be able to hear that he wasn't helping us, the manager got on the phone with the airport to price match the rate for a vehicle there. He ultimately said he could price match a rental at the airport, but that he couldn't help cover the cost of the taxi cab back to the airport because he didn't have the authority to approve that discount. (The taxi cab ride was approximately $40). 

We ultimately got a taxi back to the airport, arriving there at almost midnight now. The desk clerk at Hertz, Natoy, was extremely helpful. She reduced the overall fees by the cab fare we had just taken to get back from Loyola Avenue to the airport after understanding our situation. She was very polite, helpful, and accommodating. As someone who is born and raised in this area, I consider her to be a great example of how business operates in this city.  

I highly recommend renting through the airport as their personnel are professional. I would not recommend to anyone to rent through the 601 Loyola Avenue as their personnel do not have anyone working their that has a sense of accountability or wanting to make things right with consumers. The only reason I believe that we ultimately received a price match from the airport was because we mentioned that the call was recorded. Save yourself the trip of going back to the airport and just rent through the airport directly.",2014-12-31 23:19:41

I went to the mall yesterday to pick up a couple of things and wanted to check out some new fall fashion. Unfortunately Reno doesn't
have any high end retailers here. My bank account is thrilled with that :) Anyways I've only been here a handful of times in the last 4 years
and as malls go it's a nice one. I stopped and had lunch at the food court. I was really enjoying myself because there were no crowds at all
it was so pleasantly quiet. 

I always park near Macys' because it's definitely one of the better stores in the mall itself. I save my shopping there for last. I'm usually pretty
tired after I do the full loop. When I arrived it must been around 1p.m. . I was looking around the cosmetics area and saw two ladies standing 
behind the Dior counter. One was a younger girl and the other was a very old, overly made-up woman with the Dior apron on. First; let me tell
you about how I move through the world; I ALWAYS am extremely friendly and kind! This is just who I am and the impression I like to leave as I
go about my day. I asked them for help choosing a new mascara because in the past I've always known that they can have horrific ingredients to
give your lashes that long, beautiful look. They were not happy that I interrupted their conversation! Wow sorry I'm a customer!! I tried to get them
to help me out and they were both extremely rude to me! The old hag; just mouthed ""just use Dior"" without trying to help me to understand the ingredients 
in that brand. I do use some Dior products so I know it's a good brand. Finally I just couldn't take them anymore and said; "" I need to go find someone nice""!
I turned around and saw a vision of grace and beauty standing at the front of the section. 

Isabela was so sweet and helpful after I shared my bad experience with those other two losers! FYI; Guys, I don't say this kinda stuff easily! Anyway back to
the stunning Isabela. She looked like she could have stepped out of a Vogue cover shoot! She was made-up to perfection with out overdoing it. She was so gracious 
and helped me find exactly what I was looking for at a decent price too! Don't worry gals, I will share at the end :) I could see those two birds snickering at me over
the counters. I'm thinking of calling the manager tomorrow! Things are really though out there and they are hiring warm bodies for these minimum wage jobs! 
But still, Isabela should be commended. But then I think; she was just doing her job! Even though she was excellent at it. The mascara she helped me pick works
amazing and doesn't clump up at all. Isabela told me to come back and she would do my makeup for me. I will! I also think I should mention that I've never been a
big fan of makeup because it can be aging (like the lady at the Dior counter) and it's just not good for your skin. Skin is the largest organ of the body and it likes to
breathe. I've been a aesthetician for 25 years. My specialty has always been in the important area of anti-aging :) Why should any of us look any older than we
want to or feel? I say do whatever makes you happy!",2021-10-14 00:27:22
BwCvazodoiBU8kcX5nNjdw,B0fzg0eUWplNBzfSJsCFDg,5aZC1FwNiaRayaz7QhAN-Q,5.0,0,0,1,"I do admit that I had no idea of what to expect when someone suggested we try Ethopian food a few years ago. And after several visits, I still admit I do not fully comprehend this unique, mysterious, and genuinely intriguing cuisine. Yet, there is no mistaking the absolute joy 17 of my friends and I experienced during our recent visit to Amy's Ethopian restaurant on Murfreesboro Pike.

Eating in this friendly and welcoming establishment is both a cultural and a culinary experience. The menu is rather lengthy, so take your time reading it. And, If in doubt, simply ask your congenial server and host Alex (or Amy if she can be lured out of the kitchen where she works her magic.) Either of them will be glad to explain every item on the menu....flavor, level of heat (some can be very spicy), and more.

No plates. Everything is served on Injera, a type of thin, ever-so-slightly chewy bread made from Teff, a tiny grain lacking in gluten. (Ok...some people describe it like a pancake or a tortilla with thousands of tiny holes on one side. Observation: that also makes it ideal for absorbing the marvelous flavors of the food placed on it.)

During this visit I tasted and enjoyed several meat dishes: beef, chicken, and lamb. All were highly spiced, yet slightly different in nuances and texture. The beef was ground (Kitfo), the lamb and chicken were served as tender chunks, stewed. The menu is loaded with all sorts of protein but there are vegetarian options as well. And I simply cannot - save for reading the descriptions on the menu - tell what manner of intricate combinations Amy came up with in the kitchen for her flavor-FULL dishes. Suffice it to say, they were highly complex, extraordinarily flavorful, and utterly satisfying. 

One apparent unifying ingredient in several dishes was ""berbere."" Berbere is a ""mound of spices"" likely a blend of ground pepper(s) that adds heat, spiciness, and the deep red color to many of the stews and sides. Other spices found (although not necessarily discerned by my palate) included garlic, cumin, coriander, ginger, fenugreek, and turmeric which added a bright yellow color to the cabbage.

Utensils? As mentioned above, the food is served on a large piece of Injera while small baskets of rolled Injera are placed strategically around the table. Bottom line - no utensils. You simply tear off a piece of this mildly sour, ""sourdough tasting"" flatbread and grasp whatever food you wish to eat--hand to mouth, so to speak. No fork, spoon, or knife needed....although one of my fiends did ask for a fork to finish his delightful dinner.

Flavor and nuances? Chickpeas and lentils - were spicy and creamy. (The lentils were universally loved by our group.) The cabbage was stewed to perfect tenderness while the greens were a slightly different riff on the southern classic. By the way, Amy's printed menu reveals a lot of what's included, sans kitchen secrets, so take your time reading and deciding.

Many of the menu items list AWAZE....a type of spicy sauce or paste. IMHO they also should say AMAZE -- 'cause that's the kind of experience my friends and I had at Amy's.",2018-07-28 15:53:24
SY5DK4M5ihSMFJVCVUyCYQ,7UVH0pYhL1Mpvdt4rGFBMA,uB12vX5p9T8z0g2Eq3bBBQ,3.0,5,0,1,"In late 2013 I returned to Marigold Kitchen with fond memories of my first visit, but ended up highly disappointed. While before it felt like a warm, cozy home with casual service and unique food... it is no longer any of those things. Its pretentiousness has gone off the charts.

In 2011, the food was billed as several courses (maybe 4?), while amuse bouche treats came as out as lovely bite-sized surprises throughout the meal. In 2013, its now a ""14 course meal"" composed entirely of bite-sized ""courses"". 

The service TOTALLY killed the experience. 14 courses meant that servers were at our table constantly. Every few minutes, a server came to ceremoniously set our place for the next course, then the food came out with a flourish and long-winded explanation and instructions we had to follow when eating it. The tables were so close together that even when we weren't getting the full Marigold Technical Guide to Eating lecture, our conversation was interrupted by the neighboring table's lesson. It might be great for an awkward first date, but my husband and I actually wanted to hold a conversation with each other without constant interruptions. 

Also awful: allergies. When I made the reservation, I let them know my husband has a few food allergies. Both the hostess and server made a point of mentioning it and listing them (a little awkward for my husband to feel singled out, but thoughtful I guess). Then when the plates came out.... there were the foods he was allergic to. I guess because much of it is ""deconstructed"", they expected him to eat around it, as to not disturb the presentation? But it was highly annoying because nowhere in the 5-minute presentation for each plate did they point out the (known!) allergens or apologize for not modifying their plating. Luckily we spotted them all and he was able to avoid them. What was the point of confirming with us, if you're just going to ignore it? 

While the food was still tasty, I kept thinking that the taste itself was exactly the same as any other highly-rated restaurant in Philly. The only difference was the molecular gastronomy treatment. Full marks for the roasted corn ravioli, though - that was top notch.

It was awkward when the chef came out to greet the tables at the end of the night. I wanted to give my honest opinion, but it was clear from his air that he was just doing a victory lap, so I kept my opinion for Yelp.

I give the hostess points for being super friendly and accommodating - I called that we wouldn't make it due to a broken down car, and they graciously made room for us to come later in the evening. She was nothing but lovely.

Final shock: THE BILL! While we knew it was a set menu (for which they gave us a printed ""keepsake"" copy at the end of the night), never was the price of the meal discussed. It was $85 each, which I thought was absurd given that last time I checked, it was much cheaper and the amuse bouche treats were ""complementary"". 

Final strangeness - the final course was given to us as a to-go bag. Why bother listing it as a course, when you're treating it like a mint you grab at the hostess stand on the way out?",2014-03-20 19:24:07

I tried coming here this morning to grab a coffee and a pastry before work. I arrived at about 7:40am and by the time I left, it was about 8:20am. Not good. 

Drive through line didn't look too bad but as a rule of thumb I always opt for going inside the actual store because drive throughs can be notoriously slow and I dread getting stuck in there. Plus unlike other drive thrus you can't just 'leave' this one if you need to. Once you're in, you're in.

When I got inside, though, there was a line all the way to the door. Maybe I came in at a bad time or maybe it was just today...I dunno....

After about 5-8 mins of waiting in line, they took my order. I ordered a latte and a pastry. I went over to wait for my drink. The barista looked super pissed off for some odd reason. Like she hated her life, hated working at Starbuck's...etc. No offense, but I'd hate my life if I were a barista too, because it looks really boring, plus you gotta make drinks for really picky people. The only extra thing I requested in my drink was an extra shot, though, but she still looked like she wanted to kill me.

It took about 3 minutes to get the drink. But the pastry...the girl at the counter had told me the pastry would be ""ready over by the counter""....this is not the way they used to do it.

I waited about 5 extra minutes after getting my coffee for the pastry. I was getting anxious because I needed to be at work soon. 

I asked bitchy barista about the pastry and she was really rude when she said that I had to wait for it here because now they ""warm everything up."" Uhhh whut? What if I don't WANT my pastry ""warmed up"" ?? I hadn't planned to eat it until work anyway and I didn't want the chocolate bits all melty right away. Blegh. I waited another 10 mins or so and then I was like fuck this, I need to go to work, so I walked right out of the store even though I had already paid for the pastry.

Whatevs.

I've never done that before in my life but I was pretty irate and I needed to be somewhere. And then the real icing on the cake? I was trapped in the fucking parking lot because of the retarded ass design of the place. I had to effectively beg-gesture for other people to let me out and I barely squeezed out. I was swearing like a sailor and had road rage all the way to work. Fuuuck.

I've worked in costumer service for about 10 years, I realize for some people that isn't all that long but hey- point I'm trying to make is I know what it is like to work in the service industry, I therefore keep my yelping to positive reviews with this one exception. I'm going to start off by saying that I'm writing this review bc I love this place so much that I hope they can take this(if they even read it) as constructive criticism so that they can get the business of all the potential ""long time costumers"" they could have but whom they've driven away with bad costumer service so that their business can thrive and be around forever bc might I add the guy with the beard whom was wearing a kilt last week is awesome and the inventory at this place is a true gem. If they don't read this and the terrible service from one person continues to be terrible then I recommend you guys still give it a try bc everyone should- place itself really is awesome. Just please guy lighten up, you don't have to be overly nice to me nor jump of joy or even know my name but if I come at 9pm after I worked a 12hour day and I return movies from my bf's account, PAY the late fees on the account please don't be so rude and say ""no you cant rent movies it's not your account"" after you literally just charged me for something owed on that account and given that there's absolutely no way you don't remember at least my face! Also, why do you have to stop typing if I start using my phone while I'm at the counter? If you're speaking to me and I ignore you for my phone then by all means that'd make me rude but me texting and hearing ""let me know when you're done with your phone"" and pointing at the sign that says no phone and literally stopping typing in your computer is just so unnecessary. However many months ago my bf answered a call at the counter to get an update on biopsy results from his dad and staff member said ""you can't be on your phone"" to which I said ""it's his sister, he's getting an update on wetherhis dad has cancer or not"" and staff member topped it with ""I can't finish the transaction without him at the counter bc it's his account"" and didn't finalize anything until my bf came back inside after finishing his call. Anyway, tonight I created an account bc I refused to let this guy dictate my night but ruining our planned movie night; when I was at the counter I asked him why they have the silly rule of no phones at the counter and he had the audacity after being so rude to me so so so so so so so so many times to reply ""bc it's rude to me, it's not silly it's rude to me"" to which I replied ""no I don't think so, if you're speaking to me and I'm on my phone then yes I agree it's rude, but if you're looking at your computer screen and you're typing then yes it's rude"" he then proceeded to not tell me but shout at me ""it's rude is rude"" aahhhhhh ahsisrkebrorrkwjwowp i am not a person who complains bc god do I know how hard it is to work in service industry but really this calls for an exception- that's it, I'm going to cross my fingers that I can continue to build tolerance to keep going to this place from time to time and I just hope awesome beard man is there when I come in",2017-05-29 05:04:04

I felt very pressured to purchase it, as the sales women I worked with made sure to tell me that everything is sold off the rack and I probably would not be able to find that dress at another time. So I purchased the 1400$ dress thinking that it was the latest seasons design and would be unique. (Robin Jillian is he designer: almost no information can be found about the label online, so you have no way of knowing what the gown should be priced at. For a three year old design though, 1400 seems EXTREMELY steep) I am now finding out that my 1400$ gown is a design from 2012!!!! Now this is not a huge deal to me, but to pressure me into buying something because it may not be there much longer, when it has been there for 3 years is outrageous. I feel cheated in this respect and wish I had taken the time to look at more options. 

Now onto my recent issue with alterations. I was made to believe that this gown would be able to be taken in and up quite easily. It is far far easy and the dress will have to be basically reconstructed in order to fit me properly. My alterations are going to cost me almost as much as a brand new gown! 

I am thoroughly disappointed in the misleading sales tactics used by this shop. I understand that it is the job of a consultant to make a sale, but by deliberately lying to a bride who is making a very important decision? A wedding is something that only happens once in a lifetime (hopefully). Your sales tactics really should be less shady in this scenario.

I'm sure they don't offer exchanges, or I would simply bring my unaltered dress in and find something else, even though I live across the country. I usually try to give businesses the benefit of the doubt and an opportunity to make things right, but judging by my experience so far, I do not think it will happen. 

I will now spend the three months leading up to my wedding stressing about how I'm ever going to afford these alterations, and regretting my decision to have purchased this gown in the first place.

Thanks Jon's Bridal!",2015-06-21 21:45:43

One month later they closed all their Pinellas offices and their phones didn't work. I couldn't get ahold of my doctor or the office! Finally they responded when I wrote a negative review. They called me immediately and said they would not charge me to change my doctor from the one they fired to the new one they hired, Dr. Scott. 

Dr. Scott is a pretty nice, cool guy. Easy to talk to, but I had to drive to Tampa to see him, 45 mins away! Inconvenient. 

Then came Year 2. I renewed with Tetra because although they'd had issues they seemed to make an effort to resolve them. Today I was on my way to a dispensary to order hundreds of dollars worth of product because hey are having awesome sales because it's 420 week, and I saw an email that said they canceled my medical marijuana recommendation because I had not attended my 6th month appointment. hmmmm no one called me to tell me I needed an appointment. I called the office. 

They said there had been a mistake and even though my prescription expires over a month from now they would only give me a 5 day extension for my recommendation. You need both to go to a dispensary and buy products. 

I got to the dispensary and they were like well you can't buy much because you can only get 5 DAYS WORTH OF PRODUCT!

UNREAL! I was so pissed. I called Tetra up because they made me put down a $50 deposit for my appointment. I told them to cancel the payment I would be taking my business elsewhere if they could not remedy the situation, and they were incredibly rude!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I should have stuck with my initial review that they were awful. If it looks like a duck and it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, guess what?! It's a duck!

The reason these people have awful reviews is because people have had awful experiences here. 

The manager at the dispensary I went to did give me a great review for a clinic in Sarasota called Cannabis Theory. There's also one closer to me that's cheaper and it's in the same shopping/office center as trulieve Clearwater and it's cheaper than Tetra too! But apparently they are BOTH CHEAPER THAN TETRA!

Tetra, I can't wait to hear you have packed up and gone back to wherever you came from. Stop taking advantage of Floridians. 

We don't want you here!",2019-04-20 00:36:42

I'm a huge fan of Bill Graham and all things related to the original Fillmore location in San Fran during the counter-culture movement. In fact, if you really want to know the truth, in my former life my name was Sunshine and I was actually at the original location for many Dead, Big Brother and The Holding Company and Airplane shows when I ran around tripping while barefoot and bra-less with flowers in my hair during the Summer Of Love. True story. 

In all seriousness, I was super thrilled when this iconic name opened up a location right here in Philly. I'm not sure if the shows didn't line up or what the deal was that it took me so long to get here, but I finally made it!! My husband who had been here a few times for corporate events gushed about how much I would love it and how it's ""soooo you"". He was soooo right!!! 

The ultra cool 25,000 square foot industrial chic space is  an old restored Ajax Metal factory in Fishtown just a few miles from center city. Just when you think this section of town can't really get any cooler! There are many different groovy areas within the space to sit and grab a drink before or after your show...High tops, tufted metallic couches, lounge chairs, a large back bar, and an awesome semi wrap around booth in the back under an American flag mural. Get up close and check that bad boy out! It's made of old concert posters or tees I'm not sure, but you'll spot some of your favorite performers up there! Don't miss it! There's is of course the psychedelic painted VW bus in the middle so don't miss a shot with my boy Jimi's face or with the electric LIVE display made to look like the famous Philly LOVE statue. 

Even the restrooms were awesome with a huge communal sink and lots of vintage mirrors. It was exceptionally clean and I can't imagine with all of those stalls they have there would be much of a wait. 

The staff who were funky and tatted up were all very sweet. The bars had usual suspects (Lager, Magic Hat, Not Quite Pale Ale etc) and some more unique cans such as also. Not cheap though. Some will run you as much as $8-$10 but hey, it's a concert venue...it's to be expected. So is the $20 parking fee on concert nights. It was free for the other events. There is street parking not terribly far and if you're more familiar with the area, it's easy. For those who aren't, I say stick with the lot for safety reasons. 

There's The Foundry which is more of a small club/venue right there as well as Punchline Philly Comedy Club and Revolutions, a sports bar which has bowling also. It's a neat little section. Lots to offer! 

This 2,500 concert capacity/3,000 people event venue is by far the most fun, awesomely decorated, chill music venue in Philly. I have my eye set on it for my daughter's Bat-Mitzvah party. Hubs and I actually said to each other we would have had our wedding reception here in a heartbeat if it was around back then! Check it out if you're in the market for an alternative event space and definitely attend a show here!! Rock on! 

Peace, love and happiness always!",2017-07-04 17:59:06

My experience  has been awful. Last month we took our sweet 9 year old dog Charlie to Preppy Pets for a one night stay.  We filled out all the paperwork  including his feeding schedule. We packed his bag with his name on it and it included a baggie ( with his name on it) with dry dog food for night time and a container of Cesar's for breakfast also ( in a seperate baggie with his name on it) and a baggies with treats also labeled with his name. The bag also included 2 of his favorite toys. We dropped him off on a Monday morning at 10:00 AM  and my husband picked him up the next day at 10:00 AM. When I was unpacking his bag ALL the food was still in the bag along with his toys. None of the food baggies had been open.  I almost cried when I realized poor Charlie had not been fed in 24 hours while in Preppy  Pets care. I called right away and spoke to the day manager Rachel, she had no explanation other then saying this has never  happened before AND they had more then one Charlie staying there at the same time. I told her that was no excuse so she put me on hold forever and finally connected me to the person in the backroom who feeds the dogs.  That person said he was fed. I asked what food Charlie had eaten and she didn't know but he had been fed according to the chart. I then asked to speak to the owner and I was told he was unavailable  so I asked to please have him call me which no surprise he never did.  I called the following day and I was told the same thing. We had already scheduled Charlie for one day of daycare which was today.  I wanted to cancel but my husband said it would be okay, the last experience  was just a fluke and wouldn't happen again. He took Charlie in this morning and picked him up mid afternoon.  When Charlie got home I could tell he was really anxious. My husband said we can't take him back there! When he went to pick Charlie up they asked if he was a black and white dog, my husband said yes then he saw the guy grab Charlies vest and leash walk right past Charlie who was in a kennel and go in the back room and bring out a white dog with a black spot with our dogs leash and vest on and tried to hand the dog to my husband. Of course he said that isn't my dog. The guy conferred with another worker and finally my husband had to point out Charlie to him and they finally brought him with his vest and leash to my husband.  One of the two guys who my husband thinks was a manager apologized and said at the shift change our Charlie was  listed as Austin, the dog they tried to give my husband. How can you run a business like that? How can you be so unprofessional  you can't feed the dogs and get the dogs mixed up??? Do not take your dogs here is my advice, we will NEVER take Charlie there again!",2021-06-25 21:52:28

Now under new ownership ....went in for my scheduled appointment for my pup had spoke with the groomer Bruce and told him what I wanted.... they said they would call me when my dog was finished I dropped my dog off at a little after 9 and dogs appointment was 9:30 it was after 3:30 before I ever heard from anybody and that was because of my calling them a second time ....no one ever got back with me about my dog ....my dog sat in the kennel for a few hours...arrgh!  I let that go.. when I got home I realized that my dog's snout looked swollen ..didn't look right it wasn't that they'd hurt him or anything it was just that Bruce left the hair too long on his snout and it just needed a quick run with the Clippers. I thought to myself no big deal, tomorrow when I'm out I'll just run in there and they can take it off very quickly... now mind you I worked in a hair salon for over 30 years.... now I realize the Grooming Salon ISN'T identical to a hair salon however the way you treat customers should be ...when I spoke with the new owner the gentleman behind the desk he was rude sarcastic and reminded me of one of my six younger daughters when they were about 13 with that young girl i wont be one upped attitude......he told me that Bruce was just way too over booked and that he could not just run that down his nose very quickly.... I said okay fine... I thought a bit ridiculous as I've said I've worked in hair salon for years and this was something that could be done in literally 30 seconds or less.... I then notified him that I was leaving town and that I would not be able to come back.. with that he pretty much told me too bad! I then proceeded to tell Bruce that unfortunately because of the way this gentleman was treating me I would not be able to continue with Bruce's Services which were fabulous!.. the gentleman behind the counter then proceeded to throw me out told me to get out of the store and to take my CUTE LITTLE SMIRK (exact words) out the door with me that he owned that store and he was going to call the police......Police? REALLY??? He is a co-owner with a lady named Angie and boy did I feel bad for her at that point!

In my opinion the proper way to handle that situation would have been for him to say hang on a minute let me see if Bruce can fit you in... go back speak with Bruce have Bruce come out to me and say gosh I'm sorry I couldn't get you in maybe I can get you in another time... I felt that I was Bruce's client and that he should have been allowed to either take me or turn me away ..... my gosh we did this stuff all the time in the salon ...I'm serious it would not have taken more than 30 seconds. This was just a small spot down his nose.

As a business owner myself I would never treat a customer the way that I was treated ...
I believe the young man has been co-owner for about a week and he's already lost Bruce a customer!

The thing that bothered me the most about the situation was not so much that he was rude to me or sassy and belligerent..... it was that he was young and not very wise and that he probably went home this evening and spoke with his partner about his DRAMA for the day.... talking about how he owned that salon and how he let me have it and threw me out!..... Pathetic little man.... hopefully one day he will grow up and realize that he is totally wrong in the way he handled the situation and that he's costing himself money.... he's one of those people that his MOUTH will probably always be the RUINATION of him!! ....Again... his poor partner...",2017-05-05 00:26:47

Xi'an Sizzling Woks cook up some scrumptious authentic food originating from the Shaanxi province of China. The noodles here are thicker, wider, and longer than the norm. Knowing all this, I was more than excited to finally eat here.

THE FOOD:

CHINESE HAMBURGER ($3.50)
Aka ""Rou Jia mo"" or meat burger. Served by many street vendors in China for around a dollar, it's also possibly the oldest sandwich/burger in the world. Usually the pork is stewed for hours and seasoned with dozens of spices and stuffed in a flatbread called ""mo."" Muslims in Shaanxi have also substituted pork for beef or lamb. But we ordered the one with ""braised pork"" and it was tasty. However, I thought the burger was on the dryer side. And Although the bread was well cooked and the meat was tender, it was lacking in terms of flavors. 

XI'AN LIANG PI ($4.95)
Literally translated to ""coldskin."" This noodles dish was mostly sour, a tad spicy, and tangy. Although I was underwhelmed by the flavors. I recommend trying this dish once.

DUMPLING IN CHILI SAUCE ($5.95)
Steamed and made with pork and chives wrapped inside dough skin covered with chili sauce. It was really delicious. The meat was flavorful and the sauce gave a nice kick to the taste. 

SPICY MINCED PORK NOODLES SOUP ($6.95)
Curious on how this bowl of noodles compared to other noodles soups. Firstly, it's sour. Not too spicy. The noodles are well done in terms of texture. But I'm not a fan of scattered meats floating in a bowl of soup. 

BIANG BIANG NOODLES WITH GARLIC SCALLION SAUCE ($5.95)
WOW, these noodles are GIANGANTIC. Being the noodles addict I am, my eyeballs almost popped out of its sockets when my chopsticks started to lift up these noodles. Though not completely tasteless, I wasn't a fan. It lacked a certain richness in terms of flavors and texture. But you should order it once if you never had it. 

FYI- it's called Biang Biang Noodles because it's named after the sounds chefs make when they pull an slap the dough on the table. How cool, haha. 

THE SERVICE:
Our servers were very friendly and gracious. This is not the case of the most restaurants in Chinatown! These four dishes are probably their most popular ones. Prices are very reasonable as the two of us shared five dishes of food for $29. 

Overall, the food here can be summed in 3 words:
Authentic
Affordable
Awesome

I'll have to return a few times here to test other items from the menu, but they've made a good first impression.",2014-01-11 19:48:35

What a charming little spot to have breakfast or lunch!  Treehouse Cafe is located in the Trinity neighborhood, right on the corner of Monroe and 11th.  A glance down Monroe shows well-kept rowhouses on a tree-lined street.  Treehouse reminds me of times long past where many neighborhood streets had either a small corner store or cafe.  In the past, the owners would get to know the people in the neighborhood who regularly frequented the business.  Enter into Treehouse and you will find a comfortable, cozy environment.  Most of  the seating is at the counter but there are a couple of tables.

We were here in the late morning on a Tuesday.  When we entered, we weren't sure what to do and one of the employees told us to sit wherever we wanted, so we sat at the counter.  There were 3 women working there, one of whom was the owner.  Everybody was very friendly.

We gave our drink orders first.  My husband ordered a cappuccino and was asked what kind of milk he wanted in it.  He chose regular milk.  I ordered an iced tea.  At first, I was told to go to the refrigerated case and grab a bottle.  However, before I got out of my chair, one of the ladies brought it to me as well as a cup of ice.  The same thing happened when I was asked if I wanted sugar.  As I made a move to get some packets, they were brought to me.  My husband said that the cappuccino, while flavorful, could have been stronger.

We both got breakfast sandwiches.  My husband ordered the ""Treehouse Breakfast Sandwich"" which consists of: ""Western omelette, avocado, green peppers, onion, tomato and cheese"".  I wasn't sure which sandwich I wanted until one of the women suggested the Apple Tree Breakfast Sandwich"" which consists of:  ""Western omelette, cheese, caramelized apple, bacon on croissant"".  That sounded interesting, so that's what I got.

As for my sandwich---all I can say is --- wow!  This was the most unique breakfast sandwich that I ever had!  The croissant wasn't at all greasy.  Instead, it was flaky and tender.  The apples added an amazing flavor that melded very well with the other ingredients and gave the sandwich a touch of sweetness.  I'm going to dream about this sandwich LOL!

My husband, whose sandwich also came on a croissant, really liked it.  He thought all the ingredients worked very well together without one item overtaking the sandwich.  We both agree that next time we're in town, we are beating a path to Treehouse.

As we were eating our sandwiches, the owner was making the soup of the day from scratch.  We watched as she cut up all the ingredients for the chicken soup.  The phone rang and it was a customer asking when the soup would be ready!  It's so very impressive to see soup being made from scratch plus the fact that someone would call and ask about it, tells me that the homemade soups have to be incredibly good!

Later, when we returned to our hotel (which is 4 short blocks from Treehouse), we were chatting with the front desk clerk and told her we ate there.  She had never heard of Treehouse and asked us how we found it.  I said I found it when I was searching Yelp for places to eat near the hotel.  We told her all about our meal and she said that she will definitely go there!

Breakfast for the two of us cost us $21 before the tip---and it was worth every penny!  Just note that they are only open for lunch and breakfast and are closed on Sundays and Mondays.",2016-11-21 08:49:49

The ultrasound tech wasn't rude, but she also wasn't friendly. You would think that an ultrasound tech would be super friendly and sweet given their jobs. My wife and I have generally had amazing experiences with our ultrasound tech and this one was just ok. 

To give a little bit of background, my wife and I moved to Arizona a little over a year ago. We do not have any family out here. We made the sacrifice to so that I could grow in my career and so that my wife could be a stay at home mom with our newborn at the time. We moved out here just a week after our daughter was born. 

Fast forward a year later, we learn that we are having another baby. Exciting, right? Well we were super stoked, but like a lot of other people, we were effected by COVID. I couldn't go to any of my wife's appointments and ultrasounds like I did with our daughter. We were super excited when we found out that I could go at First Glimpse. We thought it was cool that there was a link that we could provide family and friends. The first time we went was several months ago, and as I said previously, the experience was ok. It was my wife, me, and our daughter. We decided to schedule another appointment when my wife was further along. 

My wife scheduled online and we had our appointment today. Upon arriving, the ultrasound tech was extremely rude. She told us that they did not allow children. She proceeded to tell us that it is in their website, as well as the email that was sent to us. She was making it seem like we were stupid and should have known. We explained to her that we live her with no family and have no one to watch our daughter. We told her that we brought our daughter last time and were not told that children were not allowed. With no sympathy at all, she told us that there is nothing she can do and that they are now more strict with their children policy. She also said that they plan on getting strict in the future because of the rise in COVID cases. Which, ok great, but that's not relevant to this visit. 

We ultimately had to leave after driving all the way down there. On our way out we told her the email did not say there were no children allowed. 

We understand the seriousness of COVID and we get it. We're not mad at the fact that they don't allow children. We are upset because of the way we were treated, the misinformation, and because overall this person didn't seem to care.  She could have offered us alternatives, she could have apologized and expressed sympathy, she could have offered a reschedule, but she did none of these things. 

I am attaching photos of the website and our email. It talks about allowing the mother and 3 additional adults, but it does not specifically state no children. If they are as strict as she says, it should be clear. They should put ""NO CHILDREN"" on their website and email (like this ultrasound tech alleged it said). They should also give a courtesy call to remind of your appointment and the COVID restrictions. Finally, she should have brought it up during our previous visit, also during COVID.  

Ultimately, we scheduled at another location. While they also did not allow children, but they were very polite about it and had amazing customer service. First Glimpse has lost our business and we will definitely not recommend them to anyone else.",2020-11-21 20:24:58

On a hot day, don't miss the Sea Lions or penguins, and when it's cold outside, the penguins parade down the sidewalk on Sunday afternoons to the delight of all, especially the penguins.  Also visit the giraffes in winter - they come inside and you can get close to the animals. 

Big tip: When it rains, the animals perk up and the crowds disappear, so that's a great time to poncho up and visit the zoo! 

Visit the restrooms upon entering, get a map and ask about new babies, then check the animal feeding times and make a manageable plan from there. The lions roar at feeding time, and it's unbelievable because you feel it more than hear it; last I checked feeding time was around 4 pm. 

If you've never been to a butterfly house, don't miss that wondrous experience.

The Children's Zoo is worth the $$ per person, but if you are going to ride the $$ train, and have a stroller, plan to ride the train full circuit, as you will be required to abandon your stroller at embarkment. Dont worry, no one will steal it. When you get off, you will want to be near restrooms or food, so plan your exit strategy before you even get on the train. Think of the train as a place to rest, not necessarily as a way to get around.

By the way, the carousel is a kid favorite, even though the animals are fake.

The Lakeside Cafe historically has the healthiest food selection, which, as a nature teacher I would like to see improve. It's important to feed the human animals a balanced diet too! I don't even take a waterbottle anymore because  drinking fountains are everywhere. Sometimes I bring our own snacks. Don't underestimate the heat or sun, which can do you in. Walk thru every misting fan you see and travel by way of shade as the animals do.

The River's Edge is a serious hike, but worth it if you have older kids or want to see any new babies.

Peacocks roam freely on the sidewalks near the Bird House and Big Cat Country, and turn out to be a kid favorite. Go figure.

I'm not going to tell you the best free parking spots, but for locals, the clue is a pancake turtle. The zoo is free, so if you have a baby or a stroller, do yourself a favor and pay for parking. Bring your own lunch and save some legs for the return trek to the car. Regrets, no easy metro stop.",2014-10-03 21:53:59

Don't come during a heat wave. Thought, mountains would be cooler. After research, even though it's right near the Santa Barbara County beaches, the Los Padres mountains somehow block the air flow from the ocean which creates a desert like setting in that area (Santa Ynez).

Camp host was not there so we decided to wait instead of driving further down to different campsites and risk losing it (Paradise and Los Prietos). 
- Waited about 7mins. Paid with camp host $30 for one night and $10 more for extra vehicle as max is 1. We asked if there was another site and she told us that the one we were booking was the only one. She did mention that since it was super hot, some campers did pack up early and leave. But, she can't give those away since it's already been paid for and they might even return at night. 
Camp host was also very friendly and asked us if we needed firewood and to let her know if we needed or had other questions.
- We stuck around until about 12-1pm. It got too hot that we decided to head down and maybe come back later at night. 
- Came back around 7pm after driving around the beach areas. 
- It remained hot throughout the night. I think by maybe 10-11pm, it was OK. 
- Lots of flies and bugs. We made a trap at night/morning for the yellow jackets. (search youtube.)
- Bathroom situation. Reason why I decided to come to this area was because they have flush bathrooms. For whatever reason, flush bathrooms were closed and they had about 4 portapotties. Now, 100+ weather and portapotty... DO NOT GO WELL TGTHR. I'll leave it at that. (I'm shuddering and gagging at the thought again.)
- Next to main road (Paradise Rd.). Site 5 is right near it so you will hear cars and see head lights at night. You will also hear occasional Turkey gobbles and cow mooing as it's right near a farm. 
- Sites are pretty spacious to spread around esp site 5. We had 2 SUVs and 3 tents up and we still had room. 
- I am 100% willing to return after the heatwave and flush bathrooms are back up again!",2020-08-17 20:10:04

Our elderly dog developed a cyst on his front paw which opened up left a bloody mess throughout the house on a Friday morning. Having brought him here once before and not wanting to try to find a new vet we called Animal Hospital of Dunedin. 

Dr Manfredi recommended they keep him over the weekend to take x-rays, bloodwork, a culture, and soak, clean, and wrap his wound. A vet called us daily with detailed updates on his status. When we picked him up on Monday afternoon we 2 meds and a super long bill for $715. All of the vets were with other customers and not wanting to wait up to 1/2 hour to speak with a vet, we left with very little information on care and next steps. Dr Manfredi left a message much later in the evening for us to call the next day. 2 days later we received a call with culture results that will require additional meds.   

Whenever you are dealing with an elderly animal who is likely to pass within the next 1-6 months, it is always an emotional decision making process weighing the expenses versus keeping the animal comfortable. If I had unlimited resources, I would always chose to do everything possible but that is not my reality. While I am very happy with the professionalism of Dr Manfredi, I question whether it was necessary to board our dog for 3 days and all of the expenses involved with that. I have to trust that it was but I hate the uncertainty that comes with these type of situations (like, when you take your car in for an oil change and walk out with a $400 bill). 

They did save me some money on the antibiotics by telling me I could have the script filled for free at Publix. I got the script filled and dropped it off at their clinic Friday morning so our dog could be on the meds while boarded, however, when I picked him up on Monday they handed me a new script for the same medication. I had to ask several different techs where the medication I had already provided was. They finally tracked it down but again this made me wonder what was going on.

I will likely ask neighbors and coworkers for vet recommendations for our other animals. Again, happy with the vet, question whether I was being overcharged for unnecessary services and medications. Questioning whether you have been 'taken for a ride' when you are trying to provide the best possible health care you can afford for your baby is not a good feeling.",2013-07-13 16:03:20

I decided just to share the facts of my experience and let you form your own opinions. I contacted MCK in November to make my appointment for my 65lb mixed breed who had never boarded before anywhere. I had a nice conversation with Tonya and felt reassured that this would be fine. I made my reservation with her and she said she would contact me at the first of December to confirm. The beginning of December came and no one contacted me so I called them. I was afraid my almost Christmas reservation could get difficult to obtain. It was a different person who called me back that time and said they had no reservation on file for me. That made me a little nervous but mistakes can happen. She had availability still and re-reserved the time for my dog. Drop off day came and it went pretty smoothly. I delivered Jack with his food clearly marked, his favorite toy, an old housecoat for him to snuggle up with and his leash and martingale collar. I told Tonya that I don't leave the martingale collar on him. He has a separate permanent collar. I was surprised that they got so little information from me. I had used MCK before for other dogs but that was probably 15 years ago or more and my info had changed. They had our 2 cell #s though so I figured that's what mattered most. 2-3 days into the trip I called to see how Jack was doing and left a message. That seems to be what you always have to do-leave a message. I didn't get a call back until more than 24 hours later. Tonya apologized at pickup and said somehow my message ended up in the received folder. When I picked Jack up, he was off leash and his martingale collar was still on his neck. She handed me his leash which was damp to the touch. My dog reeked of urine and so did his leash. Even the bandana he was wearing from his recent trip to the groomer's was filmy with urine. The big Ziploc I had given him with his dry food in it smelled of urine too. I did not get my housecoat back which is fine. His toy was damaged and tossed as soon as we got home. I had to bathe him immediately and soak his leash so that we could tolerate having either of them in the house. It was close to 48 hours before Jack was his old self. He was sleeping like a cat. Granted, this was his first boarding experience and that probably had much to do with it. I am trying to give them the benefit of the doubt as to why he was so urine smelly but I feel certain we won't be boarding again. This wasn't a great experience for either of us.",2015-12-28 21:45:21

Being travelling TO NOLA and currently leaving here and everytime someone asked I had to say ""hmm..not yet,sorry"" and no,i m not into let's judge just based on their fame.
Memorial day,Monday, we got there around 5 and it was opening with a few people already.  We sat at the bar to enjoy the happy hour and my red Sox playing on tv. We ordered the elderita (margarita with elderberry liqueur and grapefruit) nice,refreshing, not to strong,spirits (bourbon) and segura viuda cava brut (one of my favs and reminds me of home) each 5us and a super attentive (with serious attitude like a badass queen) bartender, also the corn dogs that again reminded me thr Dominican sausage ""longaniza"" so flavored,crispy and the elite dressing (a tiny bit) really good.
The staff is amazing, the captain and waiters are really informative, fast and they served us every plate on time,not in a hurry so we can enjoy everything. The complimentary bread is a trio of brioche with peppers *delicious*, cornbread and I dont remember, a good touch to start the meal.We started with the House made andouille and boudin, beautiful presentation, lots of flavor,enough to share and have a taste of it. Loved it. As a birthday detail they brought us a taste of a lettuce wrap with duck,Asian dressing that was delicious, we also had the gumbo which was really good and didnt have that super acidic afterstate,i loved it and they put It in two different plates so we could share. For entrees I had the fried chicken which is art. Yes. The thin and crispy like a panko crust,half a chicken (a small one not a goose) great portion, really good flavour,not greasy at all (could feel better a couple of bites) the mac and cheese so soft and yummy even and with cauliflower on it and a pepper romesco that was glorious.  In general that dish is really good and I couldnt finish it so next day was also delicious.  Hubs had thr andouille crusted gulf drum,also good portion,nice presentation, it was good,not fishy at all, so soft and well done,the dressing was really good and the dish itself (or him) needed  more and the shoestring potatoes were a good touch ,some of them too greasy. And overall a good satisfying dinner . We ordered the j.k souffle in advance cause it takes 30 mins to cook..but u didnt care at all for it. I know souffle isnt something with strong killer flavour but this one was like a limbo..no taste at all.
Again,the service is superb. They are super nice,professional and they know what they offer. The captain is so nice and give recommendations to tourists about where to go. We felt at home and the price?WORTH it. For the quality of everything????a great deal!

Ea4tdEltMLijSnRkSGgunA,t9bfJI2zvx-3eFrN2zvQnw,WgsLAKkx5XEi0sMH_E95RA,5.0,10,1,2,"I hiked this today and have to say that Cathedral Peak is an exhilarating experience and a true mental and physical challenge. Like the other Mission Canyon hikes, the terrain is gorgeous--like walking through a lesson book on the geological and botanical history of this area. There are grand sandstone formations and plenty of Manzanita trees here (one of the rarest trees in the world). The peak is just over 3300 vertical feet and you climb this in about 2-3 miles. That is to say, you gain elevation quickly, mostly on steep primitive single track trails and by climbing straight up boulders.

This trail is totally unmarked, fragmented and easy to get lost on. You'll be on a trail and then have to know to look for a vertical wall of rocks to climb instead of continuing up the path. Most people recommend doing this with someone who's hiked it before on your first attempt. Here's how to find it: begin at the end of Tunnel Road. Walk up the paved road about a mile until you get to the dirt trail head. Proceed uphill for a few minutes and take the trail junction on your left. It drops you down into mission creek. Cross the water, head right. Climb a few rocks and look for a small, steep trail on your left hand side. You take this all the way up, veering left at every junction.

Eventually the trail opens up in a bouldering area and you'll be scrambling all the way up to the peak over rocks that are sometimes 6 feet high. This hike is strenuous, but very manageable. Just be sure to bring an equally fit buddy with you. Slips are absolutely consequential and if you make a misstep, you could very well injure yourself. If you hike in shorts like me, you probably won't get through this one without some bloodshed. So prepare yourself for cuts and bruises. It's easy to sustain minor injuries and if you lose your footing on a rock, you'll be paying the price. You just can't let it happen at all! The way down is challenging too, since you're bouldering much of the way back on possibly tired legs. It's easy to get clumsy. The mental challenge here is staying sharp and focused throughout the hike.

Supply yourself with adequately tractioned shoes, plenty of water, and maybe even a few band aids. Otherwise, this is an absolutely awesome hike and you'll really feel a sense of accomplishment for completing it.",2008-06-30 04:24:16

I wanted breakfast so I got an egg white OMELETTE, she got a double CHEESEBURGER with fries.  We both loved our food and sampled the other's food.  Her FRIES were hot, thin, crispy - yum.  She loved the jam and toast.  My eggs were fluffy and delicious; her burger she scarfed down in 5 minutes. Food, good, will get even better with time.  

SERVICE was good too, no problems there. The hostess greeted us quickly and warmly. Our server was nice and attentive.  

DOLLARS: We both spent no more than what we thought we should. I also liked how breakfast potatoes/hashbrowns were not included in my meal - they are offered a la carte - because I don't want all those carbs, and carbs are not so popular these days, so it was smart for them to separate it like that.

THINK TWICE RE NEGATIVE REVIEWS: Regarding the negative reviews, this is a new restaurant, and, as both a foodie and someone who has opened 2 restaurants and worked the floor in both, I know it can take time for the staff to gel, for the kitchen to refine the menu, and so I have the patience and understanding to know that my meal was good and it will continue to get better (and probably why the kitchen is sticking to menu-only items as mentioned in Bryan S.'s review- I'm guessing they are trying to master the menu before experimenting).  

Peacock fills a void in the Loop - St. Louis has needed a diner and a 24 hour spot in the Loop, and ***I hope we patiently support the restaurant while the restaurant actively improves itself to make it a destination diner, not just the only diner in the Loop.***

********UPDATE based on SECOND VISIT:
I stopped in again this morning for breakfast alone.  My previous review still stands, with this new info:  this time, it was a lot of busier than my 1st time.  They seemed understaffed.

To improve, I'd recommend 2 things: 1)  scheduling staff;  2) increase standards used in the kitchen.

My meal was messed up and what should have taken 30 minutes for me to order, eat and pay, ended up taking an hour because it had to be remade; props for them noticing and comping my meal, as I would have done, had it happened to someone I served (and yep, it has). Would still go back and support.",2015-03-08 02:35:17

I love this place. It is the breakfast spot everyone needs to have in their rotation - a place where you can go by yourself on any given morning, belly up to the bar, and have a fantastic, affordable breakfast while chatting with friendly regulars and the lovely staff. I come here by myself all the time, and often find myself making excuses to go get something done with my car at Pep Boys and then come over here to wait. 

People who say it's hard to find parking in this neighbourhood... don't know how to park. There is ALWAYS parking within 1 block of their doorstep. Also, do you see that massive parking lot for Pep Boys right across the street? Yeah, you can park there too. Even without that resource, there's plenty of legit street parking nearby. 

I almost always get either an omelet or a breakfast sandwich, and they are both pinnacles of culinary perfection. Nothing cures a hangover like one of their breakfast sandwiches. I usually double-down on the carbs and order a side of home fries with the sandwich, because this place does home fries right. Well-seasoned, GRIDDLED shredded potatoes. None of that deep-fried potato chunk business. Those are not home fries. The tater tots are also a good look - they are seasoned with some kind of magical blend and they are super addictive.

Aside from the breakfast stalwarts, they have more creative items like bacon-stuffed pancakes and salted caramel french toast, plus specials that will knock your socks off with flavour and originality. This past weekend I shared that caramel french toast and an eggs benedict special that was supposed to come with red miso ham, but they had run out of the ham, so they let us sub in curried pork from another special. Holy cow, it was delicious. Perfect hollandaise sauce and the eggs were expertly poached. The french toast was out of this world, I only wish it had more of that delicious bourbon whipped cream. The salt really came through with the caramel and it was awesome.

I could seriously go on for days about how much I love I have for Grubhouse. There's rarely, if ever, a wait for a table, but if there is and you spy a spot at the bar, don't be shy! Those are the best seats in the house. The baked goods are all fabulous and made from scratch by the stunningly fabulous Susan, resident server extraordinaire. Don't leave without picking out something for later, you won't regret it. Coffee, both hot and iced, is always delicious and your bill will feel criminally inexpensive. Go out of your way to support the little guy and you won't regret it!",2014-12-08 20:29:08

Noble Pig Pizza - sweet fennel sausage, mortadella, spicy soppressata, pickled cherry peppers, caramelized onions, tomato sauce, fontina, parm
Lemon Buttermilk Pie - Fresh Berries

Embracing the new trend of Southern meets Italian, a concept popularized by Memphis' Hog & Hominy and seen as far off as Okra in Phoenix, Noble Crust burst onto the Tampa Bay / St. Petersburg scene in early 2015 and delivered by the guys who made Bonefish Grill a household name the sizable space espouses an immediate feel of commercial sensibility, the menu a clever collection of comfort foods with flavors that aim to please.

A rare stand-alone restaurant in Strip-Mall-centric St. Pete, two parking lots available for a space that looks boxy from the outside but more casually cluttered with several seating options including a Chef's counter once inside, it was just past four o'clock at the beginning of dinner service that our party of two approached the hostess podium and requesting seats with a good vantage of the lone television showing the Lightning vs. Islanders a communal hightop was suggested, the stools constructed of steel and thoroughly uncomfortable without seatbacks.  

Severely for lack in terms of air conditioning, the open patio letting damp heat in from one side while flames from the open kitchen further warmed the air, it was with a thorough ""dining-for-dummies"" explanation that a spunky young server presented the menu and eventually deciding to just give in rather than stop her the flow of superlatives lasted almost three full minutes, the result a lone cocktail while other recommendations were ignored.

Admittedly a ""pre-dinner"" stop, the main event to occur later at LOCALE, it was nonetheless in a total of four plates that appetites were entrusted and beginning with tender ricotta dumplings in thick sauce with briny bacon the meal started off strongly, the following plates arriving no more than five minutes later and undoubtedly a whole lot of food.

Sticking largely to signatures for this visit, the idea being to see how Nobel Crust executes on items from both ends of its chosen scope, entrees consisted of ""Sweet Tea Brined"" Fried Chicken with Watermelon Salad and the restaurant's eponymous Pizza, the former a half-bird with good breading but juiciness that falls short compared to the long-brined Mary's Organic version offered at Yardbird while the Pie was a far better showing of the Chef's talents with a crisp-yet-pliable crust heavily topped in three meats, pickled peppers, sweet onions and tomato sauce.

At this point a little sick to my stomach as a result of the early morning, heavy eating and indoor temperatures eclipsing eighty, it was in forgoing softserve or the waitress-pushed Rhubarb Parfait that the meal came to its ending, the choice between Budino and a daily special eventually yielding one hefty slice of Chess Pie elegantly topped with rich Whipped Cream and thoroughly imbued with the flavors of Lemon and Buttermilk.",2016-05-13 16:36:02

For my mother's 60th birthday (August 2020) we had planned a large surprise party with family and friends flying in from all over the country but COVID-19 upstaged us with a surprise of its' own.  So instead of a lavish party, we were left with a modest little vigil and I was left scrambling for a suitable gift to say, ""I'm sorry that COVID-19 ruined your 60th birthday and that you have not been able to see your extended family or friends for months but hey, remain positive for a healthy mental state as we get through this together.""  

Long story short, I decided to find an organic way to boost her self-esteem, confidence, and body image which lead me to talk with the owner of Uplift - Carla.  I explained my dilemma and asked for her assistance and we made an appointment for mother to come in for a bra fitting and to obtain shapewear.  I will point out that while my mother is the absolute nicest woman in the world she is not a size 4 or 6 (any more detail and I will not be welcomed home for Christmas) and self-confidence seems to reign more freely with her kids than herself.  Therefore, walking into Uplift or making an appointment for a bra fitting would be too emotionally encumbering to do on her own so after talking with Carla I knew this would be the perfect birthday gift.    

At the appointment, Carla had a compassionate, welcoming demeanor that immediately assuaged any fears or insecurities.  While the two women were confabulating and picking out new garments I sat in a very comfortable chair towards the front of the store and responded to emails staying out of the way.  I cannot tell you exactly how or why but as mother and I walked out of the store with her bounty in tow she had an aura of serenity about her.  Being a guy, I had no idea that a correctly fitted bra and some shapewear could have an almost immediate impact on one's disposition as they will walk a little taller and have more swagger.  It also did not go unnoticed from the other ladies at the office .

My advice for any guy looking for a thoughtful gift for any lady in their life is to connect with Carla at Uplift and talk through your ideation for a gift and give her a budget and get out of the way - she is the consummate professional and you will not be disappointed.",2020-10-06 20:49:51
-aRQRA-xCh459HbLoTWXXw,I0ie6wGHdwkJuf9cdQiRog,zLTLhABWzGvl0xiRd47qoA,1.0,5,0,0,"Purchased our third Dodge  Gr Caravan/ T&C type vehicle last year as a certified used with 25K miles from FB-D.
We have a laundry list of issues:
First we did purchase the Platinum (top tier) 3rd part warranty -- for a LOT of $ (yes - we ARE apparently the Suckers!) - I would not normally buy these but with all of the electronics / bells and whistles it seemed like a good protection - this is my wife's commuter and we do not want to get stuck with broken components, so we have 2 layers of protection the Extended Factory Warranty and this ""platinum"" policy.
Was sold to us (verbally by the sales person) as having Bluetooth, we did not check the list of features, it has the higher end entertainment / console and did not even consider that it might NOT have Bluetooth - after 5+ hours on the lot making the purchase the salesman was asking if we wanted him to set up the Bluetooth, we needed to get home and said no.  When I tried to set it up - the Bluetooth feature was not enabled / installed.  Since it was not on the paperwork we would have to pay for that $600.  ( Wife commutes into NJ - if we had known about this we would not have bought the T&C - a show stopper - however I guarantee they would have installed before the sale for a lot less that $600)
For the first oil change (should be included) we tried to use the express service - before leaving on vacation - 3 hour wait - no thanks.  Drove down the street and paid for the oil change ~$50 -- with the Synth Blend oil).
When we returned we brought it in to address the Passenger side rear door that had started to mis-operate, getting stuck 1/3 of the way open - and became very hard to move manually. Sounds trivial - but the door was hitting the kids in the head, or preventing them from getting out all together. They said they would have the ""flash"" the controller - but that is not covered by the Platinum Warranty and it would be $200 - I said no and I would have to come in an discuss.  When I arrived - they had done the ""free"" oil change - (WHAT?) - I did not say to change the Oil!  -- So now I had to talk with the sales manager (there were actually 2 other minor issues of service / sales follow up ) -- so at this point 5 things had gone wrong.

At this point I literally asked them to make an offer to buy the vehile back and he would not give me a price - granted I would have taken a 4-5K Loss and went elsewhere.

So they did do the Flash at no charge, credited us back the Oil Change, but the flash did not help the door, but we are so fed up we did not address immediately...  The door issue is intermittent and seems to be related to the temperature - happens more when it is hot - so through he winter less of an issue. 
 Move ahead to the next oil change - now the same door has a new issue that when the automatic locks - unlock the actuator makes a loud buzzing sound.   -- Guess what? - this is not covered! - I was out of town and had my wife pick it up.  
Next Oil change bring in again with the same complaints - still not covered - although they did Flash the door controller again - still not corrected.  - We make some calls to the Service manger - 4 x does not call back.  Finally after a week+ he does call and he says there is nothing he can do and  the 3rd party warranty issue will have to be address by the finance manger - my understanding was he was going to have the finance manager call me ( that is something he can do!) - of course no call.  

So now every time the door system unlocks - the buzzer is a great reminder of how we are getting screwed by FB! -- actually it is pretty embarrassing to drive anyone around - that this Certified Used vehicle was such a lemon and we got taken advantage of - basically we are left apologizing that they can't open the door - etc.

Now to this week - we go see the service manager, door still buzzing and having the door mis-operation on video - same story, "" Nothing I can do"" - promises to contact the Warranty company again and discuss with the Finance and or General Manger - promises to call the next day. 

Now 2 days later -- NOTHING - I have used FB Ford (company car)  and FB Nissan for my Pathfinder recently and I have to say the service quality at all three seems WAY worse than a few years ago.  All the same issues, indifference to your problems, no call backs - etc.  For the next car I will not even go on on of their lots.

And a last thing that drives me nuts - they send you an online survey and then do this robot call with this ridiculously transparent message ""While you were away you received this message"" and then the Service managers voice with a canned message "" Hello this is x - and I wanted to make sure all is good, please call me if you have any concerns""  --  He did't call - it is an automated system - how cheesy!  - In fact last week we had gotten these and we had not even been in for service.  ( It is like they are mocking us!)",2015-08-05 13:48:52

Atmosphere: this location used to be a restaurant I went to as a child a whole lot being as it was right down the street from my parents home. I was happy to see a thriving restaurant move in since it hasn't done well since the previous restaurant left. The interior can be a sports bar/ nicer restaurant whichever you prefer. They have a bar area but it is kind of opposite from the seats. It's not bad, nothing fancy. 

Drinks: we didn't get any alcoholic beverages, but the menu looked impressive. A lot of beer on tap, and cool looking martinis and mixed drinks. Looked as though they had a happy hour during the week. 

Food: so we ordered the wood fires wings. We are pretty picky with wings because there's a place we absolutely love, and not many wing flavors can compare. These wings were the closest we have found to our favorites. The only thing different was the crispness. I would have liked them to be a little more crunchy on the outside but seeing as they were smoked and then grilled they were excellent!! I will definitely get them again !  My husband ordered the famous Philly cheesesteak and fries, and I ordered the burger in special (burger topped with onions mushrooms shaved beef, cheese, crispy onions, and aujus gravy) and a side of veggies. (Because the veggies offset the unhealthyness of a huge burger ;). ) both were very good. I would say 4.5 out of 5 stars. The burger meat alone didn't have much flavor but the toppings gave it what it needed. I couldn't imagine ordering a plain burger though and enjoying it. Too bland. The Philly cheesesteak was really good and a lot of it. My husband only ate half and took the rest home. It wasn't as good as a real Philadelphia tony Luke's cheesesteak but it was pretty darn close. Fries were average. Nothing special. And veggies were carrots cauliflower and broccoli. Again, nothing crazy. 

Price: our total bill for all food and two iced teas was 40$ before tip. Average price for a meal like that. Burger ran me 14$, sandwich was 10$ wings were 10$. I would say the sandwich was the best bang for the buck as it was so large. 

Service: service was good. We got sat right away, server was very attentive and always filled our drinks back up. Granted we were there at 4:30pm so we beat the dinner rush. Every time I drive by its packed!!! So be careful with that. Guess that's a good thing though. 

Overall, I gave it a 5 star because of the overall experience. I will definitely be returning because their menu was very large and had a lot of options. I would recommend for sure!!! I want to try their BBQ next!! Enjoy guys!!",2016-05-16 00:30:45

Having arrived in time for happy hour, we started with cocktails and a couple discounted plates. I had a smoky, gingery scotch sour that they had called ""Pennicilin."" For Heather, it was a glass of the mango-passionfruit punch. With this, we had sliders and tacos on coconut-corn ""tortillas"" (more like arepas). 

The sliders were fantastic, with a wonderful vegan Russian dressing that balanced the lentil burgers perfectly. The tacos were underwhelming, though the tortilla-arepas were very nice.  I was very curious about the tobacco-infused Johnny Walker drink, but I didn't have the nerve to get it as my only cocktail (I had to drive).

We moved into the dining room and ordered a few more things: chickpea fries, Korean-style barbecue tofu, and gnocci. We also got a basil lemonade, which allegedly had fennel. (The allegations were never proven.)

The chickpea fries, alas, did not live up to hype. They were fine, but quite bland and served with an oddly huge vat of equally bland mayonnaise. Happily, we found a use for the mayo-vat as a fire suppressant for the excellent and very spicy barbecue tofu. The tofu looked just like chicken thighs, and eating these together, one could get the full range of flavors that the chef had squeezed into them.

The gnocci were perfect--pillowy on the inside and crisply fried on the outside. I almost wrote ""butter-fried,"" but I realize that can't be true. I therefore don't know how they did it--coconut oil? It was topped with remarkable fried herbs, which went soggy quite quickly but were really something special in those first instants. The squash hemispheres with which they were served were, in my mind, too firm for the dish, though I'm sure the chef would disagree. Their mushroom sauce was just the thing.

I would be glad to come back here. I actually liked it a good deal better than Vedge, which, although perhaps more artful, wasn't actually as good: give me sliders over salty pickles on a slate any day.

Heather's rebuttal: (1) The tacos were not as good as the sliders, but they were more than underwhelming. (2) The sliders were a bit drier than ideal. (3) The cocktails were wonderful and I failed to mention that. (4) ""Pillowy"" was just the right word for the gnocci.",2015-03-28 00:46:42

We came in a few weeks back for the final four games as this is a Michigan State watch bar and we thought it'd be fun to be around other cheering fans.   Besides the Spartan's not winning their game, it was not an enjoyable evening.   We had a table right near the bar with about 8 of us and immediately it was a challenge to get anybody's attention to get a drink order in.  Once we got drinks going we placed food orders for simple stuff like fries and wings.  After most of the order came, we questioned the waitress on where the order of 10 hot wings were and she came back and said they were coming shortly, then we got the wrong wing order which was left at the table while they tried yet again.  Near the end of the game, we finally received the order for the wings.   After having to ask multiple times, wrong order, etc I would have expected them to just comp the order of wings for the hassle (especially considering our table spent close to $500 during the course of a single basketball game), however not only did they not comp them, they charged us also for the order of the wrong wings!  Unbelievable.   

Then after horrible service, spending tons of money, the owner talks our group into doing a pickle back shot, which we agree to.  They also made an order of fireball shots for the staff that was hanging out in the immediate area.  After the owner walked away, she called up to the bar and told the waitress to make sure she charged us for the shots.  We were all sitting there dumbfounded as the owner positioned it as if she was offering us a round on the house.   The waitress then told us, ""sorry, that's her M.O.""  

Now today as I am going through and reconciling my credit card receipts, I notice they took it upon themselves to give themselves and additional tip on top of the already over-generous tip I gave that night.  I gave 20% despite the fact the waitress really should have gotten 10%.

Then after we left the bar that night, we looked back in to see the owner yelling at all of her employees.  This bar sucks.  The food is average sports bar food.  The service sucks.   The owner really sucks.   AVOID!!!

Going out with a ""bang"" on the last day in South Florida it was at a four-top in the corner of Datz that Saturday morning found us sat, and with perhaps the sunniest service ever received in a restaurant to-date it was in the sort of carbohydrate heavy indulgence that I love in which we partook, seven out of eight items absolutely immense and sinfully sweet with copiously refilled cups of coffee to wash it all down.

Undoubtedly Tampa's most trendy spot for breakfast and brunch, with previously visited bakery Dough next door, it was just after 10am that our group entered the already bustling space and with a pastry case up front and newspaper-style menus filled with no less than two-dozen options I'd have liked to taste the only question became where to draw the line.

Beginning first with a duo of desserts...er...appetizers, one from the case up front and the other piping hot from the small kitchen, it was a nearly 16oz brownie alongside a veritable loaf of pull-apart Monkey Bread that the meal began and with both exceedingly rich yet veering in very opposite directions the contrasts of temperatures, textures, and flavors had everyone's hand coming back for seconds or thirds, a part of the brownie still going home for later as a thick spiral of peanut butter threatened to fill one up and prevent proper enjoyment of entrees about to arrive.

Moving a bit slow due to the onslaught of diners it was to clever anecdotes, more coffee, and plenty of smiles that we were treated during the wait for round two, and having already asked for the brownie to be packed up as I found myself continually tempted to pick at small bites it was perhaps twenty minutes before the real show began - a trio of toasts and a tower of pancakes threatening to rival longtime favorites in cities like Chicago, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and LA in both caloric content and creativity, each item entirely made from scratch, including the breads, with the crunchy crème brûlée and creamy, tropically themed 'aloha' proving the best of the bunch, a small cup of reference standard grits almost forgotten amongst all the sweets.

At this point boxing up a few leftovers for my family's flight home it was almost mandatory to joke back with our server when he presented the bill without offering dessert and although a bit disappointed that most of their whimsical shirts were sold-out the receipt came with a surprise - one jumbo pumpkin cupcake buried beneath a mountain of icing and a housemade praline cap with a sticky note that said ""dessert.""",2014-12-11 16:24:00
Rzepgq8jS9-hxxs2bGei5w,sg6nsr05IGGO00b7m4bkIQ,i_FWONQD1ZBqrNE2b-M5Ug,5.0,0,0,0,"First off, let me say that we came here for our anniversary, and the staff really did a great job of treating us like royalty.  We got complimentary bread with some sort of delicious honey butter, a complimentary cheese cracker tart thing, complimentary sparkling rose, and a complimentary pair of cookies to go at the end of the meal.  Everyone loves getting stuff for free, and it was one thing after another.  On top of all that, the service really was outstanding--I don't think there was ever a point where we were waiting on a server for the next course.

Anyway, we got the tasting menu.  From this, we learned...get the tasting menu.  For the love of god, get the tasting menu!

I'm a critical, cynical, negative SOB.  I cannot stress this enough.  That said, this meal was impeccable.  I was literally searching for things to criticize, and the best I could come up with was that, of the nine(?) courses, two--the truffle corn agnolotti and the Rohan duck breast--had plates not 100% suited to shoveling the food into my face.  I think we can safely call this a winner.  Allow me to paint you a word picture.  

First course: Salmon and Cucumber 'Poke': This was...pretty good.  Not earth-shaking, but a nice way to start the meal: light, and flavorful.  I was glad that it didn't include the rice implied by the name ""poke,"" since the overall meal was already very filling. 

Second course: Crispy Fried Virginia Oyster: I don't like oysters.  However, I loved this dish.  It combined the always-pleasant crunch of fried...anything, really...with the light but savory flavor of oysters, wrapped in lettuce and slaw.  The sauce was tangy and fresh, and it could reasonably be eaten with your hands (my girlfriend did just that, though I used a fork and knife because I'm not a barbarian).

Third course: Miso Glazed New England Scallops: The glazed scallop sat atop a cube of fried cornbread; it was a bit of an exercise to try to slice both without crumbling the cornbread, but it was workable; after that, pile on the sweet and pickled onions and sauce, and boom, one ticket to Flavortown.

Fourth course: Truffle Corn Agnolotti: For those out there who, like me, had no idea what agnolotti is, it's a cheese ravioli.  The corn sauce and beech mushrooms went great with it, and kept the cheese from overpowering the rest of the plate--I don't like cheese, and I had no problem with this dish.  My only gripe was that it was served in a steep-sided plate, rather than a bowl--I probably looked ridiculous trying and failing to scoop everything up.  

Fifth course: Rohan Duck Breast: No, not ""Rohan"" like the Lord of the Rings.  ""Rohan,"" like ""Rohan duck.""  It's a thing.  Anyway, the bird was cooked to a perfect medium-rare, and went great with the curry-roasted peaches.  Curry-roasted peaches!  Who knew?  And farro?!  Literally the first time I've ever seen it outside an episode of Chopped.  Delicious.  However, another minor gripe: the vessel was not ideal; I had trouble scooping up the farro and sauce at the end.

Sixth course: Summertime Skirt Steak: This was honestly the best steak I've eaten in over a year. The steak was so tender that the knife was a formality; the cherry tomatoes and baby zucchini added even more juicy deliciousness, and the green chile relish... let me tell you about this sauce. It was...orgasmic.  The girlfriend was pretty much full, so I had the sacred boyfriend duty of scraping every last iota of her remaining sauce into my face.  You could drink it, it was so good.  Throw tequila in it and you'd have the best margarita ever made.  I cannot stress enough how much I loved this sauce.  I'm pretty sure the people at the next table over were disgusted by the sounds I was making while I ate it, but I didn't even care.  They should market this sauce and sell it on every streetcorner.

Cheese course: It included three cheeses, some nuts, and some fruit, along with some surprisingly tasty housemade crackers. Presumably, you were supposed to combine the fruits, nuts, and cheeses in appropriate pairs on the crackers...eh, I just slapped the cheese on like butter and ate them.  The goat cheese, I liked quite a bit...mild, with a very slight tang.  The others, I could take or leave, but I'm wise enough to know that's my failing; I'm not a big cheese guy.  The girlfriend seemed quite pleased, and she's a cheese buff.

Dessert: Blueberry Bavarian / Dark Chocolate Wafer.  This lemon cake with lemon yogurt mousse went great with the blueberry syrup (including blueberries), and was thankfully light and sweet, without being overly rich--by this point, we were dramatically full.  The dark chocolate wafer was rich, but small and crispy and delectable, and I convinced myself that it was like a digestive.  In truth, it was one of those things that, if there was a whole bowl in front of you, you would just eat until either the bowl was empty, or you died from sugar overdose.  Mmmmm.

Final Note: 10/10. The hype is very well-deserved.",2018-08-05 17:11:33
VQqz4a5k5NYlUdj57ChD8w,1kCh5bef88kJuEROh_x0qg,9CRWWbw3iOo4-9FMAO6nKw,2.0,6,2,1,"I was rooting for this place. We really wanted it here, and we were so excited about the ""guess our name"" posters (although I was grossly disappointed when the name was revealed), and eagerly anticipated the opening.

We started by trying the ice cream the first time. It was ok, but as a pastry chef I found that the ice cream flavor options were so creative that it made me really want to like this place!! I stopped by two or three weeks ago and got an ice cream cone that was stale. I ended up breaking off the cone around my ice cream and throwing it away. And I couldn't really taste much flavor in the ice cream I ordered (it was some sort of spicy vanilla that wasn't exactly spicy and I couldn't taste the vanilla). My date's ice cream was rather devoid of flavor, too.

I've had coffee here twice now, and today was the last straw. The first time I came in for coffee I also ordered a breakfast sandwich which was a huge disappointment. Not that it tasted bad (it was ok) but it looked like it was slapped together in a rush, which it was not done in a rush because I was the only customer there and I still waited FOREVER. Also the coffee was not good, but I gave it another shot today... that was a mistake.

Today I ordered an iced coffee with almond milk. Now in my time as a pastry chef I have also had some training on espresso machines and I at least know that you do not steam milk to pour on top of ice for an iced coffee. Furthermore this dude only filled the cup about 2/3 of the way with a mixture that consisted of a hot espresso shot on top of ice and steamed milk poured on top. Which of course melted my ice. And for the record, he did not give me almond milk. I have a lactose sensitivity (don't worry, I took pills for my prior ice cream tastings) which is why I ordered almond milk. However, I hate the taste of almond milk once it is steamed because it develops a flavor that to me basically tastes like a wooden popsicle stick, and even though he steamed my milk it did not have that wooden flavor that I always detect in steamed almond milk (also I checked my receipt after that and realized that he didn't charge me for almond milk either). It's a good thing that I only took two sips of the melted ice and steamed milk concoction before I threw it away, otherwise I could have gotten really sick.

Also, why is everyone who works there so miserable? There's a guy there who I thought was maybe a manager and he's always scowling and has headphones in, even when he's begrudgingly assisting customers. When we went to get ice cream a few weeks ago, the one guy behind the counter was friendly but didn't know the answers to some of our questions so he asked this angry guy to help us out and he barely answered our questions and kept his earbuds in the whole time. Furthermore the guy today was someone I had not encountered before and he was tolerable but when he rang me up for coffee this morning he didn't even bother telling me the total of my transaction, he just held his hand out for my payment. As I was discussing this with my boyfriend this morning (ok, more like I was ranting about it) he mentioned that it didn't seem as if anyone who works there takes pride in their business, and I agree. I understand the growing pains of opening a new restaurant, but what I've witnessed seems more like a death rattle to me.

(I do want to mention that I greatly appreciate the Halloween decorations here. Holiday decorating is something I'm really into, and I like the fact that FBP went all out and decorated. I just wish they would start putting that kind of effort into their service and their flavors because as I mentioned at the beginning, I REALLY wanted this place here in the neighborhood.)",2016-10-15 18:06:33
FCwMW6PC0n8C_kdv3lr2XQ,A9cXP_K95FRor1qxuUEu2g,y-gyNJJkCbmCuD1iEm5p9A,5.0,6,0,3,"After having visited a different urgent care type setting a week earlier, I wasn't particularly thrilled when my primary care physician wasn't available for a timely appointment and instead referred me to this setting, Franciscan Express Care. 

However, given my growing concern over some dehydration issues and an ongoing issue with my leg, I opted to go ahead and give Franciscan Express Care a chance. 

Located in the CityWay area of near downtown Indy, Franciscan Express Care is located across the street from my primary care physician but is situated somewhat better in that it has free parking and a pretty easily accessible building. The parking lot is smaller than expected, though it's fairly workable and does have accessible parking spots (though there's a slight grade to them). 

This same building offers urgent care, wellness programs, sports physicals, drug testing, occupational health, lab, and x-ray services. It's open from 7 am-11 pm daily, a definite plus in the world of urgent care. 

Because I am an active primary care patient of Franciscan, my registration process was fairly simple. I registered within a few minutes - the staff was friendly, though they were on the phone with a supervisor upon my arrival. They did apologize when they got off the phone. There was an electronic board that essentially told you where you were at in terms of waiting (without violating HIPAA). That was helpful and decreased the ""I'm waiting"" anxiety. Truthfully, the wait was rather short and I was taken back to do the usual pre-check followed by a visit with the physician's assistant. I believe here name was Sarah Thill, though I may be wrong. Regardless, she was incredibly compassionate, a great listener, asked good questions and expressed concerns that perhaps I should consider going to the ER. She opted to offer me an antibiotic with the recommendation that if I wasn't showing signs of improvement soon that I should go ahead and go to the ER for further evaluation. I was incredibly happy with her presence and the thoroughness of her evaluation that definitely went beyond the usual urgent care exam. 

I was easily in and out within an hour and my prescription was ready for me by the time I arrived at my pharmacy closer to my home. As things would pan out, a few days later I did end up being seen in the ER and admitted to the hospital for several days. So, essentially, the urgent care here really did their job and made a solid recommendation that ended up being 100% correct. I found the setting to be comfortable and the exam rooms to be more wheelchair-friendly than most urgent care settings I've been to in the past. 

While one never quite knows what to expect from urgent care given the different clinicians one may experience, my visit here was definitely positive and I would easily return should the need arise in the future. While I still prefer my primary care physician, this is a great alternative. As a matter of note, while I wasn't required to pay upfront because of my insurance my final bill ended up being just over $90 - a good 10-15% lower than most IU Health urgent care settings.",2019-12-02 01:37:09
_A_f26Pstz4Ud0ZXaYCY0g,K61wRZSMuo1dmyJGd5vVAQ,VaO-VW3e1kARkU9bP1E7Fw,4.0,7,2,3,"There are plenty of seafood places in New Orleans that would be considered more upscale than Felix's. That's exactly why I love the place! The atmosphere is pleasantly laid back... there's nothing fancy about the decor or the staff, and that was just what I was looking for.  

We'll get into the char-grilled oysters in a moment, cause if you know me, you know there are precious few consumables that I don't enjoy with a hint of smoke... but let's start with the raw.  Oysters took some getting used to for me as I was growing up. Young people without much exposure to these bivalves may view them as slimy, awkward to eat and well, kinda yucky. Not to mention the idea of consuming a whole creature in one bite can be offputting. There is allure, however, in their reputation as aphrodisiacs, and their transcendent history from poor man's feast to high society cocktail fare.

Oysters, like most seafood, must remain cold from the time they're farmed till they're either cooked or consumed raw. Locations not indigenous to these salt water creatures must have them shipped in, which adds to their cost. This makes oysters difficult to locate in cheaper restaurants with low overhead, which is why I am drawn to local Windy City spots such as Hugo's Frog Bar. Despite the pricier menu, many restaurants such as Hugo's, have a $1 oyster happy hour. This is a great way to enjoy a fancy treat in a fancy spot without necessarily breaking the bank.

I mention that last tidbit for a reason. While traveling in New Orleans, I was looking for something decidedly unfancy. Having experienced raw oysters under lavish circumstances, I wanted to tap into the simplicity and heartiness of these mollusks that evokes images of country folk enjoying them along the beach, in the bay or at the oyster shack. 

Felix's nailed this feeling for me with tasty precision. Bellying right up to the bar, we got perfect seats for watching the shuckers do their job... and they did it with an efficient muster. The staff looks rough around the edges, but it quickly became apparent that these were the sweetest guys to ever shuck a shell. 

The raw oysters arrived first and their size was intimidating in the most wonderful way. After preparing what looked to me like double shot as compared to a Chicago oyster, I got to experience the firm texture and sweet taste of a locally sourced Louisianian delicacy. The cocktail sauce garnish that Felix's provides comes with horseradish already in it... a time saver for me that I love. 

But none of that was even the best part. What touched this Midwestern Yelper was how happy it made the staff to watch my date and I enjoy these treats to such a tremendous degree. They loved that we loved it... they regularly slid us free ""shucked while we watched"" oysters while we ate... which has not happened to me once in my home town of Chicago. 

The char-grilled oysters were a whole other kind of phenomenal. Perfectly crusted and sizzling along the edges, with a mild taste accented perfectly by the smoke and a dash of lemon. I've had something that should've tasted that good at Shaw's Oysterfest here in Chi-town... but I'm totally ruined on Felix's now. 

So I got my oyster experience while rubbing elbows with my common man. Everyone on both sides of the bar was talking up great food and Louisianian hospitality... we got both at Felix's Restaurant and Oyster house and boy did it feel good!

Our salesman was Mike Lehr and he was fantastic. He was very knowledgeable of the units.  We never felt pressured at any point to buy something we did not need or want.  He gave us space when we requested it so that the wife and I could talk alone.  His patience was awesome as we walked around the lot and looked at other RVs that we were not even considering buying but just wanted to look at.  Overall we were very happy to be working with him.

We shopped for and picked out our unit then negotiated numbers for our trade-in of a boat on their RV on a Sunday morning.  Given that it was a Sunday they did not have any finance managers working so we could not complete the paperwork that day. Mike told us we would be scheduled for a sit down with the finance manager named Pam later that week and then we would ultimately do final delivery of the RV on the following Saturday. I spoke with Pam on Tuesday and Wednesday of that week as she got all of our information together and secured the financing.  When speaking to Pam we had specific instructions that we would need to sign paperwork on Friday afternoon since my wife had to work all day on Saturday. Pam agreed and said she would put us on her calendar for Friday afternoon. When we showed up on Friday afternoon we were told that Pam had left for the day. At a later time Pam told me that she forgot about our appointment.  That's not very professional of a business manager so that's the reason for one of the deductions on stars.

On Saturday when I showed up to do the walk-through for final delivery there was a couple things that were messed up. First and most annoying one was that there was no battery installed on the RV.  They claimed it was miscommunication because I did mention that I was going to eventually replace the lead acid battery with an AGM battery however, at no point did I say that I was going to bring my own battery and did not want a battery on the unit.  The second thing that was messed up was the weight distribution hitch. The tongue weight on the trailer was over 1000 pounds but they tried to install an under rated hitch on my truck and trailer. At first, Victor told me that the 1000 pound hitch would be just fine but that is a huge safety issue to have an under rated hitch. Due to the missing battery and having the wrong hitch installed which cost me even more time of waiting around for these to be fixed, that's another deduction of a star.

Our overall experience with this RV dealership was not the greatest.  Since this was our first RV purchase we didn't know what to expect, but I am pretty sure it wasn't supposed to be like this. I'm not sure we will return to this dealership.",2019-09-22 17:56:23
Hn6rRLjHMEx_4FEuBoADEQ,IX7XTL015xU1AnTVMrZlog,1dB08iL0k37RsevU2uJxvQ,5.0,3,0,1,"I recently had Plumb Plumbing come to my house to replumb it.  The house is an older house built in 1955, double-course brick walls.  It was expanded two times since the 50's, both in double-course brick.  So, needless to say...  Getting through the ""interior"" walls can be difficult in places where it used to be an outside wall.

Plumb was able to retrofit this house with ease.  They replaced the old galvanized plumbing with Wiersbo Aquapex, an industry standard.  I had them run a whole new line from the water main.  They brought out a trenching machine to cut through my asphault driveway to lay the new line.

The plumbing work took a total of two days.  In day one they hooked one of my bathrooms up to insure we had water for that evening.  In day two the entire plumbing job had been finished...  1 kitchen, surrounded by brick walls, in which they went from the Aquapex to copper for any lines that had to be exposed.  I had them run a copper water supply for hot and cold behind my refrigerator - the only real way to do it since it was surrounded mostly by double-course brick walls.  They ran the lines behind my refrigerator and then in the back my cabinets so that nothing that is exposed shows.  This was probably the most difficult area in the house to replumb - in the other areas they were able to cut holes in the plaster-finished wall to run the pipes inside the wall to areas that needed a new supply.  They did not run any ""exposed"" pipes on the outside, so the finished product looks like a neat ""professional"" install.

They did a total of 1 full bath, a 1/2 bath, one kitchen, and ONLY a cold water line to a 3/4 bath... which is in an area of the house that had newish (70's) copper plumbing.  They needed to run the new cold line due to the way the house had been built - when this area was designed the cold run was brought to that bathroom from the outside in a trench.  Only Plumb found this potential problem, and since they discovered it before starting work it was accounted for in the plan.  I had 4 plumbers quote this job, and Plumb were the only ones that discovered that issue...  They were the second I called, and I waited for the others to find the issue but they did not notice.  There was one provider who quoted the job cheaper than Plumb Plumbing, but since no one else seemed observant enough to find that issue for the 3/4 bath I decided that Plumb was the right company for the job.

It took a little while longer to repair the walls, as the sub-contractor they hired to do the work was busy after the plumbing install.  Once they arrived (Dimension Drywall), however, they were able to match the texture for all the walls that had been cut into for installation of new plumbing.

In addition to the plumbing work, I also had them install a 3M Aqua Pure charcoal/sediment filter in-line before coming into the house.  This may prevent the build-up that I suspect occurred in the old system, causing a severe lack of water pressure inside the house.  This is the symptom that prompted the replumbing job, as it had just been getting worse and worse for the last 10 years...  The water pressure is AMAZING now.  I put in a new showerhead that wouldn't have been possible without the additional pressure.  Also additionally to the house work, I had them install a new water supply in the front yard (line had to be laid under existing asphault as well...).  I decided to hook up the backyard plumbing myself.

PERHAPS I could have done it myself, but not as fast and not as nice.  These guys know what they are doing, and they will do an excellent job.",2017-02-22 17:44:21

I didn't expect this place to be classy but aesthetically chill at the same time. It just opened in Brandon and I remember always driving past it. One night, I decided to try it out with a friend. Two things about us 1) we're total foodies and fans of aesthetics and 2) we love happy hour. Combine both and you get Boca!

One thing that was kind of a turn off was how the waitress didn't even know about happy hour til we brought it up. She was pretty surprised about it. After asking, she also told us that we would have to sit outside for it. Kinda weird... but the overall experience overshadowed this event. 

We came at around 8:30 PM and happy hour was at 9 PM. They gladly let us kill time til 9 PM. But our stomachs didn't agree. We shared a sweet potato gnocchi and I'm glad we did because the portion was enough for both of us. Once 9 PM hit we went crazy. I don't exactly recall the price of the dishes on happy hour but I know it was definitely a lot cheaper than it's original one. I love oysters so of course I ordered the mesquite grilled oysters rockefeller. This oyster lover was not disappointed. (WARNING: the oysters are on a bed of SALT not quinoa. My friend made the fatal mistake of taking a spoonful in his mouth and then realizing it was salt... when he spit it out). Next we tried the banh mi flatbread. Being both Asian descent and also having close Viet friends, we were a little disappointed in his flatbread. To us, it seemed a Americanized. Don't get me wrong, it was still good but if you wanted an AUTHENTIC banh mi flatbread, I wouldn't suggest ordering this. We were feeling a little bit fancy and also ordered the cheese and charcuterie. It went great with the sangrias we ordered. 

Speaking of the sangrias, they were probably the main factors on the five stars. I love sweet drinks and this was probably the best sangria I've ever had. Ever since then, I've never tasted a sangria like this. We also ordered beer (i don't remember the name!!) but I do remember that one of them was blueberry and really good.

Overall, I had such a great experience here. The atmosphere was just perfect - a cool night with live acoustic music. The best part of it all was that everything we ordered (except the gnocchi) was part of the happy hour special. I hope Boca is ready for me to be a regular!!!",2016-05-03 21:45:04

So, DiNic's has been on the list of places to try. But, the lines were always too long to want to go there for lunch hour. Today, no problem as there was no training in the afternoon. I could try this place with no worries. 
I got to the market and found a spot to sit and order. A friendly woman asked for my order, of course I went pulled pork sandwich. I added provolone cheese and was then perplexed what to add. I asked for onions, she shook her head no. As if it would not work well in the sandwich. So I just stuck with cheese as my additive. 
I waited a long time for the sandwich to come out. When I did, she had the order wrong, it had peppers on it and I did not want. She realized it and took it away before it hit the counter. 
She had not heard my drink order, so I asked again and she got it quickly. 
Several minutes later my sandwich arrived. It was huge and thick. It has a lot of pork in it. The meat was tender, but lacking in some flavor pop. The cheese did add some flavor. I wanted some smokey goodness in the pork or a little pop of heat to it. Nope, it is pulled pork no additional pop. 
The bread was fresh and matched the sandwich well. The cheese was really sharp and flavor full, but not enough of it. 
The sandwich was huge and I was not able to finish it. 
I paid for my meal and wished it had been better. After all the raves I have heard about this place.
And now the strange after taste. The meal sticks with you. Hours later on occasion the flavor of the meat rises up from your belly and makes itself known. Yes, several hours later. Maybe, I should have brushed my teeth so much sooner after the meal? 

The long wait for a sandwich and unmet expectation in meaty flavorful goodness reduces the score to a 3 instead of 4. The missed order did not help any, how about a sorry about that or a free drink? Anything?",2014-07-02 02:37:21
HaFPfWO7chevzLwlPDkTIQ,OkvxB_0DqAlAE-DSjdPoGg,kpuyeH7GK6GzvHOYwHB7wA,5.0,6,0,1,"My decision to send my 13 year old daughter to Camp Jump Start was the best decision I have made in my life.  Jean (the founder) helped not just my child, but our whole family.  I sent my daughter to the 4 week session, but I really wish I had sent her to the 8 week session.  In 4 weeks, my daughter lost 20 lbs and has lost another 7 pounds in the one and a half months since she left camp.  She makes better food choices (when she left her diet consisted of mainly fast food, ice cream, frozen pizza and mac and cheese!).  She would literally not eat, unless it was something she really liked.  Now she eats healthy sandwiches, salads, etc...  She was forced to try different things at camp and she realized she actually likes a lot of healthier foods.  I was never able to get her to change that here.  Jean also helped us as a family.  Her parental weekly group calls, pushed us to make changes while my daughter was gone.  She gave us the strength to be stronger, to make better food choices, and help our child.  My husband has lost 20 pounds and I lost 27 in two and a half months! 
The Camp itself is just beautiful.  It is filled with trees and hills and a lake.  Just gorgeous.  You drive up a hill through the trees to the wooden cabins, mess hall, a pool, lake, etc.  It reminds me of the beautiful outdoor summer camps I went to as a child.  When I dropped her off, I remembered the excited and fear I had going to summer camp in the woods, as a kid, and how much I loved it and didn't want to leave when it was over.  
When we arrived, we saw another 70+ kids just like her.  Some bigger, some smaller, all nervous, but I could see her future friends.  These kids were just like her.  Now instead of my kid on the sidelines, not good at sports, not someone the other kids would consider pretty or cool.  Finally, she was among her people.  
Was camp hard?  Yes!  They worked hard, got lots of exercise.  They played sports, swam, did yoga, aerobics, had nutrition classes, (my daughter learned to ride a bike!!), and had group therapy classes based on their particular needs.  My daughter worked hard.  She learned that she can work hard, exercise, eat healthier and lose weight.  She can do all the things she wants too in life and succeed.  I think she felt helpless before and didn't know how to change.  They were also tough.  She couldn't cry her way out of things.  Mom gives in, the camp doesn't.  So she was forced to succeed and her self confidence improved.  Now she knows she can work hard, and mom knows she can too!  
My daughter still misses the camp experience.  She misses being with those kids.  She fit in at camp.  Everyone was like her.  They knew her struggles, they had them too.  She still keeps in touch with her camp friends and maybe we will go back next year.  Not just for the fitness and healthy eating, but also for the connections and the bonding she had with her people.  This camp is a life saver.",2018-08-23 15:51:05
81MMzatasSheD8RG7Ed8FQ,rzhf29Q9MTE_IjTGbRhbIA,vbNQyHZ1M8jz6jcR0jTU3Q,1.0,0,0,0,"There were 4 of us staying at the homewood suites last week. We had reserved 2 adjoining rooms for 3 nights. Our flight came in early in the morning, so we arrived to the hotel around 9:30am. We were told rooms for that day were not yet ready, which was expected, but that we could leave our names and cell phone numbers with the front desk and they would call us when they were. He said we should expect a call around noon. We were happy to check our 4 bags of luggage with the front desk, go explore Nashville, and then return where our room was ready. The hotel staff gave us tags to put on our luggage, which we did, and I put the stubs to each tag in my wallet for safe keeping. We then left our bags in the lobby with the front desk and left the hotel. 

We did not receive a call from the hotel and when 2:00pm rolled around, I called to check on our room status. The man who answered the phone said the lobby was full of people trying to check in and he wasn't aware I was on a waiting list to be called for a room. We went back to the hotel at 3:00pm. When we entered the lobby, it was not full of people trying to check in and our luggage was STILL SITTING in the SAME PLACE as where we left it 6 hours earlier, in the middle of the lobby in front of the desk. Our bags were NEVER checked and ANYONE could of stole our belongings from the lobby during the time we were gone. This is UNACCEPTABLE and we couldn't believe your staff ignored our 4 bags sitting right in front of them for 6 hours. PLUS our rooms STILL were not ready! We tried to check in and your staff took over 30 minutes to find two rooms for us to stay in. They kept saying rooms were not yet ready. Did the ""lobby full of people"" all get checked in before us? And I had purposefully reserved adjoining rooms, which we did not receive either. 

The front desk staff barely apologized to us as we explained how upset we were that our belongings were left for the taking for 6 hours. They were unhelpful and unapologetic. In addition, the room rates were both the same but one room was so much smaller than the other. 

Other issues we had:
- One of our credit cards was double charged and we had to call back twice after our trip to get credited.
- One of our rooms were only cleaned once during our stay
- Our other friends staying in another room were mistakenly checked out a day early and their room keys were deactivated leading to them being stuck outside the hotel late at night.

Overall, our stay was very disappointing. Staff were unhelpful and we were treated unfairly when our bags were left in the lobby. I called to complain to the general manager and he only wanted to talk about the bagge ordeal, not his unapologetic staff, and he only gave us a 15% credit for ONE day of our stay. I would not suggest staying at this hotel when you visit Nashville.",2013-10-23 18:46:13
mGj74YAy6CRu6vR28YUmmA,xm4hByjEUYn-z7Ke0ob-rQ,1cncsHKApeW1ubd5d9HoJw,2.0,13,3,2,"It's paining me to write this low review. Hop Sing was my favorite late night cocktail place in Philly. It was the perfect place to go after a late dinner. It has the whole speakeasy feel- you have to ring the bell, hand over your IDs, then you're allowed inside (if you're dressed appropriately) and seated in a room to go over the rules (no pictures, phone calls, cash only etc) before you're seated at a table. I've been many times, and have recommended it to my family and friends. However, the last time I was there my experience was terrible. We were a group of 6 and were seated at a table in the back. The place was about 3/4 full. The vibe is really relaxed, the room is really dark with candles at each table. Their cocktails are awesome. Very unique and delicious.. I think about $12-$14 each if I remember correctly and I think a 2 drink minimum per person. 

To make a long story short, drinks took MUCH longer than usual- 1 or 2 drinks were completely forgotten. One waiter finally served us one of the forgotten drinks, while another waiter about 5 minutes later dropped off the same drink and said it was on the house. Most of us ordered about 3 rounds of drinks. When we got our bill it was more than DOUBLE what it should have been. They even included the drink that was ""on the house"". We eventually realized with the waiter that the entire bill of the table next to us was on our tab. Keep in mind- this was a very calm discussion about the bill. The owner came over to try and smooth things over... he gave us all some liquor, and we explained everything to him. He was extremely annoyed that we were telling him what drinks needed to be removed from the bill. Then he came back with a revised bill which was still wrong. When we told the owner he became agitated and started asking us, well then what do you want to pay?? I felt like he thought we were trying to get out of paying, which is definitely not the case. I told him that we wanted to pay for what we got!! We eventually got the correct bill, but unfortunately the attitude and pretentious nature of the owner makes me never want to go back. It's really a shame because I always enjoyed it here.",2017-01-08 22:31:16
AhD9MGNmAIar4x-DI-9bpw,oCnLbe9OGnpyQBY4E90bVQ,QvHhFHrfLoRe-UbW4w_LPw,5.0,5,7,5,"To me this store is more than a place to shop for:

- books that tell you how to be a superior being
- books that clarify precisely how others are less superior than you
- ""precious"" gems
- stones with words of empowerment (encouragement?) painted on them
- chimey things
- a mollie katzen enchanted broccoli cookbook
- divination cards, sensitively rendered in dreamy watercolors
- gongs (various sizes)
- chimes that tinkle in the wind
- figurines that need a home
- sage bundles
- etcetera

It's homecoming. Unlike you lucky Christians and Catholics and Muslims and Hindus and Jews etc etc, I was RAISED on this stuff. My childhood home operated like a Shirley Maclaine safe house. And like they say: you can take the boy out of (a new age cult?), but you can't take that biz out of the boy.

For a while I avoided the place because I thought it was mainly tschotches (almost typed 'chakras'?) plus there's this imposing iron statue of a lion or something that guards the entry way -- you really have to want to go inside. (Actually it's a really welcome deterrent to the South Street flashmob lowlifes.)  

Anyway last week I tripped inside to purchase yes TWO books. You might know The Discipline of Freedom (Yoga Sutra Attributed to Patangali)? It's a vital yogic tome for the non-recovering types like myself. Honestly it's an amazing book for those of you out there whose minds make a lot of noise and bring you to crazytown places.

Upon glancing at the cover of one book jacket, I had the distinct sense of time travel; it was Autobiography of a Yogi, featuring a vibrant-hued and important-looking spiritual person on the cover. For much of my childhood, this book was a prime source of haunting, the yogi's luminous 'I'm gonna eat you' eyes watching you from the shelf.

To report my amazing find, I immediately unflipped my phone and dialed my mom's partner (I was raised by two mommies, if this helps fill out the story). She replied, cheerfully, ""Oh, I know! In my home I have TWO COPIES!!""

The folks running Garland of Letters must be given special praise for really knowing how to stock their shelves and serve their customers. In addition to handling perfectly normal me and my various requests for positively Byzantine texts, the front clerk had a couple of severe nutcases on her hands whom she handled easy-peasy.

Now, I do have one small tear to shed. I am absolutely not a fan of the gaggy patchouli fragrance that smogs the in-store air. Then again, if the goal is Nirvana, or in my case, reconnecting with childhood in all of its beautiful crystal colors, that's a small price to pay.",2010-07-08 18:45:02
EQcmr5JiOO5PWMvqSFTzDQ,Y4Q49w2m8lsrxckn059Agw,MCTnEaQ18LABgdS1MiH_uA,2.0,2,0,0,"For starters, I am a shy and polite person who usually toughens it out, but my experiences force me to share my feelings about JMG. 

Front Staff: When I was having to visit more frequently, specifically, Adriana would make me feel like I was a thorn in her side with her tone and snippy remarks (having worked as a receptionist in the medical field, this is very unprofessional). Over time, the front staff have seemed to become more cordial and professional, possibly because the staff has changed slightly over time. Elsa is almost always polite and Mariana is more of a toss-up. Referrals haven't always arrived on time, if at all, and it has usually been difficult to receive straightforward answers over the phone. They definitely don't make too large of an effort to relay/answer questions for you (I have called twice with inquiries and never gotten a response). They have made appointments for the wrong concerns and a few times the doctors themselves wouldn't know the reason for my visit. 

Technicians: I am not fond of Hilary. (She really asked me ""what is your reason for seeing us THIS time?"" with that exact inflection and she seemed very annoyed when calling me with results or messages). Ashley is honestly ""whatever"" (I have no better way of explaining it, because I don't dislike her but she's not exactly warm & fuzzy). Lastly, Kyle, who came across as nice and quiet, wasn't so on one occasion over the phone when I guess I was being too inquisitive (sorry that I like to stay informed about my health). I think Dr. C.'s feelings toward me may have influenced that.

Dr. Cummings: Jumped at the chance to ""solve"" my health conundrum at the time, but then I felt like old news after he ""fixed"" me. Sure, the first visit he seemed engaged and nice. Subsequent visits proved that he just loves the sound of his own voice and can be very condescending with dumbed-down ""visual aids"" (basically, uses hand motions to ""show"" and tell). On one occasion, he refused to add specific body parts to an Orthopedic referral because he wanted me to ""focus on one thing at a time"". With the amount of time it takes to see specialists in town, I was seething (saw the same orthopedist twice in about 4 months and she even asked why we didn't address all of it at once o.O). It took more forcefulness on my part to have them take an MRI (discovered a brain defect) and stop Loperamide treatment for the superbug-induced loose bowels (like the antacids, this can kill you). The one thing that annoys me the most is the fact that he can never remember ANYTHING and I end up repeating the same important detail 3 visits in a row -.-

N.P. Bernardi: Thankfully, she is no longer a provider at JMG. Not only did she send me to Physical Therapy without seeing an Orthopedist or similar specialist first, but would treat symptomatically if it didn't require antibiotics in my case. This, of course, caused me to make multiple unnecessary visits. She didn't seem to care much and was easily offended the first, last, and only time I did question her abilities. Ultimately, it was found that I had a serious intestinal superbug (her prescription of antacids exacerbated the situation and could have theoretically killed me) only when Dr. Cummings ""took over"". She called to give me the news and that was it. (Shortly after, I received a letter informing me of her departure to UCSB; coincidence?)

N.P. Victoria: *sigh* Her demeanor can be refreshing since she does tend to smile a lot and seems polite. On the other hand, she would say ""I don't know"" a lot during my appointments and a couple or so times send me home ""empty-handed"" (no referrals, alternatives, blood work, etc.), even refusing to refill a pre-existing prescription (arrived in pain pre-superbug diagnosis and left crying because she literally wouldn't do anything). The biggest gripe I have toward her is the fact that she prescribed Penicillin to a family member without knowing whether or not it was actually needed. After my superbug ordeal, it angered me to know that she is possibly one of the contributing practitioners to this deadly group of illnesses.

N.P. Erica: She is polite, seems engaged and intelligent, but I haven't seen her enough (that's kind of a plus, right?) to fully critique her. There was one time I can think of that she should have sent me to a specialist and didn't. Then again, she was new and (still) isn't familiar with my medical history. 

Conclusion: I'm stuck with this medical group because of my insurance and have to grin & bear it. It's sad how there isn't continuity of care (or an attempt to provide it) and that I had to be seen from Carpinteria to Goleta when I live in Santa Barbara. Since this wasn't always convenient, especially when very sick, they would throw a figurative fit whenever I did need to go to Urgent Care or the ER. I hope nobody else has had to have this bad of an experience with them!",2016-01-17 19:42:54
1M129Q-1J6bqtDuYRsu1oQ,wXdbkFZsfDR7utJvbWElyA,iwDv45C3fI1gMSDnJUBFiQ,5.0,2,0,1,"I was pleasantly surprised at having my expectations exceeded with this restaurant!  I have had limited exposure to Indian cuisine (mainly overcooked buffets that were disappointing).  But because I had read a number of good reviews, I decided to give this little shotgun layout restaurant a try.  

First, it is located near the intersection of Virginia and McCarthy, just west of where Virginia crosses over the interstates downtown.  I found parking along McCarthy since there isn't a separate lot for customers.  There is a sign (shingle) hanging out above the sidewalk that is pretty visible, but I found it a little confusing since the first name on the door is for the business next door.  (The doors have the emblem of Spice Box appear as a white decal on the glass.)  Once you enter from the outside, take a left to enter the narrow walk to the counter.  

Spice Box began as a food truck, so they learned to operate in a small place.  There is a limited number of seats inside the restaurant so they asked if I was getting something for there or ""to go"".  The food items are located on a blackboard at the back of the counter area.  Chilled beverages including beer, sodas, and bottled water are off to the right.  I got a hint of the Indian pop culture when I looked up at the ceiling where posters of Bollywood movies brightened up the otherwise dark interior.

There isn't really a wait staff;  mainly, you walk to the counter and give your order.  They call your name once your order is ready...in my case, less than ten minutes.  Still, the owner's husband was running the counter and had a very inviting personality and was willing to make recommendations if customers were first timers.  (He recommends the Indian Tacos as the best intro selection.)

Having read several reviews, I went with the Palak Paneer and upgraded to the Spice Rice as my side.  It also comes with Naan (a flatbread) as an additional side.  The Palak (Spinach) Paneer (cheese) was delicious!  The spinach was light and flavorful, but without the overpowering curry flavor that some Indian foods have.  Very light.  Very tasty. The Paneer lent a nice texture with a slight chew.  The Spice Rice had a little bit of heat and a touch of cilantro which complimented the spinach as well.  (I frequently had spinach and rice on each forkful.)

This was a very pleasant meal for someone new to Indian cuisine.  It tasted fresh and the staff was easy to communicate with and very willing to introduce their customers to their cuisine.  Check them out!

iQ-N59dJS4YqyUp_aOyiaA,ApOHR2fX6-k3VrJw6-Tcxg,vhDWGF-8BfsxvS7Zo5Wv2w,5.0,1,0,1,"Last November I wrote a long review of Abe Fisher, which had just opened the month before.  Yesterday my wife and I returned (why did we wait so long?  I can't tell you -- bad on us!).  The verdict it's just as amazing at it was last year.  First, let me mention that their service is at the pinnacle -- they should give classes to other restaurants about it.  Their menu has changed a lot since last year.  We started with two rather delicious cocktails: ""About Last Night"" and ""The Fedora"" -- both quite delicious and amazing. We ordered the tasting menu.  As I said last year, this is an incredible bargain for such level of food.  In NYC it would have been at least twice the price.

We were started off with two mini-rugelach served from a cigar box.  Both were sublime -- one was infused with bacon (although the dishes here are inspired by Ashekenzai Jewish cooking, they are, by no stretch of the imagination, kosher).  They just dissolved in your mouth and infused it with amazing taste.

The tasting menu, gives you one from each column (a nod to the Chinese restaurants so popular with Jews?).  From column 1 we had Salmon Gravlax and Chopped Liver (one of the few holdouts from last year).  Both had the typical feature of Abe Fisher -- amazing blends with distinctive but subtle spices.   The first is a nod the traditional bagels and lox, but has a mini potato pancake (latke) instead of the bagel -- just delicious.  The ""chopped liver"" is not chopped at all but pureed with a generous hunk of toasted homemade rye bread accompanied  by a sublime onion marinated in vinegar and some sort of spice.  All of the ingredients blended together into something sublime.

From column 2 we had ""Matzoh Brei"" and ""Broccoli Kugel"".  As far as I could see there was no matzoh in the matzoh brei -- it was smoked beef tongue and maple syrup topped by a perfect fried egg.  Really delicious.   The Kugel was a small piece of potato kugel (I think) with cheddar.  The florets of broccoli were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  We're not vegetarians (obviously), but the vegetables here are just sublime -- we could have been satisfied with them alone.

From Column 3 we have ""Veal Schnitzel Tacos"" (a holdover from the menu last year that we didn't get a chance to try) and ""Duck Blintzes"".  Both were first-rate.  My wife felt that the Veal tacos were the winner (but by a small margin).  Who would have thought of making tacos with fried veal and anchovy mayonnaise?  But it really worked!  I loved the duck blintzes -- duck confit barley, foie gras, cherry and celery -- all in a perfect blintz.  Choosing any one of these dishes would really be in the realm of quibbling.

We ended the meal with dessert.  Last time we had the really great ""bacon and egg cream"". It was still on the menu, but we wanted to try something different.  We had ""Fluffernutter crullers"" and ""Blueberry Crumb Cake"".  Both were wonderful -- the first had blueberries, peanut butter and whipped cream cheese over a mini fried donut.  The second, which might have sounded ordinary, was executed just perfectly.  The whole meal was a home run (or maybe a few).

Go, and enjoy!",2015-09-06 17:16:11
dfXoGfsReES7CvfklLvFaQ,NYQhaGdH4TawTxEKlg27HA,Fzd22oK4wFqGTU1BmMlSGw,1.0,4,1,0,"I've taken both childbirth class and prenatal yoga classes here and I'm not impressed by either.

Yoga classes were OK. I expected very clear instruction about position and how to do certain poses especially now in pregnancy. The instruction was vague and not precise. DIG Yoga offers much more meticulous care in explaining what poses do, how to do them properly, and how to adjust them based on your needs.

The prenatal classes were a complete joke. 
1. Schedule: First off, I signed up for a series that had to be rescheduled because they posted the wrong times. So right off the the bat, the class schedule was moved by about 5 weeks. When you're pregnant and counting the weeks and are trying to schedule out your third trimester, it matters. The other class in Philly that I wanted to take was booked by that point when they let me know, so I really didn't have much of a choice.
2. Timing: The L&D nurse who teaches them showed up late most of the time. The studio wasn't even open and we had to wait outside for the class to start. It's unprofessional of both the studio and the lecturer to make pregnant women wait outside. There was a day when we were waiting 20 minutes for the class to start - outside. There's always a lot of traffic and there's always some event in Philly - plan for it if you're teaching a class or at least open the studio so that we can go inside and use the bathroom. We're pregnant!
3. Content: The content of the classes was scattered, ill prepared, and Mari, who taught it constantly confused content already taught from our class with other classes. She wound up talking about her friends' and her experiences most of the time. For a class that's 15 hours long over the course of 5 sessions, I would say about 3 hours were of actual content. It was all focused on hospital births at Pennsylvania Hospital rather than just birth. We learned nothing about how to rotate babies or what exercises to do to get our bodies and our babies best ready for birth.
4. No Hands On: I thought we would practice breathing or massage with our partner - it was none of that. We just sat there for three hours. No getting up, no practicing poses for childbirth, or relaxation techniques, and no actual movement. 
5. Information: I found the information lacking substance. She didn't present peer reviewed studies to back up assertions and some of the information was just off. Her info on what causes hemorrhages was incompletely presented and her approach to interventions was very skewed. We (the participants in the class) were taking this class because we wanted to avoid medically unnecessary interventions as much as possible.
6. Personal Pet Peeve: When she spoke about doctors, she always referred to the person as ""he"" and the nurses as ""she"".  
7. The schedule again: the last class had to be rescheduled because the presenter had a work shift or school or something. While I understand that there are occasional conflicts, these things should be known ahead of time before the class is actually scheduled and people pay for it - especially for such a huge time commitment - or a substitute should be asked to teach the class. This shouldn't be a problem if the content of the class is well prepared. 

Lastly, considering that this is a place for mothers and mothers-to-be, they sell a lot of raw milk goods without any warnings to expectant mothers.

I took a Breastfeeding class and a Mother/Infant Assessment class through the birth center in Wilmington, DE and it was like night and day. The classes there are structured, have consistent content, show videos/demos, and cover materials in a logical manner. If you have access to those classes (they're a little out of the way), I highly recommend them.",2015-07-28 13:48:57
SoDnKCFShJfFLTItY_kbBw,FlSSjBNjKmzsOvALeWQ4YA,pg3LkB4AE0dRRbTtPUhbQQ,2.0,1,0,0,"Arrived in Boise for a 4 night stay at midnight, tired, and just needing to get to the hotel and get some sleep. The ""shuttle service"" was a city cab, that was not marked as theirs, and not found with the other cabs. We weren't given directions about how to find our ride (the cab) from the airport prior to our arrival and had to figure that out on our own. I will say, the front desk staff was very courteous and polite. 

We had not been  informed of the ongoing renovations to the first floor lobby, hallways, and breakfast room. There was no furniture at all in the lobby for us to meet our other family members when gathering for the day. On the first day I needed a ride to the airport for my rental car, and called for the ""shuttle"". 10 minutes later I got to the lobby and no cab. I waited outside, since again, the lobby had no furniture at all, and waited on the sidewalk out front. 15 minutes later I came back in and asked them to call to check on the taxi. The girl called, and apparently, the call was not sent or dispatched correctly, or something, but she said the cab would be right there. 45 minutes after my initial call for a shuttle, the cab got there. If I had a flight to catch, I wouldn't have made it. The cab driver was very surly, and offered no apology at all, shifting the blame to the hotel. He explained in detail why these hotel runs are a pain in the neck and financially inferior to other fares for him. 

The second day, my cousin's room wasn't cleaned at all, no bed made, not even towels. It was skipped entirely. When she called to let the front desk know, she was told the cleaning staff had gone for the day. And nothing was done. I had to go get clean towels for her. That day, my room had minimal service. The bathroom mirror wasn't cleaned, and beds were very poorly made. The next day her room was cleaned and she was in the room. The housekeeping staff went on and on about others who don't do their job and ""goof off"" instead of cleaning. The third day was about the same for our rooms. Bed linens were pulled up, but not straight on the bed and the little foot coverlet was not touched so it was all crooked and lumpy. When leaving, I checked the floor by our bed for anything that might had dropped, and found a toy car and a pretzel that were not ours, and had been there all 4 days of our stay.

Breakfast was very poor. The first day our hash browns hadn't been cooked. They had been dumped straight from the frozen bag into the warming tray. There was no fresh fruit at all, just the empty container, and we were there an hour before the end of breakfast. 2nd day breakfast was a bit better, but not much. I had to ask about the biscuits, and the staff brought some out. After that, we ate breakfast elsewhere. 

I do plan to return to the Boise area, but sorry to say, will be sure not to stay at this hotel again.",2016-06-17 17:47:02

Upon getting into the room it was just like the pictures spacious for my family, that was the main concern of mine and why we chose this hotel to stay at. The room was clean and comfortable. However, the two stars is given because of EDDY- who supposedly is the housekeeping stupidvisor...I mean supervisor. 

We had no issues until returning from dinner (around 11:30PM or so). We brought some ice cream from the store but forgot to get spoons so we just decided that we could just ask the front desk for some, for they have been accommodating thus far. My sister and I approach the counter to find someone. There was a man (eddy) with a off colored-beater collared shirt. He had glasses and was on the heavier built stature. He was sitting in the back room (we could see him from the counter) we got his attention to ask for some spoons. He acknowledged us from his sitting position, already with a irritated tone. ""What can I do for you?!"" We promptly asked for 5 spoons if he had, if not one would do just fine. He finally proceeds to us and said, again in an irritated tone, ""well, I can see if we even have any...we only have two!"" We took the spoons from him, said thank you and went up the elevator to our room on the third floor. 

We finally get into the room. My family and I getting ready for bed, about 10 mins later we got a phone call to our room. My younger sister answers the phone and says ""Hi"" and quick her face turned confused/sad. The POS eddy at the front desk told her that he is giving us a warning!! Too be quiet there is noise complaints. Knowing we weren't loud but just took the warning because obviously he was having a bad night. We then quietly started a movie on the tv and had our ice cream which we all shared the two spoons provided. During this time we realize that there is noise coming from the floor above us. 

About another 20 mins after the first call was made we got another phone call-yup from the same grouchy, rude, and misogynistic man eddy. This time my brother answered the phone, my brother firmly explaining that the noise is not from our room!! It was coming from the rooms above us. Sounded like kids running back and forth and a couple yelling at each other. He didn't wanna listen to him and he (I could hear him on the other end of the phone at this point) yelling to my brother, ""THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING!! OR I WILL KICK YOU OUT OF THIS HOTEL!"" Then he hangs up. 

My mom, who is not a happy camper when she hears the man yelling at my brother on the phone calls eddy back on phone. My mom is explaining to him it is not us and to not threaten to kick us out on the street. She invited him to come to our room so he could hear what we are hearing and to confirm it is NOT US! He refuses and keeps saying he will kick us out, last warning. The Conversation goes around in circles. But at one time he says that he is calling everyone in the area to give them warnings. My mom then proceeds to ask him, ""wait are you giving us a last warning because you think it's us or you don't know who exactly it is and you're calling everybody else in the area of the ""noise complaint?"" if that's the case you shouldn't be giving us a last warning. He then backtracks to saying that no it is you guys I came to your room and told us to be quiet. At this point we know he is a liar on top of everything else he portrayed to us because he did not come to our room to talk to us. 

This was not handled well and he still was saying he would kick us out. So my brother we decided to speak to the actual noise makers in rooms 418 & 419, who we're apologetic to my brother when he explained that they are going to get us kicked out for them making all the noise. After that my brother decided to go to the lobby and confront that POS whose name is, yup you guessed it EDDY, and told him no call our room again and don't threaten us to be kicked out again and to get his facts straight and actually investigate and not just throw threats out there! 

Tbh, our family did not get good rest last night because we were being held at fault for someone else's actions and a POS who wouldn't accurately do his job instead just accuses from the chair in his back room. We knew we could be kicked out at any point even tho nothing was our fault. This is my first stop for expressing my complaint. I will be going further through the corporate avenues as well. 

Also, EDDY you can kiss my ass!",2021-03-29 00:57:38

Some Good Notes About Z Gallerie: If they are out of an item they will special order it for you, call you when it comes in and if for some reason you aren't happy with it you can return it. I've had to do that once and returning it was not a problem. The way this store is set up by color scheme is truly amazing because it gives you color palettes to work with and amazing ideas for your home. Yes their prices may be a little on the higher side but you get what you pay for. The store is also very clean and bright and offers a variety of items - paintings, home decor, furniture, lighting, linens, dinnerware and even cool things around the holidays. They also have some good deals but you have to look out for those - I got a 20% off furniture deal which was great when I purchased dining chairs.

Some Not So Good Notes About Z Gallerie: I had been looking for a white leather dining chair for over a year and finally found it in this store. The order process was simple and they were honest in telling me that because the items were on back order it would be 6 weeks before they would come in. I was fortunate, mine came in ahead of time and I was able to get delivery by the next week. Now this is where the negative comments come in to play. My delivery guy was a liar - upon bringing my chairs in the home he made a smart comment about hoping I was handy because assembly was not part of the delivery service. I found this to sound off because I thought the sales associate at the store said this would be included. Needless to say I didn't tip him and called customer service immediately after he left. They did confirm that the delivery people were supposed to assemble my furniture. While they did send me a $50 gift card and told me the next delivery person would asstemble them to attempt to make up for this, when the next chair came in (one chair had a small hole in it and had to be exchanged) I told them I did not want the same delivery guy and guess who showed up at my door. The same liar that delivered the first set of chairs. I was pretty annoyed at this point and had to have my father assemble my chairs because I didn't want that guy back in my house. Needless to say that little issue with delivery pissed me off. I won't buy any large items from that store that need to be delivered - only items I can take home in my car with me.

Bottom line - high quality, designer style, great value for what you get but don't get anything delivered from the store.",2012-12-09 20:52:26
QYYNTPWG06Z6I1_U56QBBw,iwhhewAkxsLal8bVmtrDEg,va4585dgOHuZjqd6OOoBrQ,1.0,1,0,0,"Unfortunately for the very talented hygienists who have great bedside manner and good at what they do as well as the dentists who work there, the office staff leave a lot to be desired. My lack of satisfaction with the office staff can be attributed to 3 unique experiences that trace right back to them. 

1. They scheduled an appointment about a year ago with my wife for 6pm. When my wife arrived, they informed her in that moment that they bumped her up to 5:30pm without providing any sort of prior notification. No accommodations were offered and the next opportunity for a similar appointment was a month and a half out. 

2. Shortly after my wife's mishap, my 8 year old daughter had an appointment. During this appointment, my 8 year old daughter was informed she had her first cavity. This was the first time she had received news like this and she was scared to death. Consequently, she had a tantrum, which occurred after having recently had a school sponsored assembly about the importance of dental hygiene as well as having played an apparently traumatizing leappad game about scrubbing bugs off of teeth. While my wife and the attending dentist attempted to calm her, the office staff gossiped. Later that evening, my family had a visit from a state child services worker since an allegation of neglect was made (since she caused such a scene during her panic-induced tantrum). Fortunately, the child services worker and her supervisor saw right through this and promptly closed this case (my children are well cared for, but are children and act out at times nonetheless--especially when they are scared and/or tired). All in all, my children received this incident as an early wake up call to always be mindful about how they behave so all was not lost despite my wife's pleas to discontinue using this provider.

3. On 3/13/18, the office staff failed yet again. I arrived for an appointment that had been scheduled in December because that was their earliest availability (clinic-much?). I confirmed the appointment by online correspondence a day earlier. Meanwhile, the receptionist I attempted to check-in with had no clue who I was and pulled up my account. After reviewing my account, she blatantly lied to me. She said that she called me a day earlier and left a message to advise that my appointment had been cancelled because this office parted ways with the hygienist we had been assigned to. Now, it is important to note that we had 3 phone numbers on record and not one of them revealed any call history from this agency within the past month let alone the past day. Clearly there was no message. Even if this staff member had misdialed, I had 3 phone numbers on record that would have warranted a follow up call by any decent customer service standards. Then, the receptionist finally attempted to exhibit some semblance of customer service and asked if I wanted to reschedule. Meanwhile, I was so furious that I left work early, left half of my children home with a babysitter and made meal plans around this appointment that I could not risk experiencing yet another disappointment so I left without rescheduling.

To Summarize:
Cons: Poor customer service (Office Staff), Poor appointment availability-both routine matters and emergent, Not family friendly (will not schedule multiple family members same day, refers children elsewhere for routine maintenance, posted policies regarding treatment of children/families in back area is poor), Despite posted schedules-evening hours don't truly exist as you are rushed in for earlier appointments and rushed out if you are at the end of their work day

Pros: Great hygienists (have experiences with several of them as I was a patient since 2012), good dentists although they are a bit straight to the point, was generally seen within 15 minutes of appointment time / arrival

This office is best suited to meet the needs of a single individual who has no aversion to dentistry. If you have no dental issues, reduced potential for dental emergencies and only require routine maintenance, you might want to consider them. 

Meanwhile, If you have a family, steer clear. If you have other choices, carefully examine them and look elsewhere.",2018-03-14 17:08:32
fgjv_Zfc5Wnnlj8hYkeN6w,lhuRHeXQmhQhH4_Vy_EAsg,5J65PhaSFmOngOEQFYOVaw,2.0,4,5,0,"I did not swim or work out.  Only had lunch.  And was disappointed.

Service:  Took 20 minutes to get drinks, and only iced tea at that.  Needed a refill, and was told at length how much the server cared about customer service.  Still waited for a refill.  I can appreciate a new place working out the kinks, but this was beyond that.  3 servers walking around for a place half full should be able to get a drink.  I certainly understand this is not Galatoire's, but I get better service just about anywhere in the CBD.  That was disappointing.  A server shouldn't go on about how much they care and how good they are if they can't deliver.  This is casual dining, in a not packed place, and it still took all 3 of them to get me an iced tea.  Bizarre! 

Food:  How hard is it to screw up a burger?  This place knows.  They mix their regular ground beef with some kind of spicy sausage that makes it way spicy and makes it a strange texture.  The sausage component also makes it as greasy as you would imagine.  Fries were ok, but come on...that's all you got?  Wife's sandwich looked ok, but she seemed less than thrilled.  I mean, a club sandwich is pretty hard to screw up too.  But there is no excuse for that mess of a burger.  It was bad.  Not what anyone is expecting when you order a burger.  And adding cheese to a sausage burger was not a good call.  Just a hot, strange, greasy mess.  They had something like this on the menu, and I asked the server if maybe I got the wrong kind of patty.  She confirmed the worst.  Even the regular burger is made this way.  I direct them to Company Burger for Exhibit A of what a burger should be (and Luke for Exhibit B).  

Ambiance:  Its a cool vibe in there.  I like the TVs and whole setup is nice.  

Overall, I can't imagine going back, even though I live and work in the neighborhood.  I see where they are going with the concept, but just about EVERYTHING needs to be done better than what I experienced. I wanted to dig the spot because there are no good sports bars in the CBD, and this had potential.  I saw the owner (who have us a tour before today) sitting at the bar eating.  Would have been nice had he been managing as well. 

P.S. - There is a wobbly assed table at the window on the city side of the restaurant that needs immediate attention.",2013-01-17 19:39:41
ZOHHRfDhxYDlV4LdUZuXgQ,3CwMwbY9UgP-qvTDxNs_0g,jbJTF1zVmZsk4hea8hoeVA,3.0,16,5,10,"""""Mezze mezze.""  The term used by my Italian in laws meant ""some good, some not so good"".   They would say it accompanied by a shoulder shrug.  I'm doing the same for our two dining experiences at Fork.  Maybe our expectations were too high given the buzz about this place.  We'll return to give Fork another at bat to see what we missed the first two times.  If our third experience is like the first two, then three strikes and Fork is out.  

AMBIANCE:  Interesting but not the 'all that' we anticipated.  The light lined patio in the front is part of what makes one want to go in to this converted old bank building.  The main dining room has the benefit of being lined with big windows but seating is oddly arranged with some banquettes and too tight tables.  There are also sardine can tight tables in a secondary smaller room. (Tip:  Avoid that one.)   The bar has counter stools and a couple of high perch tables on the periphery with not a single spot of standard height seating.   High ceilings and lots of hard surfaces makes the acoustics poor.  

SERVICE:  Friendly on both visits.   

The first time we sat at the bar since all restaurant tables were full at 7:30 on a weeknight and we didn't want to wait 40 minutes for a table.  As evidence that not everyone has had  ""mezze mezze"" experiences at Fork, I offer up in fairness that these kinds of crowds typically come in due to good things.  

Applause for Jess, the bartender, who knew the menu well and could describe dishes to the people ordering from the dinner or dessert menus at the bar.  She was adept at mixing great cocktails while taking orders for and delivering food from the kitchen all with smiles for her customers.  She could teach a master class in how to get this right.  

Our second visit was at brunch on a Saturday late morning and the restaurant was nearly empty.  The server was very friendly but food coming out of the kitchen had long delays and one of our two dishes arrived lukewarm while the other was hot.  This suggests one dish waited on the other in the kitchen with coordination problems on the line or between the kitchen and server.  

FOOD:  This was the big disappointment; both flavors and presentation. Most dishes were just OK for flavors and some were off for temperature at service.  Food looked as if just plopped on the plate, presentation that suggests lack of attention in the kitchen.  Were this Denny's, we'd say that would be consistent with low expectations. But to have that happen at Fork was not what we expected.  On the plus side, the cinnamon donut holes with chocolate and peanut butter dipping sauces were as good as we heard.  We enjoyed them at the bar for dessert where they arrived piping hot out of the kitchen with interesting presentation.  (And at $9 in a size to easily serve 2 or 3, a good value too.) 

MENU / VALUE:  Broad number of options and across price points.  Choices range from $2 for a biscuit to $9 for a unique Caesar salad to $11 for a club sandwich to $14 for mushroom ravioli or trout to $25 for a flat iron steak.  Given the range of prices and options, seems that two could dine well at Fork without libations in the mix for as little as $40 before tax and tip.

LIBATIONS:  Full bar with great cocktails at on par prices.  Also have a decent number of wines by the glass and an extensive by bottle offering with an appropriate focus on NW wines.  Bottle prices seemed too high for lower end offerings, like King Estate Acrobat Pinot Gris for $40.  Higher end wines, like $127 for Leonetti Merlot, seemed on par.  Nearly four dozen bottled and canned beer options. 

THIS N THAT

1) GETTING IN THE DOOR:  Patio is on street level and entry to check in at the restaurant or dine inside is up a flight of stairs. For those who can't climb that many stairs, includes me as I have MS, Fork built a ramp along the side of the building with entry through a side room door. From the strollers parked in that side dining room during brunch, we'd say a number of folks use this access.  It is the law (ADA) to provide a ramp like this, of course, but not all places do it. 

2) COFFEE:  Worth singling out the coffee service as it is unusual.  Good dark roast, served in a huge mug is brewed as pour over.  At $3, you are allowed only one refill.  When we sat at the bar coffee was served piping hot.  At the brunch service, the first mug was served lukewarm.

3) ALAVITA NEXT DOOR:  Not big fans of Fork but we're smitten with  sibling, Alavita, located next door. Same owners. Italian themed.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/%C3%A0lavita-an-italian-joint-boise",2013-10-23 22:50:46

I can't help it, I still notice these things when I shop.  I still hear the conversations between employees and managers when I walk by them.... This store's E3 should be ASHAMED.  

I'm disabled and walk with a cane (hence why I no longer work retail...) and I can barely squeeze past the racks because they are too close together, there is fallen clothing that hasn't been picked up that I am constantly tripping over.  It's a hazard.  

The racks themselves are completely unshoppable.  The items are so jam packed onto the racks that you can hardly see what is on them let alone pull a hanger off of them, which is probably why there is so much clothing on the floor.  

NONE of the clothing sizes actually match the sizes or designers of the hangers, which means your recovery teams are being really lazy and just throwing anything on any hanger and the department supervisors don't even care.  

Saw something in the women's section, a JLO sweater and fell in love with it, only to find out that it was actually a misses size.  It would be one thing if a customer had put something back in the wrong spot.... but it was pretty obvious that an employee had just stuck a whole entire rack of sweaters in the wrong department.  That's just being lazy.  I'm actually between sizes, the misses sweater probably would have fit me, but anyone else that came along... probably not.  And I've been there.  It's heartbreaking.  I just left at that point.  (If you read my review for Burlington Coat Factory.... you can see where I went after, and how much I spent at another store.)

We also went in to get a watch battery changed.  Didn't happen.  I worked jewelry at kohls.  The girl didn't have the proper tools and was more worried about her replacement not being there and getting to her next job.  But honestly I felt really bad for her because she was injured and in pain, you could see it on her face and they would not let her leave even though she was suppose to be off the clock and already late for her next job.  (God I'm so glad I don't work for Corporate A$$H0l&$ anymore....)  

And ya know honestly... it would be one thing if this were the first time that this store had been in complete disarray and completely chaotic, but it wasn't.  It isn't.  Every time I go there, it's complete and utter insanity and we've probably been there at least 6 times in the year that we have lived here.  We've honestly started going to the Kohl's in Cherry Hill instead.  At least there I have my favorite restaurants near by, and considering we live in Delran.... it's not that much further of a drive.  

Yall better hope your district or regional manager doesn't decide to just pop in.... sorrynotsorry.",2015-09-01 21:06:55

So, it's exactly one year later and we just returned from our 3 night stay here at GSR again. We were happy overall with our room this year, everything was updated and it made for a more comfortable stay....however...due to other hotel occupants we were awakened each of the nights. I'll give you a run down as to the events:

Night #1 - I woke up to the sound of a woman in complete distress outside our door at 3:30am. I was so groggy that it took me awhile to assess the situation. I walked over to my door, peeked out and realized that is wasn't coming from the hallway, but room next door. I heard screams and they were getting louder. Then moans, then, well, you get it. Yep! A full on sex-capade. It was so ridiculous and I could hear everything. It's a good damn thing my kids didn't wake up! This went on for the next half hour. I felt like my ears were being raped. Looking back, I should have called the front desk, but I didn't want to draw more attention and wake up the kids. 

Night #2 -  drunks in the hallway, locked themselves out of their room at 4am. Laughing super loudly, repeating the words ""I forget my key card""

Night #3 - a full blown party in the HALLWAY outside our room, with lots of beer drinking and cigarettes at 1 am. My husband kindly asked them to move party back into their room. They did, but the smoke barreled through our room and made it hard to sleep breathing the fumes all night. 

Other issues I have are regarding the pool/restaurants. 

Pool - tried 2 days to rent an umbrella. They were ""sold out""  by 9:30am. How is this possible? It is ridiculously hot with the sun reflecting off the buildings, many people were complaining that there were just not many options for shade! Maybe the hotel can invest in several more umbrellas to make people a bit more comfortable down there? 

Restaurants - Starbucks - way, way, way huge line each morning. Only 2 employees working a holiday weekend? Took my husband 53 minutes to get coffee. 

Rim restaurant - this is the most unorganized restaurant I've ever been to. 
My family had one of the worst meals of all time. You forgot about my 9 year old son's dinner? Then admit that you gave it to another table? You then inform me that it would take 20-30 minutes to make the dish? You try and make up for it by offering him ice cream and cookies? Your duck dish was like shoe leather, other items such as wonton soup that we did not order arrived at our table and during the course of our meal, many trays of food were dropped, literally! Fried rice tasted old and waitress didn't know how to open our wine bottle. An Asian man in a suit at the reception booth just stood as all this happened? Is he the manager? Offered zero help. This place is so laughable. I feel bad for the wait staff as they tried their best to maneuver through this buffoonery. 

After a long holiday weekend usually one would feel relaxed/refreshed, nope not me. On our next trip up to Reno, we will definitely consider another hotel in the future.",2019-09-03 20:42:49

 I could just leave that as the review and it would be enough, and wholly accurate. However Yelp likes long reviews and I could go on about everything anyways. 

First up, our server Eric was great! We had only had Otaku at the Cherry Blossom festival a couple years back and had been meaning to go to the restaurant since it opened, but just got around to it. I asked him about their special, Sunday only, scallion pancake, and he shared what his favorite add on items were, ordered it. Done. Next, I pointed to the beer section on the menu, and before I could get the sentence out he was saying how we had to try a particular one as it was cool and refreshing, especially great as we were sitting outside. Done. My wife asked if she could get a coke float and he said he woukd whip one up, even though its not on the menu! Turns out all of gis recommendations were spot on, and he made ordering simple and fun.

Got my beer, and he was, again dead on, it was grapefruit flavored, (not too sour) cold, and perfect on a warm Sunday! He came back out to say they didn't have the ice cream ready, but it was being made, and then delivered the goods shortly after. Happy wife, happy life! 

An angel from food heaven arrived just after my wife had scarfed down her float, (without even offering me some, so I know its good) with a cast iron skillet with an epic dish for us to devour. I'm assuming she was an angel because we couldn't take our eyes off the skillet as she announced the dish, with a simple ""I'm so happy for you two!"" For the life of me I can't remember the name of the dish, but it's a scallion pancake thats only seeved on Sunday, and was one of the tastiest mixes of ingredients I've ever had! We just kept saying to each other gow amazing it was with every bite, and telling each other to try this morsel, and that flavor, until we were looking forlornly at a caste iron skillet that looked licked clean!
Maybe 3 seconds later Eric appearee like a Genie from the lamp, and asked me how everything was, amazeballs being the answer, and 2nd beer being ordered. 

Within a minute or two, I had my new favorite beer (and I'm more of a whiskey guy) and our Ramens!

So, I'll wrap this up by saying the Ramens, of course were amazing, and we were stuffed by the end of the bowl, I even got some of mine to go. Eric asked us if we wanted anything else, and my wife answered she was ready to pass out. To which Eric replied, Ah, Ramen coma, I know it well!""

So finally he brought us the check and mentioned that the coke float is on him as its not a menu item that he could ring up. This guy, without knowing it was already going to get tipped 35%, but that, for me just pushed it into the 50% range!

 As a side note, people, tip your servers, even when they're bad! It's how they earn their living... Tip them especially well when they're great! If you can't afford to tip well, then you shouldn't be at a service restaurant in my opinion. We go out sparingly because of this rule sometimes, but always have a great time, and can afford to treat our server appropriately.

Back to Otaku.... Amazeballs!!!!",2017-08-13 20:01:59
Wf8_nu--vQIi0krDVACqcg,-8iXJTodb3hrQHrc0SRxzQ,RZCdgoHGNtB4t9bbQvIDaA,1.0,3,0,0,"tldr; Do not live here. The management is the worst group of people I have ever dealt with. It is somewhat cheap, but I have lived at 2 other student living complexes and Wolf Run is by far the worst place I have ever lived. You probably have a better shot living at Motel 6.

I will begin with the pros: close to campus and very spacious rooms as compared to other student living complexes

Cons: the management team here is the most unprofessional group of people I have ever worked with. Upon move-in, there was mold growing on the walls in my bathroom. When I put in a service request to have it cleaned, a cleaning person showed up two weeks later. I had already cleaned it myself by that time. Our washer was leaking brown liquid and we put in a maintenance request as soon as we noticed. Our washer was not fixed until a month and a half later. Our air conditioner has been broken since May 25 and is still broken as I am writing this review (July 28). After arguing with the office over a few days, they told my roommates and I that we could move into a temporary unit at Wolf Run East the next MORNING. After sweating all day, we were finally granted access to the unit the next NIGHT. We called the office that whole day awaiting a response but they never answered the phone. Our fridge in the temporary unit was broken upon move-in, and they replaced it 44 days after. They did not even replace it with a new refrigerator, it is a staff members refrigerator who is currently out of town. We were left with no choice but to eat out every day and we are not able to be compensated by the office for these expenses. Upon moving into the temporary unit, they began construction on our old unit and we are unable to be in the unit from 9am - 6pm. Before construction started, they gave us five days notice to move out of the unit so construction may begin. Everyone was scrambling to move and pack up the apartment. By the fifth day, the office sent an email basically saying ""Actually, you don't need to move out today. Just have the common areas packed up before construction starts, we will let you know when that is."" We have received no compensation for all of the inconveniences regarding the washer, air conditioner, refrigerator, and having to move into a temporary unit while I am in a full load of credits during summer semester and working. They only compensated us $300 off rent for July due to the construction going on in our original unit. When we ask about repairs, we are constantly told ""it will be fixed this day,"" ""it will be fixed that day,"" ""I will send you an update as soon as I know."" These are always empty words as no repairs are made until a few weeks after they originally say and no updates are ever given. Also, the office never answers their phone most of the time. They say they have lunch from 2-3pm every day, but it's more like 12pm - 4:15pm. Do not live here.

Said it was for two and they said it would be a 15 min wait. I said I would wait, but in the back of my mind I was wondering why so long with 6 open tables and 5 more that needed to be cleaned. More people came in after the two of us, we waited around 20 mins before I bugged on the of workers to be seated and he finally seated us and 4 more groups that came in after me. The server was nice but the first thing he said was that he was brand new, I have no problem with that but he was so new he should not have been by him self trying to help customers. After looking at the menu for around 5 mins he came back and took our orders and drink orders we got the drinks pretty quick, but kept waiting for our starter salads to show up and they never did. So after 20 of waiting for our salads to show up we decided to leave. I asked the server to speak with the manager and this woman comes to talk to me and I tell her the story why I was leaving, she then tells me if I leave she can't fix the wrong that has happened, and as she is telling me this a guy walks over with a name badge that says Restaurant General Manager. I think to my self okay now something is going to be fixed and during the whole conversation I have with the woman he doesn't say a word, not a apology for having to wait so long nothing. Anyway back to talking with the woman supervisor, I tell her I don't want to wait any longer and she then says ""well if you leave you'll have to wait longer to get food somewhere else"" so I tell her good bye and I leave to walk across the street to Texas Roadhouse. And had the best dinner I have had in months!! 

In conclusion if you are in this area never go to this restaurant if you want your food in a timely manner, the rgm and the supervisor are not good leaders and definitely are not good at customer service. And the wait staff should not be faulted for the disaster of a chain restaurant, the fault is all on the management team.",2017-10-21 04:10:51
eDEeCpPWWJfoxRw7f-DfGQ,PTuedEpLlBo4gobyOfwlMg,KPPyh-vQI3IbbQJUcegBjg,4.0,6,5,3,"So I'm walking down the street with my brother on the way to the Dark Horse to meet up with other yelpers for our first attempt at quizzo and we run into Rebecca S. Laughing and joking, we open the door of the bar and go in with my loud ass leading the way. As I step through the door, my voice apparently and unbelievably immediately drops to a whisper, which I only discover  when both Rebecca and Emmett laugh and whisper back simultaneously, ""you're not in church."" Oh, but I was... it was just a church of drinking... the next week, I laughed for about fifteen minutes when I returned and followed in a boisterous trio of young guys only to hear them, too, unconsciously drop their voices to a whisper the instant they crossed the threshold...

The Dark Horse is a fantastic example of a colonial Philadelphia bar and as you wend your way up and back to the bar where Quizzo is held, you (or at least I) can only be awed by the luscious woods and labyrinthine beauty of the place. Each time I have been there, the downstairs is silent as a tomb regardless of the number of patrons inside. Disappointingly, the dining room and the Whiskey Bar have also been closed and I have been unable to explore to my satisfaction. The Quizzo bar, however, has consistently been hopping and I gotta say it's a cleverly done and competitive night with a fun and wide range of question types and categories. 

Beers are not cheap-- face it, you're still downtown, and lately Yuengling has been pushing their Light Lager so hard that they are making it impossible for the bar to do anything but run light specials (says the bartender who wears the soccer jersey). bleck. $4 lagers are a little much for me, but are really just the average price down here, so I can't really complain. The food was bar food, but good. Solid and fresh chicken fingers, crispy and salty fries (and a lot of them, too). Though I didn't eat it myself, I watched two people eat the hummus for over an hour, with just about everything anyone ordered at the table as the dipping utensil, as well as forcing the ever-attentive busboys to leave the plate of hummus there until every last morsel was devoured, so it's gotta be delicious, right? 

I am actually a huge fan of the Dark Horse and, regardless of yelp Quizzo, am pretty sure I will be frequenting it whenever I'm in the neighborhood (and yay! I have a cousin at 5th and south, so it could be pretty often!)...",2011-07-03 03:39:25
Abs7Uy3RxK9hlWpZsl8S6Q,WaX5rCOD6UFIPHALwugTHw,LpIKjMR5ERpyzEN1tbf3fw,5.0,1,0,1,"Why is there only one review on here so far and only a week away?  Is this place really that new?  

I wanted to try this place because:

1. I saw the Peruvian food sign
2.  They are trying to sell Peruvian food under the name "". . . New York Deli""
3.  Just by the first time, I was guessing it might be a gem since it's in such an unassuming place.
4.  It's as if the previous? owners used the same name, but had a typical sandwich/hoagie joint.
5.  nearby Inka Wall in Upper Darby was a Peruvian restaurant with bar and even a stage and a Peruvian shop, and it closed permanently
6.  When I was headed on my way there on the first visit, I got State Rd. mixed up with Garrett Rd. as I wanted to go by my geographic ""memory"".  So, once I realized I messed up, maybe a dash of ""FOMO"", and because an order was already put in, then of course I re-directed myself to the right place.

I technically made 3 trips to this place with 2 intended.
The first visit, they didn't have the alfajores arrive yet.  I picked up my noodles, a flan, and this purple chicha drink which reminded me of a purple drink I had when I was in Peru.  It was similar here but in a bottle and it was made of maize or corn, which I knew was comparable to what I had in Peru.

Then, I re-visited the place at night for the alfajore (cookie with peanut butter in-between).  I liked the alfajore, but I would've preferred a raspberry or blueberry filling, but maybe that would be americanizing it too much.  Kind of like how I get slightly perturbed when people rave to me about philly steak sushi is one of the greatest sushis they've ever had with that implied unawareness that they don't know how to appreciate what else is really out there, lol.

On another day, I was craving for more.  So I ordered, not 1, but 2 entrees (lol)- fried fish fillets with fried rice  and also steak with egg, rice, and fried plantains.  It took me 4 meals to finish everything.  I don't remember which item came with a side salad.  On this visit, they had their drink machines running.  I'm guessing they do this only on the weekends and maybe Friday.  They had a brown colored drink, a white drink, and a purple drink that they told me is not the same as the chicha in a bottle.  I liked all of them and they let me sample all of them too.  I wanted to go with all three of them, but I figured I'd just keep it at one for now, lol.

The prior reviewer mentioned how there is a heavy Asian influence on Peruvian food, which makes sense.  There was a time when a significant number of Japanese immigrated to Peru.  In certain communities, the population of Japanese is about 33% of the entire community I believe.  There was also a wave of Chinese immigrants later on after that.

There are only five reviews of this place on GrubHub and since August 27. So, this change or place must be recent- like within a month or two.
Look like the chicken might be too dry- that is something I didn't have from this place.",2021-10-14 21:07:10
dNER3LXOGnkP1nW4uvlEuw,WDX_KkxwI8VYOF3RHpNLpA,aa_XL0aU1QSWN4hPd7FhYg,2.0,3,0,0,"Ok. I have been here twice now and let's just say it's a really good thing that this last time wasn't my first. I would not have returned would it have gone the other way. 

Both times I ordered the Acai Blueberry Smoothie Bowl (which is honestly more like a smoothie parfait) minus the banana and adding hemp hearts and chia seeds. The first one is in the picture. There are layers, it's nice and neat (not literally over-flowing), and it was fully mixed (no big chunk the diameter of the cup near the bottom). Also, they had the hemp hearts the first day. It was definitely yummy enough to hit the spot when I was craving a smoothie bowl (the first time), but didn't have time to go to the other side of town where they make some smoothie bowls to die for.  Yummy enough to return and take my son with me.

We walk in and are immediately told that they can't take our order until they finish the one they are working on. I look down and the entire counter is filled with 4-drink drink carriers of smoothies. I asked are we looking at something like 5 minutes or 30. She said she didn't know. I later discover that these two young ladies sitting down are also waiting to order. This 30+ smoothie order (might have had more, but I know they counted out 30 straws) had been called in and the three employees were all working on this and using all of the blenders. I think it would have been much wiser to have one employee take care of the customers in the shop (who's orders were actually quite quick for them to assemble later).

I finally get to order and they don't have the hemp seeds. Well, ok. That happens. I had the 10% off deal for checking in with Yelp, but they couldn't figure out how to give it to me even though they already hit the ""use now"" button (so I had to use it within a couple of minutes... not next time or whatever). Another girl took over and then joked that we will have to wait four hours before we can use the code. Ya, not funny when we had already been there about a half hour... When we get our smoothie bowls, I had to get the first girl's attention just to get some spoons. Mine was over-flowing and not in a good way. Honey and smoothie covered chia seeds were going all down the sides. It didn't seem as thick this time and when I got down near the bottom, I discovered a frozen disk probably about 1/3 inch thick and diameter of the cup. It didn't have much flavor on it's own, either. I also discovered when I saw my picture of the first time again that my second one didn't have the layers of goodies. My son liked his, but wasn't happy about the such long wait that made us late to our destination.

This could easily go up in stars if I decide to chance it again and they do more like they did the first time. They have a lot of potential; they just didn't live up to it on this last Wednesday.",2018-08-18 02:29:16
YxqlbGnAnGEaQc3qqUCW4w,h1cyt9MTy19RPbgn8VVjcg,4SRl5od0lY33oK1GMbA23A,5.0,4,0,2,"Beautiful farm-to-table restaurant with a menu that changes nightly. My husband and I were visiting from NY and read amazing things about this restaurant, so we decided to give it a try while in town. Our server was Jessica, and she was attentive and informative. The restaurant is in a beautiful old house, and my husband and I sat on the covered veranda. It had an old charm, and the interior of the restaurant was modern in comparison. All the food is farm-to-table (you can see their garden near the parking lot) and their menu is southern with a twist.

For cocktails, I ordered the Pins and Needles -- a delicious mezcal drink that was light and refreshing for summer, with a yummy smoke to it. My husband ordered the Post Melone, which had a unique floral Chilean liquor - definitely a unique dink with floral notes.

Appetizers: We ordered the oysters (it came with 5) that had a lemon sorbet on top with an edible marigold flower from the garden. Delicious. We also ordered the housemade pimento that was served with 3 Johnny Cakes. I think there was too much cheese for the amount of Johnny Cakes - a little less cheese on the plate would have been perfect since we had a lot left over, although Jessica did offer to give us a 4th cake if we wanted to finish the cheese. A good dish, a little on the heavier side for me, but done very well. 

Entrees: I ordered the shrimp and grits, which was delicious - I loved the addition of green chili and cilantro. My husband ordered the beef, which was served with a buckwheat crepe and mushrooms. A smaller portion of beef than he'd usually  eat, but it was grilled nicely for a nice crust, and was medium rare in the middle. Cooked really well. 

Dessert: We were so intrigued by the sundae because it was pink peppercorn ice cream and banana ice cream. Both were so yummy!

We each ordered an apertif with dessert: I have a favorite amaro (Cardamaro), which they had on the menu, but they also had a LONG list of amaro choices, so I felt like trying something new. It's rare that you find a restaurant with amaro on the menu, let alone so many choices. I told Jessica my usual favorite and she spoke to the bartender about what might be a similar one for me to try. She brought out a Forthave Marseilles from Brooklyn that was awesome. My husband tried a coffee-flavored one that was also tasty. 

Great service, and they didn't rush us out, which was so nice on such a gorgeous, cool July day. We were there for 2 hours!  I'd highly recommend visiting Husk.",2021-07-04 04:17:35

When we first walked in there was a group of people waiting by the counter at the door, and it was unclear if you were supposed to wait to be seated, or go somewhere to order, or how things worked. There wasn't clear signage by the door and rather than the owner/employees telling us where to go, they just glared at us. Then I heard the owner (loudly) tell his employee ""go tell those people to move or get out"". 

He pointed us in the direction of the counter where we would order. We went there the girl taking orders was reluctant to take our order because she said they might be shutting down the kitchen because they were overwhelmed with orders. She ended up taking our order anyway. We knew it would be a bit before we got our food and we were fine with that because we had all seen the great reviews. It actually didn't take as long as we were anticipating to get our pizzas... maybe 35 minutes or less. When they called my name, I went up to grab my pizza, I saw my dads name on the pizza next to mine and he came to get it. One of the guys making the pizzas was super rude and said ""I CALED YOUR NAME 10 TIMES!! TEN TIMES I CALED YOU AND YOU NEVER CAME!!"" My dad just said ""okay"" and walked away. 

All of that being said, the pizza was great. Dispute the fact that mine was pretty burnt (see the pic) we all agreed that it was the best out of all the pizzas we got. We just broke off the burnt pieces and ate around it. It was a little upsetting after paying over $20 to get the pizza this way, but I was so uncomfortable that I decided not to complain. 

While we were eating we heard the owner complaining to people about how a video went viral on the internet and ever since business has exploded. I understand that they were under a lot of stress and were trying to keep up, but it was a very uncomfortable experience and environment. I would give a 0/5 for customer service and environment and a 4/5 for the food... so I guess my advice would be to order to go!",2020-08-17 01:54:52

I'm not writing this review out of spite, I just don't want anyone else to make the same mistake. tropicana gardens takes you on a tour of the room that they actively update and deep clean. My room looks like it hasn't been deep cleaned in 5 years. the bathroom is disgusting. The overflow holes in the sink are clogged with unknown green stuff, there is mold and calcium build up like none other. It's terrible. There is no air conditioning and I thought I was going to die of heat exhaustion because it was so hot. There aren't even ceiling fans.I am also on the bottom floor which is said to be the nicest rooms, so I can't even imagine the upper floor rooms. And don't get me started on the food. Its flat out gross. sometimes there a little surprise and its delicious, like the fish tacos, the burrito bar, the pulled pork sandwiches, the quesadilla bar and the cookies. But it might just be good because I'm a hungry college student. There is zero nutrition I have noticed health declines in myself and my roommates. The food is a mystery. Anyways I know that ""this isn't meant to be a five star hotel,"" but I am paying the prices of one. My bathroom light is being held up by duck tape. The bathroom in my suit flooded and the floors that were completely underwater still haven't been replaced. And when I sent a message to the ""front desk"" they replied with I'm so sorry about your unfortunate circumstances we will put in a new maintenance request and get those things fixed. The flood happened September 10th And I'm sure you can guess, it still haven't been fixed. I'm so tired of all the lying from the staff. This place feels like a jail and high school all mixed in one. Parents for the love of God do not am your children to live here. 

Thanks so much Dave for getting back to me. I appreciate you for not addressing anything important that I discussed in my review and once again posting another almost pre written response. Brushing things under the rug won't make anything go away, and that's Tropicana's favorite pastime. In the time that you responded to now, none of the things I've discussed that you said would get taken care of have been taken care of. My light still being held up by duct tape. The floors are still there from the flood and now our front door comes unlocked sometimes which is a major safety hazard. Oh and I also have been harassed by your ""lovely"" staff members. Another thing because of the flood in my suite, black mold went everywhere in my apartment and caused me and my roommates to become ill, since the another residents pipes exploded and the same mold went everywhere in their room. There is visible water damage everywhere in the building, that is no joking matter that is a safety hazard. I'm tired of being put in the back burner. I have sent many emails and have been told that things would get taken care of. Stop being cheap because for the prices I'm paying I Know you aren't hurting for money. This place is the most over priced lie I have ever gotten myself into. I was promised many things that have not been delivered. That's false advertisement sir.

I purchased a 2015 Hyundai Elantra from Carvana in early February. The steering wheel was off-center, so I made an appointment with Hyundai of Cool Springs for diagnostics. I won't go into too much detail about the poor service I've received the 3 times I've been to that dealership -- they're a separate business and it's a long story. After horrible service in Cool Springs, I picked up my vehicle and realized that the problem was NOT fixed -- they hadn't run diagnostics, they'd just centered the steering wheel and moved along. Only problem? The steering wheel WASN'T entirely centered -- it was pulling slightly to the left now.

My warranty company, Silver Rock, told me that I now needed to visit a different in-network repair facility. This is where Downtown Hyundai comes in -- they're a 20 minute drive, but the closest dealership when you ignore Cool Springs. I dropped the car off at 7AM on a Friday and had heard back from my service adviser, Ashley, by around 11AM -- they had discovered that my car (with just over 12,000 miles on it) had been sold to me with a bent strut on the driver's side, which was causing the crooked steering wheel. Silver Rock had requested photos, which had been sent, but not reviewed by the claims adjuster yet. By 3PM, I called Silver Rock myself to complain that my car had been in the shop for 8 hours waiting on a decision to be made. Within the next hour, Silver Rock had called Downtown Hyundai to let them know that their limited warranty, the manufacturer's warranty, AND my power train warranty all would not be covering the repairs, as they were a suspension issue that was caused by a previous owner and it had not come from the manufacturer defected. Ashley called to give me the bad news, but told me that they had re-aligned my vehicle for me free of charge in the hopes that it would help with the steering as I waited to be able to afford the nearly $500 repair to my vehicle.

I spent the next two hours on the phone with Carvana, the dealer that had sold me the car, explaining (in tears) how unfair the situation was and how disappointed I was. Ashley had sent me the photos of the bent strut so that I could provide them to anyone that asked -- long story short, I was able to convince Carvana to override the denial of coverage from Silver Rock and pay for the repairs. It was so late in the day by this point that the parts weren't going to be able to be ordered until next week, so I picked up my vehicle and will be returning for repairs mid-week next week.

I am floored by the kind and supportive service team at Downtown Hyundai. I nearly cried just because they were all so kind to me, and Ashley was sure to double-check my vehicle for any grease or boot marks when I picked it up (Hyundai of Cool Springs left grease smeared all over my driver's door, leather, and boot marks on the door from kicking it open from the inside). I did not catch the name of the gentleman driving the shuttle that morning, but would like to say that he was also kind and dealt with exasperated older customers very well (there were a couple of them in the lobby -- it was nearly 8AM on a weekday and I'm sure they were annoyed that they couldn't get themselves to work on their own).

I hope that my good experiences with this dealership continue so that I can continue to leave glowing reviews for them. I also called this morning to make sure that the service manager, Bill, knows how pleased I am.

Thank you for such great service!",2018-04-07 15:47:19
VusJENnBjhlRs_EwVbzV1Q,W72SJOLxKKzoyx_MnxMDYg,nacZN6uLW2mz4S_khfh7ZQ,1.0,2,1,0,"I have unfortunately had way too many atrocious experiences with this local HVAC company. Last fall, we replaced our entire HVAC system with Goodman A/C and gas forced hot air furnace from T.S. Heating & Cooling in Norristown, PA. The initial install was never completed as promised and we could not get the owner, Tom, to return to complete his work. We were also fairly certain that the install was done incorrectly. We spent months working our way up the corporate food chain at Goodman's Corporate Headquarters in Texas with our complaints and demands to have one of their company engineers come to our home to review the work Tom had done. Tom only came to the table when we pulled our full purchase price out of his bank account without notice (twice) and refused to give it back until the work was completed per Goodman's specifications appropriate for our home which was not the way Tom had installed it.

This past week, we paid a private energy consulting firm recommended by PECO Energy to perform an audit of our home after having completed replacement of all of the windows in our home with newer, more energy efficient windows. We questioned whether we were experiencing a lot of cold air infiltration into our home after our first winter with the new windows in place. During that inspection, all of our energy consuming appliances were also evaluated as part of the full energy audit. You can imagine our surprise when the person performing the audit detected leaks in the metal piping modified by Tom (owner of T.S. Heating & Cooling) during the new furnace installation. PECO Emergency Services had to be called and they rushed out to shut the gas off in our house while PECO verified the existence and location of the gas leaks and repaired one of them. PECO then advised that I needed to call the installer to repair the second gas leak because they were not authorized to fix the second leak for some reason. (What a potentially dangerous and explosive situation!). I called TSH&C and spoke directly with Jerry (Tom's sales person) and explained the urgent situation which required Tom's immediate attention per PECO. Jerry said he would contact Tom immediately. Four days have now passed and we still have not had any response from Tom about fixing his dangerous, faulty installation problem. We reached out to the Goodman management people with whom we had dealt previously to resolve issues with Tom and T.S. Heating & Cooling, but even that has not produced a response from Tom. All that Goodman would due is assure us that Tom and T.S. Heating & Cooling would be severely ""sanctioned"" by Goodman, but they would not divulge how. All they would do for us is provide us with the website for us to look up other area Goodman authorized dealers who would honor all of our equipment and service warranty contracts with Goodman. They said it would represent a ""conflict of interest"" to give us a referral to one of them to quickly resolve our dangerous gas leak issue. I guess their ""conflict of interest"" is not as important as the concern that our home, as well as those of our neighbors, could all be blown up ... we live in a townhome community. Get the picture?

If I could give this HVAC company (TSH&C) a negative star rating I would. Their lack of professionalism, ethics and scruples is far beyond comprehension. I don't know how Tom can sleep or look at himself in the mirror each day knowing how shameful and incompetent a business organization he operates. Considering Goodman's response to standing up for the health and safety of their customers, I would give them as equally low a rating and suggest that people always choose more reputable companies in the HVAC industry, of which there are many.",2017-04-18 00:31:54

So I did. Twice.

First time was so busy I figured it must have been off the hook
Nope. It's hype.  I didn't yelp time #1 because I felt biased based on the ""discovery.""  Nothing stood out except a bil under $22for 3 well portioned rice plates.  Cheap doesn't always equate to good.

Forget Sacramento. Ever been to San Jose or Mt. View, CA? Now we're talking gooood Vietnamese where Vietnamese people actually go!!! Pho (pronounced ""fah"") though nobody in St Louis believed me! So we'll emphasize the ""o"" to sound like a local. 

2nd time- PhOO Grand is ok if you want a cheap bowl of vermicelli noodles & mediocre quality meat.  It's a good place to people watch because trust me, if your group is not ""you all there?"" you WILL be waiting by the door til you friend arrives (yes, 2 of us...party of 2 & still couldn't get a table. I get it, though. Sort of....
 They're all about flipping tables during lunch. However, this time wasn't sardine packed. 
 I met my dear friend there who was this Greek (enough said if you know Any Greeks) lady who could never be punctual. For 30 minutes I patiently observed, checked my email, texted, occasionally looked at the lady up front with eyes that read ""really?""  I coyly smirked when my (late) friend arrived. I told her that I couldn't even sit on one of the open tables. She replied ""oh I know, they're totally like that here."" WTF chuck? !
.. but I digress...

Food wasn't too exciting. Bun dish (vermicelli with shrimp since they wouldn't do it with chicken ) was bland.  When its 105 out, normal people dont do hot soup. Their curry noodles were decent. The spring rolls were too oily. Service was a 3 (our server was so prompt, imagine that!!) Food was a 2. I rounded down. How would anyone give a 5? Wow. And from those who claim to travel??? Eeek.
Maybe I needed to stick strictly with Pho.   

Sorry but if you're visiting St Louis and there's plenty of food options,  don't do Vietnamese. If you must, Meikong on the next corner is all over this place in terms of quality (minus the hype, little waiting, weird staff though. Be warned.)

My opionion, there's not a large enough Vietnamese community in St Louis for this joint to be accountable for really good Vietnamese good (which it's not)...
it caters to an unexposed under-traveled clientele of folk who are excited about some culture in stl. Heck, if I was born & raised in St. Louis, I'd think phO grand was grand too. It's like thinking Chevy's really is authentic Mexican. 

I asked my nail salon Guy (super cool Vietnamese American) ""Where is there good boon & pho?""He replied, ""We eat at home. Not pho grand.""
When I expressed my opinion which resonates much of this review, he laughed and said ""You get it !""  Then he offered me a free nail design.
Woo hoo.

First off, the parking alone was $30 and to get to your room, you have through this weird stairs and hallway that's open to non-residents and extremely creepy. As a woman, this is a huge red flag when I first arrive to a hotel. 

When entering the hallways to get to your room you are overcome with gloom because of the dimness and depressing color scheme. I got the immediate feeling of... what the hell did I just pay for... also, it smells like a mix of old meatloaf and pennies. Yum! 

The rooms are just awkward. It is almost as if they chose random decor from an expired Kohl's catalog and called it a day. To put it simply, the color pallet as well as the choice of furniture is nauseating. Additionally, it's a bunch of empty space and awkward dimensions. It's unsettling... At this point of my experience, I just thought i was being too critical and finished unloading my stuff. 

AND THEN, the turning point of my stay and the spawn of this nasty Yelp review. This room was disgusting, the carpet looked as if it hadn't been vacuumed in a month with food, and dog kibble, all over the floor. But folks, here is my favorite part- there were RAT DROPPINGS on the floor, or whatever the hell were these tiny brown balls were,  (pictured below for your viewing pleasure ). Isn't that just lovely? And if it couldn't get any worse, there was CHEWED GUM on the top of the cap of the water bottle that you can purchase for an ungodly price. (Also below!) What the hell man. Disgusting. Why? Why? 

At this point, it was just comical at how much they f**cked up with this hotel room. How does this hotel stay in business? Look at the other reviews and you will find other experiences that bring up the same stuff and some other things I don't mention here (like the way they catfish this hotel online, the price, how they double charge you, etc). Oh and by the way, even the wifi is sketchy, my MacBook gave me a security warning upon first connecting to it. I immediately disconnected from it when the image below popped up. 

My family and I immediately checked out and thankfully, they gave us our money back with no problems. I will be closely monitoring my bank statements however. 

So overall, a great place to stay if you are having a mid life crisis and want to be overcome with gloom and the smell of pennies. Thanks!",2021-06-15 23:01:26

But when I got there, I noticed something.  One of my favorite Indian places in the area is Himalayan in Malvern, and when I walked in I started to notice some similarities.  When I got to the buffet, I noticed some similar dishes.  We asked the lady who greeted us at the door, and it turns out that this place is owned by the same family, and the same chef's recipes were being used.  Well, this made me incredibly happy to begin with.  So I set about to see whether or not this place met the same standards food-wise. 

Pretty much across the board, it was right there.  In a couple of cases, I might even say some of the food was better.  Right off the bat, I saw they had my favorite Gobi Manchurian on the buffet which I made it a point to recommend to everyone in our party of 9.  It was a hit with everyone, especially my wife, and made the exact same way as in Malvern.  Perfect!

The chicken dishes had a lot of the same flavor that their Malvern counterparts have, which is a good thing.  Their Tandoori Chicken has a little more kick to it here which I liked a lot.  Everything across the board had the perfect amount of spice.  I sampled three different chicken dishes and found them to be on par with the best of anything I've had in the area.  Their samosas also had an added kick to them which worked out perfectly.  

One more plus was dosa on the buffet.  You don't find enough dosa in this area.  But it was just basic dosa, and it was sitting out on the buffet.  This made the dosa not the best it could be, but I still liked it.  I just liked having the option of having it there.  

The one thing that has always set Himalayan in Malvern out to me has been the friendliness of the staff.  Well, it carries over to here.  Our party was celebrating two birthdays at once including my wife.  When the lady who was managing the room heard about this, she returned later with birthday cards for each of the birthday guests with personal greetings written in them.  A very nice touch that was appreciated.  

For $9 a person on a weekend lunch buffet, that can not be beat at all.  And they pleased the entire party I was with, all of whom were much more experts on Indian cuisine than I ever could be.  Heck, most of them grew up with the cuisine where I came to it late.  So their happiness tells me much more. 

If I gave Himalayan in Malvern 5 stars, I have to say the same about Jas Himalayan.  It's a hidden gem in Exton.",2012-02-12 20:30:22

The lighting is a bit dim which offers a more intimate setting. Dress is casual, however, there were plenty of people who opted for
more formal attire. Boulevard American Bistro was the perfect lunch/brunch place on a holiday weekend where many places are typically booked and no longer taking reservations.

I made reservations which weren't required , but suggested. Every host/hostess greeted me upon entrance. It was nice to be acknowledged by all. I was seating immediately and provided with menus. My waitress was very attentive and not overbearing, i enjoyed having her and it seemed like that was the standard from each waiter/waitress which is an added plus. 

For starters I had the bbq shrimp. With this being a favorite of mine, I haven't been to many places who hit the mark. I must say this appetizer was perfect, the sauce, shrimp, and bread. Perfect portions, and the taste just right. If there was anything I would've changed, I would've preferred the dish be hot on arrival to the table. Tasted so good, I forgot to capture a picture. 

Now on to the meal. Crab cakes can easily be the best or worst option on any menu, so I choose to order with caution at any restaurant. Currently I'd rank this as number 3 on my list of restaurants with best crab cakes. The crack cakes have the perfect crust on the outside and were nicely pan seared. Very large crab cakes, a bit creamy on the inside, no filler is perfect. Nothing but crabmeat. I'm not quite sure what was missing, maybe a seasoning of some sort, but there was something that I couldn't quite put my finger on. I would recommend more of the Dijon sauce which was the perfect accompaniment, just not enough. The two large crab cakes at market price are def worth a try. Had enough to take a crab cake to go and enjoy it with a salad the following day. 

The black beans and rice were perfectly seasoned and who doesn't love carbs? I'd order that as a side to go if I'm looking for a quick bite to eat.

Overall, this restaurant provided a nice experience and if I were in the area and look for a nice lunch or early dinner I would definitely stop by.",2021-12-26 16:00:45

The rooms and the food were very nice. The facility is relatively small which is an advantage in my mind. The space allows the residents to easily get around with a library and multiple sitting areas. The outdoor space is excellent with a beautiful rose garden. However it was clear from my very first tour with Mary Hall-Smith that Willow Park was about people. Unlike other facilities, Mary introduced me to both residents and staff and let those conversations be my guide on whether this was the right place to bring my mom. She was, at the time, in the early stages of dementia and could no longer safely care for herself at home. 

One of the unique programs at Willow Park is the amazing Bridges program, for people in early stages of dementia, who would likely need Memory Care in the future. In all of the places that I looked, (~ 10), nobody offered or mentioned such a dynamic and practical pre-memory care program. Monica is the heart and sole of the program. When the time came for her to move into Memory Care, Monica and Zach prepared us for event and let us know what to expect and how to deal with my Mom's questions and adjustment.

Memory Care was the saddest day of my life, however, the staff proved to me that she would be safe and well cared for. More than that, they became her friends and family. I visited 3+ times a week, but I could spend time with her and didn't need to worry about other issues.  If I thought she needed something, it was all quickly taken care of from her medicine, food preferences (ice cream) and entertainment.  If I asked questions they knew the answers or would find out by the time I left. Aaron, Linda and Albina should be complimented for leading such a great team in a difficult situation.

Most importantly, was the humanity exhibited not only during her final weeks, but also over her entire two years in Memory Care. After she was placed on comfort measures by the hospice team, the staff helped maintain her dignity and looked after her. We got a sense that they truly knew, cared for and loved her as a human being and not just a ""resident."" As I was saying goodbye to her, it was clear the staff was saying goodbye to her as well. Over her last days they took impeccable care of my Mother and our family.  Many thanks to all of the other exceptional people who took the time to know Alice, feed her, keep her safe and truly give her dignity at a time when she was so vulnerable, we compliment Willow Park and their truly wonderful staff, praise you and thank you from the bottom of our hearts.",2020-05-11 18:18:12

Ive been going to the location in Broomall for the past several months so naturally, I was very excited when I got that email saying that the location was open, less than 5 mins from my house!

I went during their preview week where they offered free 30 min services to current customers, family and friends. This alone was a plus because who doesn't like free? I think they opened on Friday and I set my appointment on Saturday morning (just so that I wasn't the first batch of customers they were receiving). Walking into the store, it was complete chaos. The receptionists were actively being trained by managers in the waiting room. I wasn't really a fan of that because it made me feel like the location was unprepared for the opening. 

My appointment was at 930 and I was taken back into the waxing room by 935. The wax specialist was very nice and welcoming, I felt comfortable being with her but I could tell she was very new. I even asked if this is her first gig because I could just tell. There were a few times where the wax wasn't dry when she was going to pull it and it really irritated by skin because it was getting pulled at unnecessarily. I was surprised to find out that all of the waxers at the Bala are completely new hires of EWC. It seems a little weird that the company wouldn't want some experienced EWCer's in the mix to help the location during the beginning phases. 

The overall service took over 40 minds and during my wax she was getting paged for the next client- she left in the middle of my session which I thought was very unprofessional. While checking out, it was still actively loud in the waiting room full of the chaos I was greeted when I first walked in. The young lady that was checking me out was running through the general checkout lines. When I told her I'll call in to make another appointment because I already have an appointment with my other location set (and honestly at that point I already decided I probably will stick to my other location for now) she gave me a really snooty look and snapped her lips at me! How rude!! With that I left with a very sour taste in my mouth from the whole experience. 

I understand that new locations always have their own kinks to work out but until I see some better reviews on this location I'm going to keep driving my 30 some miles away to get the  quality of service I pay for.",2016-02-18 17:19:59

Starting with the staff who is extremely unprofessional and not welcoming. First off I went to this place years ago under different owners , I would think that these reviews were posted before the new management came in. I make an appointment  over lunch time which I am already in a time crunch to begin with, so upon walking in they hand me the stack of paperwork. Mind you I have gone to these places all over the country so not my first rodeo on how things work. So I fill out the info hand it back and I get oh you aren't going to provide your address? I say no and the answer I got was well we wont mail you anything. She then proceeds to get the medical director this is where knowing how to deal with people would come in. So she comes out and explains we are medical facility umm ok.... therefore, we need your address and you to fill out all the other info. So I put the address on there and guess what there was nothing else they needed I filled it all out already! Mind you I am not having anything big done either it was merely a 15 min appointment. Should have stopped there but did it no. They call me back and the girl in the room proceeds to interrogate me some more. Well I understand you had some issues with filling paperwork and not wanting to provide your address. You have got to be kidding me so now the whole office has been talking behind closed doors?!! Talk about tacky and unprofessional. Typically the workers do no know about paperwork issues but clearly this is a poorly run office. Not to mention its so outdated the décor and place itself needs a facelift! Back to the issue so now after poking at me again about the address and not being friendly and polite she says are we all clear with everything. Unbelievable, you should not be asking me this but should be focused on the task and reason why I am there which is to get a service!  So after irritating me some more making me feel awful, leaving me in tears , she steps out and comes back well I don't think we are on the same page we aren't going to work on you. Are you kidding me of all the places I have been for services I have never been treated this way and felt like I was in such a catty high school. The whole thing is that makes it even worse is that another family member goes there who was going to go back regularly. They now lost both of us sad thing is they don't care. There's too many good places out there that are polite and caring to waste money at this outdated place with a poor staff.",2016-08-19 17:39:21

If you have never been to Fogo or Chima in Philly then you will probably like it here. The concept is fun and different. You get an unlimited amount of Rotisserie meats, Salad bar and Appetizers for about $32pp which isn't bad. The steaks are pretty good some better than others. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the pineapple was sweet and went great with the Ham! There were a few servers who went out of their way to make it a nice experience by making sure certain cuts of meat were brought to our table. The actual restaurant and decor is nice. Its located in the new complex at The Voorhees Town Center which means no parking fees and no toll to Philly!
Now, if you have been to Chima or especially Fogo in Philly? You will notice a huge difference in quality, service and attention!! There's a reason for the $20pp price difference. The salad bar at Fogo is top notch with cured meats, cheeses, fresh vegetables, fruits....its a meal in itself. They have since added a hot bar. When you first enter the restaurant its amazing and beautiful! As soon as you're seated you get your water glasses filled, your drink orders placed, and your hot side dishes on the table. The cheese bread is one of the reasons why I come here.  As soon as you turn your coasters to the green side, within minutes your plate will be full of there filet mignon, garlic pichana, lamb, ribs, chicken, ribeye, sausage... Beautifully cooked to perfection! You will never have to wait for your drink to be replenished, your plate removed and replaced with a clean one, or wait for any goucho to bring over a squewer of grilled meat. The entire staff anticipates your needs. 
So finally, if you're looking for top notch food and service go to Fogo! Yes its about $55pp for the main meal not including drinks, desserts, tip, parking and toll but if you go to Ruths Chris or The Palm for a steak dinner? You're paying about the same price and at Fogo you get a variety and endless amount. Its worth it!!
But if you want the experience of a Brazilian style restaurant and don't want to spend that much money or go to Philly go here. But just expect slower service, average salad bar and sides, servers that are still learning their craft (we had sausage fall on the floor, ham fall on the table...) and worst of all a long wait for meat to be available! At one time a 13min wait at dinner time and we were in the center aisle of the restaurant visibly waiting with dirty plates pushed to the side and green side up! We saw our waitress once in 2hours!!
I would only go again during lunch and if someone else wanted to try it. I gave it 3starsfor the restaurant itself but if it was comparing it to Fogo I would have given it a 2star",2013-05-29 17:02:11

We got an estimate for putting new hardwood down in our house and refinishing some existing hardwood. For new hardwood (product plus installation), Bell was almost twice the cost of the other guys (who ended up doing a fantastic job with the new wood), so I was glad I got more than one estimate. Ed, the installation manager, is very friendly and knowledgeable and pretty responsive, though we did run into some communication issues with him (see below). We ended up using Bell for refinishing the floors in 2 rooms of our  75+ year old house (sanding and staining) since the other company did not do sanding and refinishing. I felt like Bell was probably overpriced but we were sick of getting estimates for various things in our new house so we didn't have a comparison price for this job. 

The main issue I had with Bell is that they sent random contractors from out in the burbs near where we live. We had no idea contractors would be coming; we had chosen Bell because they are a bigger company (all things considered) that represented to us that they have their own employees and installation team. It probably would not have even mattered, in fact, if we had not run into problems. The Friday after Thanksgiving, while we were out of town, I got a call from an unknown person saying work men were at our house and could not get in.  We had not scheduled anyone for that day, so I was totally surprised. I told the caller that we could ""re""schedule for Monday morning at 9 am and called to confirm with Bell. The contractors did not show up Monday as scheduled. I had taken the morning off work and waited around for several hours, and they didn't come. I made numerous phone calls to and left several voice messages for Bell (since I thought it was Bell who would handle scheduling and I had no way to reach the contractors/work people). Long story short....we rescheduled AGAIN for the NEXT day and they promised (through Bell) they would be there on time. We almost called it quits due to frustration, but they did end up finally coming and did a satisfactory job. The floors were messy and smelly, but this was to be expected. They look great and we are happy with the outcome. However, I would not recommend them due to the problems we had with timeliness/scheduling.",2016-02-04 04:08:56

They offer other services I've never used- apparently there is a sleep medicine center, a cancer center, doctors and physical therapists, diabetes management, and more. But this review is just for the laboratory and imaging services.

The building is somewhat hidden, and it was confusing the first time I came here. After you turn off of West Chester Pike, drive farther than you expect, then turn left. The parking lot is actually behind the second building. It's easy once you have figured it out, but the first time you go, leave an extra 5 minutes just in case. Parking is convenient- their lot is huge, and it never seems that busy.

From the parking lot, there is a door to the cancer center or to the rest of the building. For the laboratory and imaging, you go into the rest of the building and into a room on your left. The women who check you in always seem a bit frazzled, and they have you drop off your insurance card, license, and script with them, and then tell you to head to a handful of computers to do the rest of your check-in yourself (which I actually like, but some of the other clients seem to have problems). I have seen them ask the older clients if they expect they will need help with the computer, and will go over and help them check-in if needed. Also, you don't need an appointment for laboratory services.

I've waited anywhere from 5 minutes to 1.5 hours to get taken back. Apparently the time of day matters- go a bit later to avoid the fasting blood draws. Once taken back, the blood draws take just a few minutes, and everybody has always been friendly and professional. When I got my ultrasound here, I was a little less comfortable- I didn't really know what to do (it was my first one) and the technician seemed annoyed that she had trouble getting a picture or two. She just mostly shouted words at me like ""BREATHE"" ""TURN"" ""STOP BREATHING"". It made the  experience a bit more stressful. That being said, she knew what she was doing (the doctor approved of the pictures) and she got me in and out fairly quickly. 

I'll probably keep going to Bryn Mawr Hospital Health Center because it's a convenient location and they're usually quick and professional. However, I had no idea this place existed until one of my parents had told me. Definitely a better choice than some of the other options out there for laboratory services!",2012-09-14 12:07:39
EXI9gS5vRqf_XNGR63SPMw,oeFiWvoOG0hpMOXXxblfyQ,dO7gWzCuW9ULb7P4Qd9SdQ,5.0,3,1,2,"Ben Thanh is currently my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the Tampa Bay area.  Mostly because I have yet to discover all of the treasures that the menu has to offer.  And, each time we visit, I try something new--- and it has been consistently delicious.  

Located in an outdated shopping center, down a road of old warehouses and strange apartment buildings, is a completely blacked-out storefront window with the small words ""Ben Thanh"" on the front.  This location is away from the Vietnamese Restaurant row in Pinellas Park, yet just around the corner from Halong Bay.  Since you cannot see inside the restaurant from the outside of the building, there is no telling what lies within before you open the door.  
When you do enter, you will get stared at by everyone in the place.  No avoiding it.
If there is a place to sit down, take a seat and let the food adventure begin...

I thought I knew what Vietnamese food was like until I went to Ben Thanh.  I thought that all places were the same and that each restaurant would always have the same dishes available, just in different qualities from place to place.  Ben Thanh proved me wrong.  

What is my favorite appetizer?  Well, it would be the Goi Cuon--- but, it is done quite differently.  There is a very thin slice of pork sausage as the meat component, and also a thin sliced chili pepper inside.  The taste is unexpected and phenomenal.  I really enjoy ordering just appetizers as my meal like the Bun Xeo and Chicken Salad.  Wrapping the crispy Bun Xeo in fresh lettuce leaves with mint starts my day off with a smile.  All of the produce is so fresh that you cannot go wrong with any of the dishes.  An early lunch/brunch from here does not make me feel weighed down, like some other places.

What is my favorite entree?  I have yet to find that out because I order something different and new each time I visit.  The most interesting is the BT version of Mi Quang, which is a wet noodle pork based dish covered in seafood and rice crackers.  

Dessert?  I usually will order the Che Ba Mau (mixed bean and jelly in coconut milk), or go to Seasons for shaved ice, or Thuy for bubble tea.

So, why only 4 stars instead of 5 stars?  It is a family owned and operated place, with what I would guess is a mother and son doing all of the prep-work and waiting tables.  The service is barely there, and I have often just been ignored until the waiter/waitress is done eating their lunch or finishing what they are doing to even look in my direction.  Normally, this sort of service does not bother me, but at Ben Thanh, it is to the point of being rude.

United Market is on the same road, so we usually stop there after lunch to get groceries for the rest of the week.

Now that the Ben Thanh secret is out, the service will probably get even worse.  Don't crowd the place, ok guise?",2012-12-23 12:05:51

A standard pressure test would have revealed the missed connection but this was not performed prior to walling up the new plumbing connections. Fast forward to April 24th 2016 a slow water leak was discovered on a supply line of the newer plumbing. (less than 3 years old)
A licensed plumber was called to fix the leak. He found extensive damage to the subfloors, drywall and floor joists. The main beam and foundation blocks were sitting in several inches of water for an extended period of time. 
The joists wicked water well into two other rooms. The studs in both rooms wicked to over 24"" high on the walls. The office, bedroom and bath all ruined leaving us with a complete tear out of all work done on and prior to July 2013. We sustained level III damage to the entire south end of the house. 
Unique Home Solutions was contacted they responded by visiting my home. They surveyed the damage and verbally agreed damage is extensive and they would ""take care of it."" This statement was made numerous times by the head of bath division for Unique Home Solutions. The matter was then turned over to their insurance. 
After much time and worry I finally received a check that covers 60% of the damage to my house. Approximately 30% of my home is uninhabitable due to the water damage and now mold. So this single handicapped shower will cost me $20,000 out of pocket. It's a standard shower, nothing fancy or special about it. 
Unique Home Solutions has been contacted several times about this. A recent phone conversation yielded nothing after promising me a call back. 
If you have work done by this company:
- Insist on a pressure test for new plumbing, they do not have licensed plumbers on staff
- Make sure you read the back of contract as they have limiting liability statements
- Be very clear on what you want and what you don't want 
- There are NO GUARANTEES regardless what they state or advertise
- Record everything at all times so you can review it should it become necessary
Lastly know that your home insurance will not cover this. They consider mold gestation (2 weeks) long term and therefore maintenance. Unfortunately I cannot see through walls to know a leak existed. There was no spike in my water bill or other outward symptoms that would indicate this issue.
Based on the extent of damage, the time it took to get reasonable responses and inadequate compensation for the damage coupled with exorbitant repairs, I cannot recommend this company to anyone.",2016-07-26 02:14:25

As she spent numerous hours/days attending the convention and it's many sessions. I could not wait to find something fun to do with my wife outside of this convention for at least one evening out while at this never been to city. While speaking to some others also touring the city on a tour I went on earlier in the day, they were all planning a night out with there wives to see a show at a place called the Boom Boom Room. After listening in I was invited to join for a fun evening out as the evening show was ""THE GLAM GIRLS OF BURLESQUE"" which sounded like it could be the fun night out I was looking for with some great people. After getting lucky and reserving the last 2 seats available for the evening 10:30pm show, we headed on our way to the Boom Boom Room. Tickets were $25 a person. Upon arriving we were greeted with big smiles and very welcoming body language. We were promptly seated next to our new friends from the earlier city tour and offered our drinks (2 drink minimum which we didn't stop there).They have an option for dinner as well for an additional $30 per person but we opted out as we decided to have dinner prior to the show. The stage is in the middle of the club while the guests were seated around the stage at individual or group tables. Not the biggest venue but still comfortable. There were many small groups attending for bachelorette parties. The show turned out to be great! Definitely worth the money and having great company didn't hurt. The sound and light show were top notch, although I am still seeing spots to this day from being repeatedly blinded by the flashing lights. J/k. Ha, the blinding spots ended shortly after the show.
 As the show came to an end, the stage became a dance floor for all the guests to boogie down. Our group had a great time and thanks to Uber we were able to get back to the hotel safely with some great new made memories. We decided not to have a rental car for this trip so Uber was our best friend to get about the city during our stay. If you're ever visiting the St Louis Missouri area, I do recommend a night out at the Boom Boom Room for the Burlesque show. They do have other types of shows on the website for different seasons so feel free to browse as I believe they are now in the Christmas theme show month.",2017-11-29 17:07:08

Returned.  Didn't think it was worth it to keep.  

------

If I could, I would buy some clothes from Madewell.  But then again, you can find similar styles as well as quality for cheap elsewhere.  

I only came here to look at the bag selections.  There's currently a 25% off select bags sale, which is cool... but, of course, the bags are expensive.  After inspecting over five of the same bags, I settled on one of ""The Kensington Satchel"" in ""English Saddle"" with 25% off (read:  I love camel/cognac/tan bags).  I was, however, bummed that most of these bags had scuffs on the handles.  I pointed those out to the sales associate that day, but she said it's typical of leather bags.  

When I got home, I inspected some more and noticed scuff marks and other miscellaneous scratches on the corners and outside of the bag -- almost as if someone had already used the bag or it may be an older version of the bag that was on display.  Stopped by Madewell in KOP Mall and the same bags had a few to no scuffs, although the pebbled leather was a bit rough and wasn't as soft as the one I picked out. 

Went back to this store and showed more sales associates the scuffed corners, but they really couldn't do anything.  The only thing they could do was get another bag from the back, but they couldn't discount the price.  I mean, how can they sell bags that have scratches all over?  As I compared the same bags some more, the sales associates were speechless and I'm pretty sure they thought I was absolutely crazy.  In the end, I kept the bag.

On another note, I didn't notice the college discount until my boyfriend brought it to my attention.  Went back again with my student ID today and got 15% off, so I suppose I'm sort of okay with the final price.  I just hope the bag doesn't go on some super sale on Black Friday or in the coming weeks because I will not be happy, lol.

If you really like Madewell bags, definitely check them before you pay.  Most of the leather bags will easily scratch though, so unless you're okay with that or it's heavily discounted, don't buy the bags.  As for clothes and other accessories, wait for the sales, if you can, and don't forget your college ID for 15% off your purchases!",2013-11-26 02:36:10

Once, . after  waiting  an  endless  time  (  bad  bad  bad  slow   service)   there  was a    huge  roach(  beetle)   in my salad,  so  I  was  hesitant  to  buy  another  meal   but  wtf  it  WAS  my  b'day.  Tt  was  my  sixty  something  birthday,  I  had  a  plan,    El Saguaritos  or  Karaoke  and  dancing.  I  wanted  to  sing,  perform  cuz  it  makes  me  happy. I  entered  the  premises  and  the ** first !! thing  I  told  the  owner  was  it  was MY BIRTHDAY  and  Id  like  to  sing a  song  during  the  paid   folk  duet's  break.  He  asked  what  kind  and  I  said  ""  A  folk  song'    Me:""You  sure  You'll  let  me  sing  my  song  cuz  if  not  IL  bhit  a  karaoke  bar.""""

I'd  gotten  to  the  first  chorus  and a  man  with  a  peevish  angry  demeanor- the  HIRED folk  singer  comes  up  to  me,  grabs  the  mic,   and shouts  at  me""  You  can't  sing  the  owner  never  gave  you  permission.""

Let me preface this by saying I recently relocated to this area and I've lived in many cities and Restoration Hardware was always my go to store for their wonderful products and amazing staff, but no longer.  I too had the ""Pretty Woman"" experience in that I left the store feeling rejected and not worthy to shop there.  I felt the staff scanned and equated my casual style of t-shirt and jeans (with a Gucci purse, that they apparently missed) or maybe it was my older age, with someone that can't afford to make a purchase.  And, that WAS their big mistake as I walked out and promptly drove the next day to the highly reliable store, Ethan Allen, and made my purchases with Interior Designer, Alicia, who is highly knowledgeable, very helpful, gracious and was happy that I was there. (btw, I was still smarting from the experience at RH) 
At RH, the clerks passed me off like a bad penny and my daughters and I were continually in search of someone to help me and answer my questions regarding fabrics and sizes. Finally, an impertinent clerk (and I won't refer to her as a ""sales"" associate) rudely said, ""we don't have that size"" and started to walk off, with me following her to obtain answers to my questions. When I asked to see the velvet fabrics, she impatiently pointed and said, ""here, here, and here"", and once again tried to walk off again, with me inquiring to see an example. She then pointed across the room and said, ""by the lady in red"", leaving me wondering what lady and what various pieces she was referencing...And, then she was gone! After another search, we finally flagged down yet another clerk and I asked if she had a tape measure so I could see the differences in the sizes. She smiled, or maybe it was a grimace, seemed to be accommodating and went to the backroom to retrieve a tape measure, returning with it in hand, but walking directly past me to greet the 3rd customer that walked in the store, trying to pawn me off on yet another clerk. With this, and feeling despondent, I gathered my daughters and walked out. I won't be back...",2017-11-15 21:57:55

You pick your seafood, pay for it by the pound and take it to the cooking station where you get number tags for your goods. You wait for about an hour or more for the seafood to cook so make sure you head over get your raw stuff. Also, if you like the crab head, make sure you ask them to keep the head intact or they may only cut up the body for you.

I understand your job is to save face for the establishment but we both know that the info I provided is accurate. I would have respected an acknowledgement and apology for the situation being improperly handled. Your guard did repeatedly threaten my friend with the words ""I will knock you out."" You know that I was exiting the building behind both of them and I was not touched as she was. You also know my reasoning for holding on to the guard and railing was to restrain him from what looked like an impending attack on her. I even expressed this concern and told you that I did not want him to hurt her and that we were leaving. I am not sure what alcohol you are referring to as I didn't even have a chance to buy a drink before she was told to get out. I did not hear one applause or thanks from customers. What I saw were onlookers standing around, looking just as shocked as I was from your guard's choice of words. You still have not provided a reason why she was being kicked out nor do I care to hear one at this point. I have already shared my experience with the state's chapters of my alumni association and other affiliates and do not recommend them holding any events here in the future.


My friend and I visited this restaurant last weekend. Everything seemed to be fine after showing our IDs and walking into the establishment. About 5 minutes after, she was tapped on the shoulder and told ""BYE, GET OUT"" by the same bouncer who let us in. (pictured) I wasn't sure what she did as we were never given a reason why we needed to leave. Nonetheless, I followed her around to the exit. She asked the bouncer why she was being kicked out but he seemed pretty agitated with her question. That's when he began to walk up to her in a very threatening manner and repeatedly stated, ""I don't care if you're a female, I will knock you out!"" I was so shocked at the recklessness and unprofessionalism that was displayed by your employee. As he continued to threaten my friend, I grabbed him around the waist in an attempt to restrain him from hitting her. I continuously begged him not to hit my friend who only stands at 5 feet tall. Finally, another bouncer showed up and de-escalated the situation after I told him I did not want her to be attacked. I hesitated writing this review because I was still a little shaken from the whole ordeal. I've always had a wonderful time visiting New Orleans but this is no way to treat your patrons. My friends and family nor will I be visiting this particular restaurant. Saints and Sinners, you all have a serious problem that needs to be addressed. You are responsible for the safety of your customers. I highly encourage getting the proper training for your security guards before bad situations turn into worse. Until then, I refuse to spend my hard earned money at a business that blatantly promotes violence, especially violence against women.",2019-03-11 02:09:28
O2a6oYA7YlhtrcB-rJT9HA,go-wsxGUMiZAfGjd_WzI8w,ww3YJXu5c18aGZXWmm00qg,5.0,2,1,0,"One of the best restaurants, spots, places, houses, gardens, whatever-you-want in New Orleans!!
The food is superb! Top quality, an amazing service, great bar with Fernet! and the place is beauuuutiful!
What else can you ask?
Our waiter was super nice so he recommended a couple of dishes but we were pretty sure from the beginning what we liked.
To start the shrimp and grits that it was supposed to be one of the best in town and actually it is although I think it's a little bit overrated because it's a dish that in my humble opinion can't get any better than what it is already, but the sauce makes the difference with real corn on top. It's a starter and we shared it so it was a good size to have a little taste of it. I wouldn't order it next time.
The crab cake, well... let me tell you: THAT'S A SERIOUS CRABCAKE. The best I ever had is just an understatement. The chunks of lump crab are delicious and of course it has a killer seasoning typical from the creole/cajun cuisine. I would eat 3 of them! That's a MUST!
Then as an entrée we shared the cochon du lait sandwich that has that pulled pork you always dream of. Yes, cooked for 9 hours and marinated in the best flavor you can imagine. I would say it was a little bit too spicy/hot but it was a great kick. The star of the dish was the bread. Wow! What a bread, crunchy outside, moist on the inside, it was music to my ears.
The only thing I would change or recommend to the restaurant - and this is an overall critique to new orleans restaurants - it's its plating. Kind of poor. The starters are appetizers so the portions are ok. You would expect what you get. But on the other side the entrées are in the poor side. For example the sandwich was just the sandwich, no potatoes no greens nothing to garnish the plate. So in general it seems a little bit overpriced everything because the plates are ""small"" and this is something that happens not only at Cafe Amelie but in the whole area from French Quarter to Garden District.
Anyway, this place was one the best and it will be remembered for sure. Next time I'll try the cajun poutine recommend by our waiter that it's fingerling potatoes, cheese and cochon du lait on top. EXCELENT!!",2015-11-15 15:46:25

This past event, we arrived 30 mins prior to the market opening. The truck was parked almost directly in front of the entrance. There were no other trucks there at that time. The truck's windows were opened, and I saw 2 men inside, but there was no sign showing if it was actually serving or not. No one else was around the truck, but it was raining and at that time no line was forming in front of the venue. We approached the back of the truck because that door was also open and one of the men inside looked to be cooking on a grill. Another man was coming out and down towards us. I said ""Are you open?"" He said "" uhh...no."" and continued past me. At this time I expected him to finish with ""We open at...."" or ""We aren't quite ready yet"" but nothing. I said ""Wow..is there anywhere around here to get a cup of coffee or a quick bite?"" He turned and shrugged and looked annoyed and said ""I don't think so...I don't really know"". Again, I've seen the truck here prior and I know its a local truck. As I turned to leave, slightly frustrated, I said to my friend ""He's here every Punk Rock Flea Market, and he 'doesn't really know'..."" I was sarcastic, but I did not say it to him or even look back at him. He overheard me and started yelling ""Hey...Hey!! Are you getting an attitude with me?"" Very loudly and almost threateningly. Like what if I did have an attitude? I was hungry and it was raining and he was most unhelpful, but I was walking away. Do you think I'm going to be happy about it? I am also female. The last thing I need is to feel threatened because I made a comment under my breath. That uptight arrogance and the fact that he was almost picking a fight with me as I was WALKING AWAY is enough to turn me off for good. I don't claim the customer is always right, but in this case I didn't even get the chance to be a customer, and that is not conducive to being in the service business.",2012-12-11 04:07:27
U7Uqdh3oX7eOjkk4OGKZug,RUqhq_9r6no6LA9TMQqgUA,WkcmS4_R6iCUdxuNEEcM-Q,2.0,2,0,0,"My family and I went to Grand Hacienda on 4th street for an early dinner, around 5pm Friday night, May 25th. We stood and waited for the hostess, an older hispanic woman, as she rushed around talking to other servers and writing something on a little notepad. We stood there waiting for a while, watching her, while some others entered behind us and got frustrated with the wait, complaining that they had reservations and shouldn't have to wait at all. Once we sat, we were then moved to a different table. Overall, none of this was a big deal. 

Our server, a young hispanic man, comes and takes our drink order, and I'm informed that they have no juice options at all. Not even from the bar. So my kids can have either water or sprite. Fine, they get a sprite. 
Chips and salsa comes quickly. Chips are hot, but the salsa's flavor is not that great. It kind of tastes like ketchup. I see in the menu that there is no kid's food section at all.

 Server comes and I ask if they have a kids menu and he says no. No kid's menu. He lists off some things that they make for kids, but he speaks quietly and quickly and I don't understand half of what he lists. I say fine, a cheese quesadilla for the kids, plus some beans and rice. I then order the plantain appetizer and some guacamole. He brings the guac, which doesn't look very fresh (and certainly wasn't the ""table-side preparation"" that the menu claimed it would be,) and it's completely flavorless. No seasoning, no lime juice in it. Fine, whatever. 

So then we order our entrees. My husband orders the veggie fajitas, and asks if he can get a small side of their mole sauce. This mole sauce is supposed to be available as an option to go on the enchiladas, so he asks if he can just get a side of it in a little cup. The server gives him a quizzical look, but nods his head. I ask for the carne asada, and I point out that menu says it comes with rice, and either beans or a potato enchilada. I ask if I can have both beans and the enchilada. He seems completely confused by my request. I show him the menu explanation and he nods and writes stuff down. I also ask if I could have verde sauce on the enchilada instead of the red sauce. He nods, and walks away. I didn't consider this a complicated request, but he seemed completely thrown by it. 

Eventually our food is delivered (and while we're waiting I hear a white guy -- I assume the manager -- explaining to the table next to us that everything is cooked to order, so expect about a 30 minute prep for the food. The customer asks if the appetizers will take thirty minutes too. He says no, and goes into this thing how he was just explaining that the food isn't pre-prepared, it's all cooked when it's ordered, so he just wants them to expect a 30 min wait for their entrees. But... this is a nice looking, sit down restaurant. Why on earth would anyone assume anything differently about how they prepare the food? It SHOULD all be cooked to order. It's not a Chiptole. That all seemed sort of weird and unnecessary. )

Anyway. Instead of the potato enchilada with verde sauce, I get a chicken enchilada with red sauce. I explain that's not what I ordered -- that the menu said it would be the potato enchilada. Server is completely confused. He says he will go get me a potato enchilada and leaves. I remind him about the verde sauce instead of the red sauce please, and also that we still haven't received our fried plantain appetizer. He looks confused, walks away. 
He comes back with a potato enchilada with red sauce, and a basket of plantain chips out of, I assume, a bag. They're like potato chips. I'm confused. The menu says the plantain appetizer is fried plantains with sour cream and a chipotle sauce. I ask, ""this is your fried plantain appetizer?"" He says, ""what? I don't know."" I tell him it's on your menu. He gives me a blank stare. He says the kitchen's really backed up and shrugs. I guess that's supposed to explain why I can't order the plantain appetizer. I hand him back the basket of plantain chips because we don't want them, and I decide it's not even worth raising the issue of the red sauce on my enchilada after I asked repeatedly for verde sauce. So we never get our plantain appetizer. Also, the mole sauce that my husband asked for is just red enchilada sauce. 
Overall, food was good, but the service was kind of terrible. The manager needs to train their staff on their menu ASAP. I can't fathom how they could get through dinner rushes when servers basically ignore an order that their customers have made (our plantains) because they don't understand what's on their own menu. He could have picked on up and actually read the menu right there, but he didn't. Or maybe that's where the language barrier was -- maybe he couldn't read English? I don't know. If that's the case they should definitely have menus printed for them in Spanish. Not doing that is disservice to them as much as it is to the customers.",2018-05-26 15:29:31

We walked in and the bar was full so we sat at a table. The bartender seemed very distracted and flustered doing stuff behind the bar (my assumption was that they were switching staff) so we had to go up to the bartender to let him know we were there even though we were right there in front of him. I don't blame him though, it happens. He came over a minute later, took our drink orders and promptly brought them over. 

He continued to be busy but came over a few minutes later to take our food order. I ordered chili to share to start off with and WOW, I think this is one of the best chilis I ever had. It was chunky and meaty and they throw some sour cream and lots of cheese on top. They also give you some chips to dip with. The chips were a bit stale though. 

After that, my boyfriend got an opened face turkey sandwich with gravy and I got the buffalo tenders (a previous review recommended them, that's why I decided to go with those.) I love me some good buffalo tenders. The buffalo tenders were very, very tasty. Although I didn't try my boyfriend's dinner, it didn't look very appealing to me. He said it tasted good but it was on very plain white loaf bread, certainly nothing special. Looks like something I'd make at home if I had a loaf of bread and some leftover turkey as an easy dinner. He picked it off the daily specials menu (and it wasn't the day of the special so maybe they improvised.) If you go there, I'd probably stick with one of their everyday items - just in case!

They have a really good beer list, their taps are all the normal domestics, with a couple exceptions - but they have an extensive bottle list. I paid 15 dollars for a large bottle of raspberry lambic, and got a couple half pints to make dirty hoes with. 2.50 for a half glass of hoegaarden and I got 3 dirty hoes out of the bottle of lambic. The bartender gave me the third half pint for free! He was a really nice guy.

(In case you don't know what a dirt hoe is, it's half hoegaarden, half raspberry lambic - highly recommended drink! You can use other lambics too.) 

Good atmosphere, decent bar food, GREAT CHILI, good beer list, nice hdtvs.

Worst experience of my life!

I brought my dog Max to Dr Lampru because I had found good reviews and as he was an older dog I wanted to find the best alternatives for him.

 He started displaying problems chewing his food, this turned into not eating which caused him to lose weight drastically. We were referred to her because of holistic approach and her openness to try alternative therapies. She did an evaluation and some blood work, and prescribed a series of enzymes and dietary changes, ignoring that the problem was that he could not chew, we told her that we had found a lump in his mouth and thought that might be the problem, but she dismissed it. 

We called almost everyday to tell her that he was simply not eating so that the supplements were not going into his system.

We brought Max to her for a follow up, the following week and he had lost even more weight. At that time she diagnosed him as having cancer and that the mass in his mouth had to be removed, but that she was booked until the following week and that she only did surgeries on Thursday, so we would have to wait. 

When we returned Max had lost even more weight, at this point my 69lbs dog was at 39lbs!! 

She then said that she would not operate because he was too weak and that from her experience and I quote 'I can tell that the cancer has spread and is taking over his body therefore the only thing I can suggest is that we put him to sleep'. She was cold and zero bed side manor. She GAVE UP without ever really trying. She said that he would not live past the weekend. I said NO and that I would take him home. She injected him with a narcotic pain killer and sent him home with us. The pain killer on an empty stomach caused internal bleeding in the upper GI tract. 

I took Max to another vet and then another we got 2nd n 3rd opinions which did x-rays and concluded that Max did not have cancer and therefore had not spread, he had a abscess that was infected and causing pain therefore he did not want to eat. They prescribed antibiotics and a mild pain killers and when the swelling and infection were gone they removed the lump. For over a month Dr Lampru saw my dog SUFFERING and did NOTHING. All he needed was simple antibiotics and for someone to listen to what we were telling her, we probably wouldn't of lost so much weight had she done something about it when we first brought him to her.

Above all SHE DIAGNOSED MY DOG WITH CANCER WITHOUT EVER TAKING AN X-RAY, BIOPSY, OR SCAN. She gave my dog a life sentence, I am glad I didn't take her advice.  

I have called her office every day for over week after getting the correct diagnosis and she has yet to call me back.

I am outraged and hope you will never have to go through what we went through. 
Max is my best friend and companion, I know that one day he will not be with us, but it was not his time. I wonder how many people have lost their companion because of her malpractice.",2012-02-07 07:37:42
TIdcAX5aDn40d2Xq4BfdaA,CZL4uF5XQqHmWAkC4wZFUA,UQOR4jwKlNzxvgGjZTXIYA,5.0,0,0,1,"When you think of pretzels you likely think of the little hard kind that come in a bag (kinda like chips) or the ones that hang in those spinner machines (covered in salt) at sporting events. Unfortunately in Canada, that's generally the extent of our pretzel experience. Thankfully Zwick's is on the scene to forever change Edmonton's severely lacking pretzel scene. It's something that you didn't even know that you needed. (But you absolutely do!) They were even featured on Big Food Bucket List in season two!

You'll find Zwick's in Westmount (in a small area that is particularly packed with amazing food) and you'll spot their tiny location when you see their turquoise signage. The space is very small and there isn't much to it. The walls are painted with black chalkboard paint, turning almost every inch of wall space into the menu. (Whoever writes the menu has very nice printing!) There's a large communal table that takes up the rest of the tiny space, which makes it possible to eat-in should you want to. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is almost always lined up and busy. I visited on a Saturday evening with full intentions of building an entire dinner meal out of pretzels.
Each pretzel is made fresh-to-order so sometimes there's a bit of a wait while your food gets prepared. Because of this, Zwick's will give you a buzzer so that you can wait outside (again, the inside space is very small) which will alert you once your food is ready.
I started my journey with a drink and was delighted to find an array of housemade sodas on the menu - but especially the Strawberry Apple Shrub ($3.00). As far as I know, Zwick's is the only place in Edmonton that serves shrub, which is very exciting. What is ""shrub"" you ask? Now stay with me because this is going to get a bit weird. Shrub is a drinking vinegar. The acidic syrup is mixed with fruit creating a beverage that is full of depth and complexity. It's really interesting; you get that slight vinegar flavour but it's incredibly enjoyable. Non-alcoholic cocktails have come a very long way in recent years. The shrub at Zwick's is truly wonderful and refreshing, and I loved the way that it tasted like real, fresh strawberries. (Plus vinegar and strawberries are totally friends already - have you tried balsamic black pepper strawberries? They're fabulous.)

Next, let's talk about the pretzels. These dough twists originated in Germany and have been around for a very long time. Zwick's makes regular-sized pretzels but also nubs that come in a bag, all hand-rolled. There are basic, dusted, and cheese varieties (ten different flavours in total!). Personally, I'm a huge fan of the cheese pretzels... Because CHEESE! There are three different Cheese Pretzels ($3.00 each) and I ordered one of each for a full ""flight"" of cheese pretzels. (I highly recommend doing this for maximum life enjoyment.) They also offer eleven different Dips ($1.00 each) which are a must. Each pretzel is freshly baked, warm and soft, and positively covered in cheese. If you're a fan of crispy fried cheese bits (who isn't?) this is the snack for you. First up, the Spicy Scallion & Mozza, which is probably the most popular pretzel at Zwick's. Covered in a garlic chili sauce, mozzarella, scallions, baked, and then painted with garlic butter... This pretzel is a masterpiece. It's got heat and is packed with flavour. I love this one. Next is the Guajillo Feta, which I also loved. The guajillo chili brings a light heat and I enjoyed the saltiness from the feta. Lastly, the Cheddar & Black Pepper feels like a great classic. I mean, melty cheddar cheese? It doesn't get much better. All three of these pretzels are absolutely perfect. There are a lot of dips to choose from and I grabbed the Zesty Tomato and Dill & Onion Cream. They were both very delicious and complimented the pretzels well. (They also have cheese dips if you want even more cheese.)

I wanted to order something from the Sides section of the menu to round out our meal. The Dill, Pea & Potato Salad ($3.50) seemed like a good bet. This simple salad was decently nice. The potato chunks were tender and I liked the pops of bright green peas. I would have liked it to be a bit more flavourful but this was a good way to make the meal feel like more than just bread products.

Next, I rolled on over to the Sausages section because I absolutely had to try the Pizza Zweenie (Zweenie topped with zesty tomato sauce, mozzarella, parmesan & pepperoni - $7.00), which is something new that they've recently started serving. It's a smoked pork weenie on pretzel bun - covered in pizza toppings! The weenie itself was very juicy, flavourful, and nicely snappy. And you certainly can't go wrong with heaping amounts of pizza stuff. I really liked the tiny pepperoni. You know that your mouth wants this.

I saved the best for last. It's time for the best thing on the menu at Zwick's: from the Sandwichzel section (yes, sandwiches made out of a pretzel bun) you'll find t",2021-05-25 16:47:47

I was in need of a nail salon that does great gel manicures, professional, friendly, welcoming and most of all Clean. Well, If first impressions mean anything then I think I've found it. I read great reviews on Corals Nail salon,shorty of the helpers spoke highly of Sophia and what great work she does, so I said hey why not?!:) I narrowed my search of my next great nail salon down to 2 in the center city area. I decided to give Corals a try given the location most importantly, it's right off of the broad st. Line. Def. important for me since I do not drive Into the city & again majority of the reviews were positive. I called on a Thursday morning b/4 Mother's Day weekend, wanting to beat the flood of women that would be filling all nail salons in preparation of the upcoming holiday. I made a 6:30pm apt. W/Sophia & although I arrived 5 mins. Late when I walked in, not only was I greeted with a smile but I was seated immediately and The same nail tech. that greeted me with the welcoming smile showed me to the gel polishes and helped me to pick a color to replace the initial color I wanted to get by OPI, her pick was a good one, which was a very pretty pink to match my dress I planned to wear on Mother's Day. She immediately starting removing my previous gel polish which was removed for free given I was getting another gel polish service. (Other salons have a charge of 5$ on top of their 25-35 fee for Gel Polish which I think is too much especially if, I am not only getting the gel polish again but also leaving a tip as well). As I waited for polish to come off Sophia give me a back massage which was unexpected, but much needed and appreciated. She was very neat and took her time caring for my nails, filing and buffing them to ensure my nail bed was still healthy. She polished my nails very well and even helped me to choose a simple rhinestone design for my ring fingers. In the End all I can say is, ""I'll Be Back!"" Lol. But seriously, don't hesitate if ur searching for a great nail salon with great service and reasonable prices. Call and make ur apt. At Corals Nails & ask for Sophia. I am a Happy customer & I hope this will be the nail salon I continue to go to years from now for all my special occasion needs.",2015-05-11 20:47:11

I highly recommend this property for value and comfort.

The positives:
-Easy online check in with the Marriott App!
-Mike at the front desk could not have been a better first impression. Friendly, helpful, a wonderful smile to be greeted by upon arrival.
-Beautiful updated lobby and rooms.
-Bedding was soft, room was clean, spacious and comfy with plenty of room for me and my husband.
-Microwave and mini-fridge were wonderful to have in the room.
-Couch/seating area was comfortable and wonderful to have rather than just a bed to sit on.
-Bathroom was spacious and updated, clean.
-Easily accessible indoor swimming pool. 
-Convenient location.

The negatives
-The shower functionality is a miss. They have a glass barrier but no door or curtain so the shower stall is open air. Water went everywhere! It also let the cold air in so not ideal for ladies to shave your legs with cold air coming in. It looks really nice but missed the mark with function.
-We did not receive maid service one day ( I realized later it was because my husband put out the Do not Disturb sign) so when I called the lobby at 9 pm that night after returning to our room and realizing I had no coffee for the next morning it rang and rang for 10 minutes with no answer. I sent my husband down stairs to see if he could find someone to give us a coffee pack and the night clerk was in the office watching a movie on her phone.
-Saturday night there was a bad lightening storm and lightening struck in the parking lot disabling the fire alarms. Because of this we were woken up by firefighters pounding on the doors screaming at us to get to the lobby at 12:30 am. We had to sit down there for over an hour before they would let us back into the building. I understand this isn't the hotel's fault, but what bugged me was that no one at the hotel actually informed us of what was going on, no formal announcement or anything. I knew the building wasn't on fire because we were still in it, but some communication from the hotel staff would have been nice. Also I feel they should have offered us beverages or something while we waited. 
-There was also no one at the front desk when we left the day of our departure at 6 am. I just had to write a note that room 308 checked out and left it with my keys on the desk. I did want to speak with someone about the fire alarm issue, but no one was there.",2016-05-30 16:08:15

I arrived with 4 bridesmaids, and told an employee my name. While we waited to be helped, we looked at some dresses. I wasn't overwhelmed with the variety, but I figured a sales associate would show me additional available colors and styles, and would tell me about our options in terms of ordering dresses in other colors. A few minutes later, we were approached by an employee who would be ""helping"" us. She did not give me her name (or at least I didn't hear it), so I will call her Jane. Jane brought us to the back to our dressing room. Nobody else was in the back, so I asked if we could temporarily use the neighboring dressing room/s, to which the associate said no, without any real explanation. Subsequently, my bridesmaids began trying a few dresses on in the one dressing room. Jane had disappeared at this point, so I began looking for her. After a failed attempt to find her, I went out into the room where the dresses were, and picked out a few more dresses. Another employee approached me and asked me who was helping me; I responded that I did not know her name. I chose some more dresses, and brought them back to the dressing room. After discussing the limited bridesmaids dress options with my bridesmaids, we were hoping to try on the Hayley Paige bridesmaids dresses that were advertised in the dressing room. One of my bridesmaids found a couple Hayley Paige dresses in the room full of dresses, but they were not both navy, which is what we were looking for. As I continued to state that I couldn't find Jane, she suddenly emerged from a small employee closet/room and she was chewing something. After the initial shock I had regarding her astonishing indifference to making a sale, I asked her if she had any Hayley Paige dresses in navy (besides the one we found). She left for a few minutes, and when she was back, she simply did not have an answer for me. It was bizarre how she acted. It was like pulling teeth with her, trying to figure out if they had the Hayley Paige dresses in navy. It continues to be a mystery. I just wanted a yes or no answer. Finally, we gave up and decided to leave. Once we said we were leaving, it was then that Jane took out a form and asked me to write my information down and she began asking me questions about my wedding. Since this disgraceful experience, I have told everyone to avoid Nordstrom's wedding suite at KOP. They completely wasted our time. Perhaps Jane was a disgruntled employee, but I am scarred. We ended up going to the Bridal Garden in Marlton and all of my bridesmaids chose beautiful indigo Hayley Paige dresses. Don't waste your time at Nordstrom's!",2016-08-23 18:46:08
a2k_p1ca0mxh8KcQPS22dQ,kxa3OK_FdPVk5_VXQtSc_w,St_IvztJGWq1jep2ABij6Q,1.0,4,0,0,"Literally the worst experience with any company I have ever interacted with to-date. We agreed to a two shower job for a reasonable price and an installation date was scheduled. The first shower in our master bathroom went well. However, the installer attempted to pass off a brushed nickel shower door frame, that was spray painted black, as oil rubbed bronze. The spraypaint was already chipping off! So, I obviously voiced my opinion and the installer agreed to correct the issue. My wife and I only experienced grief from this point up until three months later when the job was finally completed. The date on the original invoice was 4/20/2016 and the final installation was on 7/20/2016. We received excuse after excuse and were even stood-up days in a row waiting for the seemingly hopeless job to be finished. Many vacation hours were used on these incompetents. I was even told that the second half of the job would be free at one point, so I was left on the hook like a patiently waiting fool. After waiting probably another month and a half, my wife and I finally had enough. Our daughter has been using our shower for 3 months and we have a baby shower next week and didn't want the unfinished bathroom to exemplify the poor decision we made in hiring this company. I AGAIN called the company and finally spoke to someone who seemed like they were going to give us the reprieve we deserved, after foolishly waiting so long for a simple shower door install. I was told that the ""balance of what you owe"" would be free and that the job would finally be completed the following week. She also blatantly lied to me and told me that her husband and co-proprietor (Jeff), who I had been talking to the whole time, was only ""just an installer."" Okay, so AGAIN I was at ease and patiently waited. My wife had no faith that they would actually show this time, but I did. The installers showed up, late, but at least they made it. They did acceptable work and were pleasant people. Then came time for the final invoice. $525 didn't seem very complementary to me, and I explained what I had been told. After a discussion between the installers and someone at the office, I signed the invoice free of charge and thought, ""I'm finally home free!!!"" Nope... I immediately received a phone call from the same woman before, but with a rude and an aggressive tone. She apparently either regretted her offer to me and altered it, or forgot about it. She spoke to me in a very condescending manner as if I were a child, after I waited 3 months for a shower door. When I tried to explain what I heard her tell me the week before, she kept interrupting me and telling me not to argue with her. When I really lost it was when she said, ""I'm only going to take a credit card from you. I don't trust you. You can stop payment on a check."" Seriously? I pride myself with my financial responsibility. My credit scores are in the 800s and I have never missed a payment in my life. Furthermore, my wife and I were being victimized for 3 months and she didn't trust us!?!? The worst part of all of this is that, early in the process, I actually referred them to a colleague of mine. Trinity Glass once again made me look like a fool by not being prepared with the correct hardware and extending that project, as well as leaving holes in her wall because the installers did not have a studfinder. Needless to say, Trinity Glass is the last company I will be using or recommending for future projects.

PS: She most certainly did speak to me in that manner, and I quoted her verbatim.",2016-07-24 02:16:18
feSrzTXe6NecY-pro6j0Ew,Hp5qAmf84pxb9rCKpPBUiA,5j8T4Hl284i0nwVoVSlYZQ,3.0,1,0,0,"Today, my daughter took me to the spa at the grand Sierra resort and casino. It was supposed to be a day of rest and relaxation for my birthday, but turned out to be anything but. She called ahead to ask if we would be able to use the day passes that she had, and she was told that as long as we were there before 12:30, that there wouldn't be a problem. We showed up at about 12:15, and were met by assistant manager, Christopher Pierce. Everything was fine, he was ready to take the day passes, until I reached for my daughter's arm to take it so that we could move, and then his demeanor changed. All of a sudden, there were no lockers free, he told us this before calling back to check to see if there were any lockers free, then he made a call back and told us that there was only one locker free. We told him that sharing a locker wouldn't a problem, and he told us that it was for people who had booked services. We asked him if he had any available slots so that we could book any services, and he said all slots for all services were booked for today. We asked him if he had anything available for facials, massages, and he said everything was booked. We left and sat down around the corner, and my daughter proceeded to call The spa. Christopher answered the phone and proceeded to tell her that he had slots available for all services today. He was in the process of getting her information when we walked back through the door and he realized that he was talking to the very same person who he had lied to just a few minutes before, and he'd been  caught. When he hung up the phone, he told us that he was denying us service, though he denied the reason. The minute he realized that I'm blind was when he decided that I couldn't enjoy the spa, though we've been told that the grand Sierra doesn't.discriminate against anybody based on color, race, creed, disability, or anything. When we asked for his supervisor's information, he wouldn't give us a name or number, and told us that his supervisor wouldn't be in until June 4, though we found out from somebody else that he will be back on May 29. When asked for his business card, he gave us a business card for somebody else named Christopher, different last name, who is a massage therapist there. He was more than happy to throw one of his massage therapists under the bus, hoping that he would get the bad review, rather than himself. That is not something that I would be proud of when hiring my management staff. My daughter had to go find somebody outside the spa to get help, Omar, and he was able to intervene and we were able to enter the spaw as of 3 o'clock, 2 1/2 hours after my daughter was originally told that we could go in. We had a great time once we went in, because Christopher wasn't at the desk. A nice guy named Josh was there. We went in with no incident, and enjoyed ourselves. Later, we found out by talking to other employees, that they were not at capacity, as we were told earlier, and that he didn't actually make a call to find out how many lockers were available.  Without making a call, he actually had no idea whether they were at capacity or not. He even lied to the employee who intervened to defuse the situation. He had that employee believing that they were over capacity as well, when they weren't. What he did tell us was that they were at 52, and the capacity is 50. Maybe somebody should look into this, because if he was letting more people than should be in there, and then using that as an excuse to not let me in, he was already violating code. Imagine my hurt and confusion when I realized that not only was the spaw not even at capacity when we were in, but he faked the call to find out how many lockers were available when he told us that there was only one. We had to speak to other employees to find out this information though, and we shouldn't have had to go through any of this. It takes a lot for me to write a negative review, and this did it. I don't take discrimination lightly, but this was a blatant display of discrimination, and I thought that we were living in a world where this didn't happen as much, but with people like Christopher around, that isn't the case. I would hope that he would have received the training that he needed to set those feelings aside, or at the very least, wouldn't have been hired if he honestly felt this way, but if that's the way that the GSR feels, I don't know that I'll be back. Other employees told us that that isn't how they were told to act, and I want to believe that. The other employees were wonderful, and I don't want my experience with Christopher to have ruined my birthday celebration, but when the first person that you see when you walk into a place treats you like that, it pretty much did. I want to thank the other employees who were kind and helpful today! You guys are what I would expect in a spa! You guys are who make the spa.",2018-05-28 05:20:46

Never in my life have I ever had a dentist like Dr. Jeff Rohde (and Associates).  

Aside from the obvious fact that he is an outstanding, state-of-the-art dentist and clearly cares, he has managed to put together an entire team of genuinely lovely people who support all of that.  The ""and Associates"" is a very important part of any medical office and Dr Rohde clearly gets that.  I have only started going since last summer and have met 7 or 8 different people on his support team, ALL of whom I would be happy to run into at a party.  They are warm, engaging, funny, friendly, interesting and professional and somehow, on top of all that, their efficiency kung fu is very strong.  

You can tell this is a thriving practice when you come in as the phones are often ringing and appointments are being booked.  But that's not off putting in the least.  Both of the 2 women who work the front desks are still super warm and friendly and it's typical to be checked in within 60 seconds or less.  The only reason it would ever take longer is because you might find yourself in a casual conversation with either of them like you would a neighbor over fence.  I realize it's odd to rave so much about the support staff, but they truly deserve it. They always make me feel like one of their favorite people out of (I'm sure) hundreds and hundreds of happy patients.  

The comfy waiting room has fresh, craft coffee always brewed and if that doesn't appeal, there's a Keurig machine there with all of the flavored options.  The longest I've ever spent in the waiting room (because I didn't have an appointment and they squeezed me in due to an emergency root canal) was just enough time to have a cuppa and observe these things.

But to the heart of the issue: Dr. Jeff Rohde is one of the most pleasant, warm and friendly people I may have ever met in town!  I know it sounds over the top to say that, but I'm sure any of his existing patients would agree.  It just happens that he's a state of the art dentist who loves his work.  Working with anyone in any field who loves what they do is always a treat. By ""state of the art,"" I've seen my dental x-rays appear in (literally) 1-2 seconds on a high res. screen in front of me immediately after taking them.  There are big, beautiful flat screens in every examination room.  My 12 year old son has had plaque and tartar removed from his teeth with a laser.  It's a painless cavity repair device and makes one feel as if the future (as seen in Star Trek) has finally arrived.  As we worked to get an implant done for me, I watched 3-D modeling spring up on the screen so we could see exactly what we were doing all 360 degrees. And the fact that they can measure and create brand new porcelain caps IN-HOUSE in about an hour or so is just mind blowing.  No more waiting with horrible, plastic temporaries that fall out and have to be avoided when chewing anything!  It's just amazing.  

Dr. Rohde is truly the all-in-one, one stop shopping dentist as I was fitted for the very unobtrusive Invisalign braces that I will wear for only 5-6 months to gently adjust my teeth for the implant.  The only thing I've experienced so far that he does not do in-office, is root canal work.  And there is good reason to go with a specialist for that.  I needed an emergency root canal yesterday, which leads to the best case scenario experience I had below.

After having sensitivity to hot and cold things, I finally called Rohde's office and asked if they could squeeze me in for an emergency consult.  The amazing ""and Associates"" got me in at around 3:30 on a Thursday and even though nothing came up on x-rays, Jeff had a very strong feeling that something might be going on underneath a cap I had on a molar.  The x-rays could not see through it, but all signs pointed toward that being the source of my pain.  They called Dr. Lawaty's office (I had seen her for my only root canal 9 years prior and she was amazing) and somehow got me an appointment for 5 minutes later.  She's only about 6-7 blocks away and sure enough, she diagnosed that I very likely had some gnarly infection going on under an old cap and booked me for a 6:30am root canal surgery the next morning.

I left her office about 5pm and decided to rush back to Dr. Rohde to see if he was still open.  I was hoping he might be able to take me in as soon as the root canal was done and do the permanent crown.  If he was unable to, I'd have to wear a temporary through the weekend when I was scheduled to do a couple hours of public speaking.  I raced over, got there about 5:15 and realized the office was closed, but the door was still open so I stuck my head in.  Dr. Rohde appeared along with one of the front desk women and they were obviously on their way out.  I told them my plight and asked if I could get in right after the Friday root canal to get the permanent crown done.  Unbeknownst to me, they close the office at 1pm on Friday and they",2017-01-28 17:54:46

This was one of the few if only places in Santa Barbara that met all of our requirements.  We stayed in the Woodthrush room which had a king bed, bathroom, and small private hot tub.

We stumbled upon the small parking lot behind the inn by accident and proceeded to the front door.  A young man greeted us and introduced himself.  We then had to sign several forms and pay up front.  I was suprised by how cluttered the main house was - items nearly bursting from cupboards.  The owner/inn keeper was in the office off of the kitchen but made no effort to greet or welcome us which I thought was odd.  I would've liked to learn more about the property.

Our room was ok but definitely not worth nearly $300/night.  Mattress was really soft and sagging and the mini fridge in the bathroom didn't make much sense.  While the bathroom was really large, things were awkwardly placed.  The toilet was wedged between the wall and clawfoot tub making it almost impossible to sit on (seriously) unless you were a very small child.  The shower curtains surrounding the tub were so cheap (dollar store quality) that they stuck to you while you tried to shower under the low water pressure.  Very uncomfortable!  Towels seemed extra small (especially the bath towels!) and sheets on the bed were not high quailty either.  It would've been nice to have high quality linens at a B&B like this.

We stopped by the complimentary happy hour where we were greeted with a sign telling us 1 glass of wine only.  The appetizers were limited and really sad as in 5 limp carrots in a bowl with store bought dip of some kind.  There were a few cheeses and some crackers but that was it.  Again, the owner/inn keeper was in the ktichen with the happy hour stuff but didn't greet us or introduce herself.  The brownies and cider/coffee at night were nice except you could only enter through the front door of the main house and the paths between cottages were not lit. 

We were looking forward to a nice breakfast  but were suprised not only by the lack of meat and limited selection, but also by how little food there actually was.  There appeared to only be one breakfast casserole for a sold out crowd and it was ladden with huge chucks of zucchini.  There were a few (3-5) store bought bread options and some cantaloupe and that was pretty much it.  We ended up stopping for breakfast after we left the property.  The man serving breakfast was polite but not overly friendly and did not introduce himself.  The outdoor seating in the garden was nice but the garden desperately needed some up keep!

In the end, we didn't feel welcome or comfortable which was disappointing because our experience could've been a lot better!",2012-09-12 02:03:25
5ddhatGmu5YlfHEyWBQwng,5JRAEvsO_MmIU9DTppPdKg,gy3XoTsWd-DzQrr6moWi_g,1.0,3,0,0,"My wife and I decided to go to the Sizzler for a couple reasons. 1st, we had not been there is a long long time and thought maybe they had improved. Second, we needed to keep the eating out cost down and thought they would be a cheaper placed to eat.

Lets start with the good. The steak was not bad. Actually, for the price, it was pretty good. It was not fat or grisly. It was a bit tuff, which of course comes from not being a good cut of beef. But for the price, it was actually pretty good.

Then came the toast. They had taken some shredded cheddar cheese and added some to 1 side. Then toasted it. The result was a good cheesy crunch. Something simple, yet creative that I had not had even had fancier restaurants. It was unexpected to be sure and the highlight of my meal.

Now for the bad. I had the steak and Malibu Chicken. Now, I remember having this in years past, but I don't remember it being this bad. My 8 year old daughter order the Chicken strips. I looked at her plate, then to mine, then back again to hers. It was the exact same chicken strips that she had. She of course loved hers, but she is 8. I was not amused.

Did Sizzler take me for 8? The strips were straight out of a bag of frozen tasteless chicken strips. On top of the strip of Chicken was some ham. Not just any decent ham. It was the same disgusting thin sliced ham that you find in one of those bags of sandwich meat in the store, which sale for about 50 cents. The taste was terrible!!!

Then on top of this mess was a little cheese. The result was something so awful, that if it hadn't been for the fact that I was really hungry, I would have spit it out and not eaten another bite. Then probably washed down the bite I had spit out with water as fast as I could. Yes, it was that bad!!

The fries were also straight out of a frozen bag. The bland and totally tasteless kind that you have to drown in ketchup to get any flavor at all. The decoration was non existent. It reminded me of Denny's. Well, actually Denny's décor would have been an improvement to this place.

Steer clear of this place!!",2012-12-08 02:14:27

Don't let that fool you! This Himalayan/Nepalese restaurant is fantastic! A true gem hiding in plain sight. 

A few of the favorite dishes are the: 

Mixed Grill Platter 
A protein lover's feast"" is right! Tender chunks of chicken breast, lamp, chicken drumsticks and thighs, and shrimp grilled in a tandoori oven and served on a bed of sautéed cabbage. The meats are tender, juice and incredibly flavorful. Perfectly complimented with a squeeze of lemon. 

Tse Phing 
Delicious pan-fried mung bean noodles sauteed with mushrooms, cabbage, carrots, celery and onion. The flavor is phenomenal! For me, these noodles can stand up against just about any meat & noodle dish on their own. They're that flavorful. It's a Tibetan dish that is slightly reminiscent of the Filipino dish, pancit. 

Hariyo Phulkopi 
Fresh broccoli sautéed with butter and spices. It's not over cooked so it retains some crunch while maintaining fork tender to the touch. This is a great match with the Mixed Grill Platter to incorporate plant nutrients and fiber. 

Chicken Tikka Masala & Garlic Naan 
Most of you readers will be familiar with these dishes. They are both fantastic. I highly recommend! I prefer using garlic naan in place of silver ware and eating with my hands, enjoying chicken tikka masala with every bite of naan! This means ordering several extra servings! There is no such thing as too much naan! 

The menu is vast at Himalayan Kitchen so recommend ordering a couple of your favorites and also venturing out a trying new dishes too. I've ordered many other items here that were all good, those mentioned in this review just happen to be my go-tos. I look forward to trying it all eventually! 

Two things must not go without mentioning and that is the customer service and the prices! The customer service is top notch! The staff are friendly, accommodating and very generous. I would have to say they're on my top 5 list of best customer service in SB. The prices are also ridiculously low for the amount and quality of food you get. Unlike most small restaurant businesses in this town, the owners of Himalayan Kitchen do not seem interested in bleeding their guests dry of their disposable income simply because it is Santa Barbara and they can. They have priced their menu at family friendly, accessible to all rates and I truly respect that in a business.

I can't speak to their buffet lunch because I haven't tried it as of the date of writing this review but I can highly recommend ordering a meal off of their menu. They also deliver through Yelp's Eat24 (highly recommended, no delivery fee) and SBMenus (not recommended, $4.99 delivery fee and terrible customer service). They also participate in SBAxxess for those of you interested in getting two for one.",2017-10-16 20:32:12

Attendant offered to carry our luggage to the second floor, a valiant gesture,  but my wife could NOT climb stairs. While waiting, she soiled her clothes on the way to a distant 1st floor restroom after negotiating a short set of stairs.  In the midst of this fiasco, the shift changed and the oncoming clerk had no clue as to our difficulty or how to respond.  The elevator was ultimately 'unstuck' and took us to our floor.  I should add that the next morning the manager did give a discount on our first night due to my wife's unfortunate 'accident.'
       The suite was sufficient, but the bathroom was lacking any handrails to aide a handicapped person.  The floors were a hard tile overlay and very unfriendly to walk on.  The TV's and remotes were indiscriminate in their channel selection. Pressing on one channel selection (both TV's) would go to a totally different channel. The TV guide was useless and the remote would only move the channels one at a time. The 'maintenance man' on duty could not fix them.  Unfortunately we did not have a chance to use the pool in their very  attractive patio area.  Also, for such a 'Quality' hotel, I would have expected more than one ice dispenser (it was on the first floor) for the building we where we were assigned.  The housekeeping staff were very helpful, friendly and efficient.
      The 'breakfast menu' offered apples and bananas, but when I asked for bananas the second day I was told that they hadn't been delivered yet. They were miraculously delivered to our room about 5 minutes later.  Later in the day, when we returned from a day trip, we were locked out of our rooms. The desk clerk initially re-keyed our cards for one day, until I reminded him that I had the room reserved for 4 more days.
     The rest of our stay seemed uneventful at the hotel however, several times while in the room my wife and sister complained about the musky aroma in the room. I initially attributed their complaints to keeping the front window and the balcony patio door shut.  Subsequently, while preparing to leave, my sister discovered some black mold in one corner of the bath tub.  On further exam I found mold under caulking around the tub edge, around the soap dish and the stainless steel handrail.
     We will definitely avoid THIS 'Quality' Inn on our next trip.  

PS:  We stayed at the Quality Inn in Jasper, Tennessee just overnight on our way to Florida. That facility was clean, very comfortable and the staff were very friendly.",2021-05-04 18:53:17
HWqLBaNrM2o_E-DzypLz3A,M-E52fd8iMMPNMVVUFsb9w,2WWBX6LiNbE3_Nu7ZJbY3g,1.0,0,0,0,"I had been borrowing my boyfriends car while I was in the process of getting a new one, and took it in for an o&f change and to look at some rattling that was going on.  

I was running late for my appointment, so I called to let them know and they said I would have ""about an hour wait"" which was understandable, because I was late.  I arrive and check in. The guy tells me the wait is ""a couple of hours"" and when I asked why he said, ""Because you are late.""  I had told them on the phone that I would cancel the appointment altogether if being late was a problem.  I also understood I would need to wait an hour.  They said to still come in, and repeated it would be about an hour. Big difference between an hour and a couple of hours. 

Then, he rings me up and I go to sign and I see $53 for the o&f.  WHAT?!??!?!  I asked, ""Why is this o&f so much?"" and he replies, ""Because it is a high mileage car, so we charge more."" I said I didn't really understand and last time I was there it was less than $30.  He said, ""We do this for all high mileage cars and now it's over 150,000 miles.""  This is total bullshit and I know it, but I was already there and I knew it needed to be looked at.  

I coordinated with my boyfriend a ride back to my own car since they wouldn't give me anything other than ""a couple of hours"" as my time estimate.  He gets there to pick me up and long story short, he ends up back there after dropping me off because he is so angry with how they treated me.  The guy actually told my boyfriend that he gave me the option of high mileage or regular o& f and that I told them to go with high mileage- WHAT?!?!  I don't think I would choose to pay approx $30 more for something that I have to.  He actually made up a conversation!

While he was there, they were actually working on the car (so it was not going to be ""a few hours"") they open up the car to check out the rattle and it turns out, it was a definitely a problem.  The tensioner pulley and bolt came apart and it needed a new serpentine belt, which is what we had assumed.  There, with the pulley on the ground, they told my boyfriend they wouldn't be able to get that part or fix the car and he needed to take it somewhere else.  While that was a HUGE LIE, he was okay with it, because at that point, we didn't want them working on the car either!  So...car was towed from Firestone to a new place (which I will also be reviewing, because they were AWESOME) and not only was it able to be fixed, but the part was easily ordered and the job was done in a day.  

We have washed our hands of Firestone and I would definitely recommend you find a different place to have your work done.",2016-03-30 19:27:10
LVVZG-Hye5FjIeTntxTDww,ie9VaHvAaQgjMJP3Gn-AQQ,xBS2bMESuefLuhZMltM_ww,4.0,2,1,1,"So I've probably been here 1000 times, no lie. This joint is cool, perfectly placed and the right blend of what works. I will explain why it didn't get it's 5th star at the bottom and now that there is new management, hopefully I can 1-up them in the future. 

What works: 
They've served La Columbe for years so you can't go wrong there. Also, the baristas really know how to make great drinks (on a cold morning, ask them for a Sunny Latte - it is just magic in a cup). 

They have just the right amount of seating inside and outside so it's never overcrowded, too quiet, too loud. There is out front seating where you can window daze or work with some casual noise. There is a den in the back that is quieter and perfect for studying. Sometimes the music is a little crazy but never overpowering, I'm just guessing their Pandora account must have about 1 million entries. 

The food is pretty good but I don't get it often. I do see a lot of people order their food and some of their staples that are displayed in the case are empty by the evening so their stuff is no doubt popular. 

The baristas are possibly my favorite anywhere in the city. They are always very friendly and personable. I talk to them almost every time I'm there and I don't really know any of them, they are just that friendly. They are good about cleaning tables quickly when someone leaves too. I personally find when customers don't bus their own tables, it's obnoxious, but some people just have to feel entitled or special (more on this on what doesn't work). After all, it's not a restaurant. 

The art flair on the walls is generally pretty good and well displayed on the exposed brick. 

Free wifi and lots of plugs, yes! 

Dog friendly which I like even though I don't have a dog. I've actually seen someone bring in a cat before that sat behind him and slept ( I so want to do that but my cat would be on the counter knocking over drinks) 

Why it doesn't get five stars (right now): 
Since I go so often and have for many years, I've noticed a lot of turnover in the staff and know why, the management treated them all like children. I give most of them credit for putting on a smiley face and serving us despite being lashed from behind. It's bad enough that I've overheard the problems and it's a bit tough for me to want to go there to give the biz money knowing that taskmasters are getting the lion's share while the face of the company gets a raging 8$ p/h before tips. F'ing Lame. They did just change management so I am curious if that will improve. 

If you don't like kids running around in the mornings, you may want to avoid the place for a few hours or sit outside.  It seems to be a safehaven for all the stay-at-home moms, I don't mind, but it can get distracting. (lol, I know coffee shops are full of distractions but children can be like proximity mines of destruction). 

You lose some hipsters here but instead you get upscale ""can't be pleased and should probably just go to Starbucks"" yuppies.  Some people should just wear medals of awesomeness so they don't have to try so hard to come off as better than everyone else, you can just see it and know what's up.

No credit cards. 

Bottom line, this is an awesome cafe with a nice crowd and nice people. I love it here and if it were publicly traded, I'd own stock.",2011-06-21 12:39:57
KKth2WeSuHtgtDkzf7b00Q,XqkhhnE_Cjz5UR79U3TS8Q,_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong,5.0,5,1,3,"It's really hard to write a review for a restaurant that already has over 3,000 reviews. I was teetering between a 4 and a 5 because while the service was outstanding like probably one of the best services that I have ever had food was very good. Flawless might even be an understatement. Honestly, I was blown away. Period. 

We arrived for our Saturday morning brunch. We were taken upstairs. The live jazz brunch is now quite possibly one of my favorite things that I can ever tell stories of to all my friends now. The garlic bread that they brought out was just absolutely phenomenal. The bread essentially melted in your mouth. The bread that was like a baguette was brought to us later and was like my favorite thing with the butter. It paired especially well with my turtle soup. This was my first time having anything turtle and initially I was not pleased but because by the time I was done with my meal, I just kept wanting it to not finish and for me that is the standard by which I want to judge all my foods.

For the main entree, I had the gulf fish which was cooked perfectly and was served with shrimp. It was delicious and I cannot complain. It was a simple dish and I am glad it was because for the dessert course, I had asked the server what does he recommend for dessert. He said to go with the Creole creamcheese cake which was not on the menu. That to me was the best feeling ever. Not knowing what I am about to order but just a basic idea of what's to come because it's like an insider secret. Since my main entree was not too overwhelmingly rich, I was very happy to get the dessert because it was DECADENT. It was absolutely everything that a dessert should be. Rich, sweet, and beautiful.

The coffee that was served was made with chicory. Fun fact that I learned that night was that chicory coffee is less caffeinated than regular coffee and the more bitter the coffee, the less caffeinated it is in general. This I already knew but the fun fact was that chicory is part of the endive family and that it was used by the French during the rule over New Orleans when they were low on the coffee rations. 

The service was so great that I can't explain it except by giving examples of what made me fall in love with it. One of the servers spilled coffee in my friend's saucer while setting the coffee on the table. They were so apologetic and instantly fixed the problem that it was something that I just don't see anymore. If you haven't been to Commander's, I would highly recommend that you make reservations to go eat there, right now.",2018-07-29 04:10:37

When a search of all other restaurants in the area yielded early closing times, we were pleased to discover that Wood Fired Pizza Wine Bar was open to cure our hunger pangs. To make sure we called the restaurant, as a quiet Sunday night could be cause for the restaurant to close its doors early (upon getting there our server said that it was smart of us to call because closing time depends on volume of the restaurant). 

Upon arriving we discovered a nicely laid out and arranged restaurant with wafting smells of wood fired pizza. The furnishings were nice and tasteful and there were plenty 4 flat screen tvs arranged on the walls which were displaying sports games. The pizza oven is in the back left corner of the restaurant and had one to two people presiding in the cooking area at all all times, it was interesting to see this kind of ""open kitchen"". There are a combination of tables and booths and the restaurant can accommodate larger parties. 

Dan, our server, was very helpful and accommodating, not to mention he was patient with our indecisiveness. We chose to order a large Carnivore and two other small pizzas-a Big Sexy Pie and Pizza Raquel. Each pizza came out as it was ready and in a relatively short time we were chewing down. The Carnivore had a combination of meats and cheese and was well liked by our party. The Pizza Raquel was what it was but the least liked of our group however I liked the fresh flavors. The Big Sexy Pie was my favorite; I loved how the combination of flavors shined and complimented each other--you will my be disappointed. The crust on these pizzas is pretty great, and not like at other artisan pizza places where charred crust is the norm (I'll pass on the carcinogenic matter, thanks). 

The restaurant has food for every taste and preference-vegetarian, vegan, and meat eaters-and orders can be modified to your liking. I enjoy that WFP has a variety of appetizers as well as offers two desserts, house made cannoli a and tiramisu. On a future visit I hope to have a salad and other appetizers as I have heard good things. The day we were there we also learned about their ""Endless Pizza Lunch Buffet"" for $9.95 which had just began that day. There is a great variety of craft beers and wine available as well. Thank you to Wood Fired Pizza for accommodating us food mongers and for the stellar service!",2015-11-03 13:18:21
QR6KFiGlwSyvPveUcX4jeQ,qbyksPhVKHerFO2Jt9Whlw,Yeb34-WH1R9mzsAfx9CQ5A,2.0,3,3,0,"I really wanted to like this place! I went about a year ago and had a bad experience. In the middle of the massage my massage therapist said she needed more oil and ran out leaving me laying there on the table. Another person came in about 5 minutes later and told me my therapist was not feeling good and she would continue in her place. At that point I was not relaxed and couldn't really enjoy the rest of it. In their defense, they did not make me pay for that massage and did apologize. 

So last week I decided to go again thinking that bad experience was a one off and that people get sick at odd times. So I made an appointment for 10 am and they ask that you go 15 mins early so you can start your massage on time. Well, they should make sure their therapists follow that rule too. I went at 9:45 but my therapist didnt arrive until 10:10. I was on the table at around 10:15 after rushing to complete the form and get unchanged. They did make sure to give me a few extra minutes for my massage so I got most of my hour but it was still not cool. Even worse was that my therapist must have smoked and reeked of stale smoke. I also think they take their own sheets and towels in from their home because they reeked of stale smoke too. I was forced to lay with my face smashed into a smelly towel for almost an hour. Speaking of being face down, I realized that my therapist never had me flip over to lay on my back. She also never massaged my feet but I was never that into foot massages. I feel like I only got a rushed and incomplete massage. She did a good job on my arms and legs but not enough pressure on my back...I could've told her to increase the pressure but I honestly just wanted it to be over. She was a very nice and I think I was one of her first clients...but I felt like it was a less than relaxing experience. As a matter of fact, I was more tense after. 

The positives were that I thought the rooms were nice with very relaxing music and dimmed lights. This really could have been a great experience but I don't think I will try for a 3rd massage there. Next time I will spend the extra money and go to a more professional place.",2013-02-25 01:50:25

I have been eating custard/concrete for a few years now... not continuously because that could probably kill you, the calorie counts on these things have to be through the roof! They must be or else I don't know how they pound so much delicious in.  I like all of the flavors I have tried, the All Shook Up is a go to, I like the Dottie (mint and chocolate, can't go wrong in my book) and last night I tried the Big Apple.  Take a piece of apple pie, blend in with custard, top with whipped cream, drop a spoon in and send out the order window. Pretty good.  

In the summer, or spring, or fall, there is no better place to go cool down on a warm night than Ted Drewes.  I find myself craving it, and sometimes more the idea of it than a specific flavor.  I just want to get there, wait in line and ponder my choice until I am forced into a decision at the window (this decision usually involves the word ""mini"" if at all possible.  Because I will eat the whole regular, but I probably shouldn't.  In fact I always swear I will only eat half and then take the other half back to my freezer. Sadly, it never happens that way.  The specialty ones are the real doozies on this front.  Only one size.  *Sigh* I guess I will have to only eat celery for the rest of the week *spoon to mouth*. 

Being from the east coast, there is a lot of debate about who originated the ""flip"".  Was it Dairy Queen or Ted Drewes?  Who cares? I like to see my ice cream flipped over. Period. It is quirky and fun, and kids love it... but DQ has nothing on this place.  It always feels like a chain, while TD always feels like a local source of fun and joy. In my opinion everyone should flip ice cream upside down before they serve it to me, but I will still come here when the real cravings hit.

But this time concrete was the secondary reason for our visit.  It was christmas tree pickin' time. Nothing seems more appropriate on a freezing cold night a few weeks before Xmas than getting a tree and a frozen treat.  Nothing better than bundling up to eat ice cream.  So, with a brief run through of the trees, and a short debate on needle length, smell and height, we got ourselves a tree.  My first St Louis christmas tree.  I have no idea if we underpaid or overpaid, and I really don't care.  I kind of love the idea that the parking lot of a place that is so crowded traffic has to stop around it right after a hot July Cardinal's game magically transforms itself into a place to be in December.  Its not the cut your own tree places of my childhood, but I am going to give it a close runner up.  

I love it.  I am not St Louis born or bred, but if I ever move away, this will be one of the places I miss.",2010-12-09 16:43:01

We were a little concerned about the typical long wait on a hot day to boot. However, the wait was about 30 minutes, outside there's a sitting area setup with comfy chairs and in the shade, alongside the outside bar and seating area overlooking the canal. However, there was quite a queue for the outside bar. We were seated inside (Thank Goodness, so hot outside) although they had quite a bit of outside seating under shade too. 
We ordered E. Sea Rider which served generous portions but first, our super attentive waitress, started us off with their infamous fresh-tasty Hushpuppies, hmmm. It could have been a meal itself.  We ordered the House Sangria during their happy hour, unfortunately, the drink was not that impressive and the one Tiki coconut drink we wanted was not available.  The waitress was on point with her recommendations, made sure we didn't go without drinks and, friendly.  The E. Sea Rider was Ok.  The grouper was out of this world. You can get fried or blackened. We ordered the blackened grouper, not over seasoned and perfectly done. In fact, I regret not ordering the Grouper sandwich meal. The E Sea Rider's  scallops and shrimps , unfortunately, wasn't that great. It wasn't bad but I've had better. The scallops texture was  rubber and flavorless,almost to the point that made one question if it was something else found in the grocery's frozen aisle by the fish sticks. The shrimp smelled like a wet rag hit it. The blackened Grouper was the selling point of this meal. Finally, for dessert, we had the Pineapple cake which was sinfully outstanding, flavorful, refreshing and not overdone with sweetness. Didn't even spike up the Hub's sugar. Yes, highly recommended. As busy as they were, definitely moving their inventory so I am sure it was fresh. I do feel it's worth a retry, definitely will go for the grouper sandwich next time, and perhaps give the shrimp and scallops a retry. 
Next door to the restaurant, they have a seafood market which they had a bit of everything from frog legs, alligator bites to the common fresh seafood choices. From what we saw, it looked locally sourced. It is nicely positioned at the end of the Sponge Docks so you can walk the town too. Also there's private free parking available but it's quite a tight fit. Overall the atmosphere pretty lively and a good time to be had.",2021-08-21 19:23:39
NCV9wfMDXceRTZsqQCKbtw,QczCdRxNPg08FGbrj9n0VA,U7zFOqnX0oxOl0pUglPazA,3.0,0,0,0,"This is a DRASTICALLY different review than the one that I started writing a few weeks ago. Yes, ""weeks ago,"" as I was so upset with Rodes that I started basically live blogging my experience. Full disclosure, it wasn't good. Communication with Rodes was beyond terrible. A literal week would go by, from the time I sent to an email, to when I had to call them to talk, because they still hadn't responded. It was constant. I would email.....then wait.......then wait......then call....then leave a message.....then wait......then wait.....then call again, and finally get someone. NUMEROUS times. I hadn't met the person that was supposed to be running the show. My concerns weren't being addressed. I was being told two different things by two different people. I was 99.9% over dealing with Rodes period.

But then came the day of the event. I finally met Alyssa, who was an absolute pleasure to interact with. Everything went off without a hitch, everything was as it should've been, and everyone had a great time. Given how the lead up to the event went, I was actually GOBSMACKED that nothing went wrong with the event itself. 

The blame for this thinking lies with Rodes itself. See, their contract is....let's call it ""aggressive."" There are pointed deadlines and stipulations, and it states in NO UNCERTAIN TERMS, that should things go belly up, its on YOU. There are NO refunds. There are NO exceptions. There is NO liability from Rodes. Either you have YOUR shit together, or you lose your massive chunk of change. Meanwhile, Alyssa and Kaila are actually VERY laid back (some would say, too much so...) and they didn't even stick to their own deadlines and contract parameters. I had to chase THEM down to make a payment, when the contract states that if payment is not made a certain day, you forfeit your day and deposit, etc, etc. I left email after email, voicemail after voicemail; even asked to meet IN PERSON to make the payment, and I was brushed off every time. I even questioned WHY Rodes would take on so much work if they didn't have the manpower to pull it off. 

But, like Michael Jordan in the 4th quarter, Rodes rose to the occasion. They were there on time, the menu was correct (and the food received rave reviews from my guests), the servers were pleasant and professional, and everything went off without a hitch. I went to Rodes that day, FULLY EXPECTING a fight because of some type of miscommunication, and I got nothing.

Rodes only gets 3 stars because it WAS so bad in the beginning. Seriously, if you had seen the draft before this, you would've thought Rodes killed my dog or something. I was LIVID at the lack of communication. And honestly, for a business that is based on customer service, it really is unacceptable. I'm not saying you need to write me back immediately, or even the next day, but if I email you about RENTING SOMETHING FROM YOU, I shouldn't have to email again a week later, then call, then CALL AGAIN A FEW DAYS LATER because you haven't gotten back to me. I would even have been ok with a ""we received your email and will get back to you shortly"" email, but even that didn't happen. Again, Alyssa and Kaila are SUPER nice, and were nothing but pleasant and helpful WHEN YOU FINALLY GOT THROUGH TO THEM, but they were like magic leprechauns in terms of how hard they were to catch. 

ANYWHO, the barn is VERY spacious and has that rustic, outdoorsy vibe. It has heat, which was turned on, and provided a perfect temp for our mid October event. As I mentioned, the catering (provided by Rodes as part of the contract) got rave reviews. I thought it was good, not great, but my guests really enjoyed it, and several remarked about how good the food was. Again, our servers were great (Roy and Cameron, I believe), and after checking in to make sure everything was ok, Alyssa got out of our hair to run the show as we saw fit. 

One issue that DID occur, was that during our event, a couple, with their child, walked into the barn, in the middle of our event. They said that they were thinking about renting the place themselves and wanted to look around. They were quickly asked (by us) to come back another time, as we were obviously using the place, but it did point out that there should be SOME kind of marking off, or ""event security"" or something to prevent that from happening. 

I don't see why I would ever use Rodes barn again, although several of my guests made notes to find out about having weddings there, but we did have a good time, despite the early hiccups. I would recommend the venue, and even the company, as long as you know that going in, communication is going to be a BIG issue. 

Our event (baby shower) for 60 people, BYOB, was a little over $2,000. Adjust your numbers accordingly.",2018-10-30 19:14:34

I selected this place after a quick glance at Yelp solely based on Yelp ratings and number of reviews without actually reading the reviews. I regretted it once seated but my group didn't want to go through the trouble of finding another place, but by the middle of our experience wished we had left sooner. We were provided with the limited lunch menu and everyone at our table was displeased with what was on the menu, that's what caused me to want to leave. No one was slightly interested on anything on that menu. All the good reviews for food seem to be based on breakfast. And although we saw the server with pancakes and other breakfast food, they insisted it was over though it didn't seem so. Why were we not provided a regular menu, at all? We had to borrow the menu of the other group in order to place our order.

The service was incredibly off. Our group was told we could be seated in two booths. However, the entire time treated us as two separate parties though it was their suggestion to seat us that way and although we talked to each other, took photos together, etc. 

There were about 3 other groups who received their food, including the table apart of our group. We only ordered simple items such as burgers and pizza. 

At some point they were informed we just got married, and the response was yeah, a lot of people do that this time of year. By the time our table finally received the food the other table had finished eating and was getting their bill. If it was just me, I would have left. It finally got to the point the other people at the table was on board, then they brought out the food. I wish they would have just let us leave...

Something as simple as a burger? Burnt on the outside, slightly pink on the inside. I would rather eat a bowl of cereal. Don't believe me? Check out my pictures. 

Coming here was just a huge mistake and a regret of mine, especially since it's the first place we went after getting married. The massive delay in service contributed to us being late for the wedding reception. I didn't even have time for makeup on my special day and it increased the amount of stress as well. I truly hate that they received any business from our large party and just hope that this review will discourage you from doing the same.",2015-04-21 12:36:41
k1Q1CDD8ZwgIW3vDU7LUjg,r22nYTmjyafy1YxhOMu_AA,7BQObhEOYhw5HUcmpNlFoQ,1.0,1,0,0,"I called Horizon Services because my heater ceased working, the tech should up early so I was happy about that. The tech checked the unit and went over it with his volt meter. He determined the transformer was bad and needed to be replaced. I was quoted 614$ for them to replace the part plus the service charge. If I signed up for the Service Partner plan they would waive the Service charge and the cost to replace the transformer would only cost 513$ + 99 for the Service Partner Plan. At this point it was a friday and no one else could make it out till the following day or later so I decided to go ahead and have them replace the transformer.
 The transformer was quickly replaced and wired in, the tech switched the circuit breaker on (the one in the air exchanger) and everything fired up. At that time we noticed a crackle noise coming from the circuit breaker. The tech then stated I needed to get that replaced as well, it was going to cost another 600$ for the heater kit. At that time I declined the service as I was going to get my normal HVAC guy to look into when he got back into town. So I paid and the tech left. Later I decided to look up the part the tech put in place. To my surprise the part can be purchased from my local hardware store for $31. So I Called to find out about the price and to determine what part of the service cost so much. I finally heard back from a manager the following monday and she stated its flat rate pricing and it is non-negotiable, I was told I would get $99 back for the service partner plan. 
 So I wasnt really happy but was going to be happy with getting $99 back and learning a life lesson. Well I get home Monday night and the heater was off again. I thought maybe I tripped the circuit breaker on the transformer the tech installed, but that was fine. I checked the breaker that we identified as being bad and found if I pushed it the unit kicked on, when I let go it kicked off. So I was able to push it a certain way and the heater would kick on and stay on, but this got me thinking, maybe the transformer wasnt bad to begin with. So I grabbed the old transformer and my volt meter and started testing it. Everything tested fine, so I Called my HVAC guy and he agreed with my findings. I called a local electrician and he also agreed with my findings. 
  So at this time I ordered the defective circuit breaker replacement and placed a call into Horizon to talk to a manager again. 
On Friday I still have not heard back from Horizon and my circuit breaker came in so I went down and wired in the new breaker and also reconnected the old transformer, the one they said was bad and charged 564.50$ to replace. Turned the main breaker back on and everything is working fine. So not only did they misdiagnose the problem, they replaced the wrong part and did not fix the original problem. I Called Horizon back Friday night only to be told there are not managers at night or on the weekend and then the girl answering the phone refused to give me her name and hung up on me.",2014-02-17 00:24:25

My family and I bought a Toyota matrix in 2004, brand spanking new and it's always been fairly loud when driving, my parents took it in 4 different times and what did they tell them? ""Oh that's just how the car sounds"". Once I took it to two independent service places i was told it was the bearings and that none of them were EVER properly oiled or installed correctly... 12 years and their techs are that inept at their own jobs. 

My current issue is that back in April,  I had to take my car in for a few recalls, during my exit when I picked up my paperwork I was told that they had removed my dash and messed with the wires, steering column, and everything else while installing the recalls. Recently I was made aware that my taillights were not working; the brake lights, flashers, hazards and everything else work though.  I never drive at night and only became aware because of the changing seasons, so I called and made an appointment to have it looked at, and that's where my latest debacle began. For one it took a week and a half to get that appointment (Even though this is obviously a serious issue and I told them I drive to work early in the morning, people need to be able to see me), second I couldn't get a promise that, even though it was more than likely their fault, that I would not be charged for a ""diagnostic test"". I had made sure to have no recent work done other than a serpentine belt I fixed earlier this week and I was aware of this issue for at least a month. So when I went in today I spoke with the manager Matt who swore up and down none of the recalls touched my steering column or my wires (but I have it on paper as well as the verbal statement I was given by the tech when I left in April) and whenever I would ask him a question, or make a statement he would not answer me, he would look straight at, and answer my boyfriend. I am the owner and care person of this car and my boyfriend has nothing to do with any of it so I ABSOLUTELY do not appreciate the presumption that my boyfriend needs to sign off on what I am saying when I am the one who makes the decisions about my transportation. Lastly I was told that if they ran a diagnostic and they didn't find fault with themselves I would be charged their fee off $99.95. This is the last and final time I will let Toyota treat me like ""some dumb girl"".

 Your customer service from your higher ups is terrible and your techs are below subpar at best. If it wasn't for your car sales you'd go out of business, I will NEVER set foot into your business again and will do all future car shopping at a different dealership. I have already started looking around and finding amazing, local repair people to work with in order to fix all of the damage from the neglect your company has provided myself and my family over the years. Thank you Reno Toyota for absolutely nothing except taking money from my pocket.",2016-09-25 01:43:35

The menu seems a bit cluttered, as there are numerous advertisements mixed in with the menu. If anything, it seems as though it a better layout could have been thought of. The menu prices are beyond fair for what's being offered. My husband and I ordered the jalapeno poppers, which were simply a delicious cheesy start. I won't say they are the best poppers I've had, but I was not disappointed. 

Now the burgers, that is a different story. From what I've been told, this place is like a staple for St. Petersburg, and it didn't live up to hype. For one, I felt the burgers could have been the same quality I would find if I picked up a pack of frozen burgers in the store, but whatever. If the burger tastes good, then that can be overlooked. The burger was a huge disappointment. When I eat a burger, one of my first assessments of it being good is if they simply seasoned the meat. Salt and pepper on beef can go a very long way. I am not one who believes that what goes on top of the burger takes the place of flavor. This burger was not seasoned, or if it was, I couldn't tell. 

Next, when I took a bit, all the juice (that probably held whatever flavor existed) dripped right onto my saucer fixed plate. And I have to nit pick about these plates. They are small, so when all this juice dripped onto my plate, making a bloody puddle, it forced me to have to just eat the burger without being able to put it down. If I had put it down, then what was left of my bun would have become fully soaked in the juice, and a soggy bun is gross!

I wanted to enjoy this cheap date night with my husband. When we first pulled up, one of the cooks in the back was so friendly, and waved hello. And as we were leaving, he thanked us for coming by, and really, that left us with a better impression of the customer service. Unfortunately, I can not say the same of burgers. I hate to say this, but I could've gone to Five Guys, and faired better.",2015-04-22 01:12:58
LX8SEFsNfhs2ZgBGooMieA,apVRy9eATjYFBMAaVoY0Dw,ZBL2sGJCI-oHHjwo17WWng,4.0,1,0,0,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel last week for a 5 day vacation. The staff was polite and the lobby/bar area was very nice. 

1) It was in a prime location! Very close to all the fun stuff.. Bourbon, Canal, Decatur, the French Quarter, the Mississippi River. Even the Garden District wasn't too far of a walk! 

2)The room was modern with a large comfy bed, large windows, plenty of lights, a ton of electrical outlets, as well as USB ports throughout the room. The floor was not carpeted, and I loved that about the room... It gave the room a much cleaner feel, as hotel carpets get quite gross. 

3) The bathroom was clean, and also quite modern. The shower had both a regular shower head,  as well as an overhead rain shower head. The hair dryer was great! Compared to other hotel dryers, this one was pretty awesome! 

4) the mini fridge had two bottles of water, available to us, free of charge. Additional bottles of water could be found in the workout room, and the ice dispensers dispensed water as well!

5) the gym was small but the equipment appeared rather new. (One of the treadmills was stuck in an elevated position, and would neither go up or down).

My Gripes:
1) the bathroom door consisted of two sliding doors which met in the middle. There was no lock, and they didn't quite close all the way so there was always an open crack between the doors. 

2) the closet was near non-existent. The in-room safe was located inside the small nook, which took up nearly 2/3 of the provided space. There was a robe hanging inside the small nook, along side the ironing board, and both needed to be removed in order to utilize the other 1/3 space. Other than a small drawer located under the safe, there were no drawers in the entire room.  

3) our room was serviced on a day that our ""do not disturb"" sign was up. We were quite surprised upon walking into the room, considering the sign was still on the outside of the door. The room stewardess threw away all of the plastic bags we intended to keep for packing reasons, along with a stack of clothing tags/receipts, and took all of the loose change we had on the desk.

4) while waiting to meet up with some friends, I asked the bartender to make me something fruity. She came back with a red drink, which looked delicious but it tasted like straight whiskey. I tried to milk the cocktail for the better part of 30 minutes until I finally gave up. I got about 1/5 of the way through it, before deciding it was unbearable. She never asked if I liked the drink, or checked on me thereafter, so I just paid the tab and left my near full drink on the bar. I don't typically have an issue downing a strong drink, but this I just couldn't manage... it was by no means fruity. 

I would stay here again. I think next time I'd ask for a bathroom door that closes and perhaps inquire about a room that offers more closet space.",2016-04-07 04:51:45
ANItqSebbeoBILkbRo4amA,79JCGOJwUkD7nKWx8cfGVg,l_slvEnh4v3W8BXF1gYlcQ,1.0,8,2,2,"Update #2: Of Mice and Men

After my original review, I was very nicely offered a gift certificate to come back and give the place another try (as a reminder, the first less than stellar review included an awkward moment where they were hesitant to let us in for drinks because we had come straight from work and were in 'uniform'). I wish for their sake they had left it at that...i can only lower my review after the second visit.

Myself and three friends went on a sunday morning to try out the endless mimosas and bloody mary bar. We planned on hanging out for a while so wanted to do breakfast/mimosas first and then move on to the bloody marys after. Makes sense? I mean this place is obviously built for getting deals on drinks...

The waitress seemed extremely confused about the rules for both of the above mentioned drink deals. It took a good while to get it sorted out. After breakfast was started (just fyi, they start the hour timer from when you ORDER, not from your first drink, which can be fairly far part), the continued to ask us every 10 mins or so if we were ready to start the mimosa bar. More just aggravating but unfortunately it gets worse.

Firstly we were sitting out of the main bar on the patio, not sure if this makes the next event ok or not, but there it is. Towards the end of our stay I happened to look down under the table and a mouse had been hanging about at our feet, and then ran away from the table and INTO the restaurant. Of couse, being a table full of girls everyone stood up quickly and backed away from the table. The waitress asked what had happened, we filled her in, she asked if we wanted to move to the other side, we said it wasnt worth it...does the right side of the building repel rodents?? Anyways, we're not AFRAID of mice...just would rather not have them hanging about where im eating...

I suppose word traveled and a couple other waiters came to look and see if they could see anything, asked where it had gone, we said INSIDE...but no one seemed to really care. IN FACT, one waiter/bartender/cook (not sure, male from inside the place) came out to tease us about being scared of mice...and told us he would be going inside to find it, cook it in the kitchen, and eat it. Cool! Great management skills. He made these jokes a couple more times before we left.  In the course of the movement a pillow had been found down on the ground, we didnt really want it back up cuz it had been near where the mouse probably had been. He then proceeded to pick it up and taunt one of my friends with it, rubbing it on her as she was trying to back away.

Needless to say, I will NOT be back ever of my own accord. I cant even go into detail about the general poor attitudes of the waitresses, the mouse incident takes precedence.

Too bad. Dont give people that complain a gift certificate...only gives them another chance to experience this stuff.",2013-04-19 04:32:57
_V4rwB38h_TBITxm8eyvEg,MPyZXKcUIbyFZdlTlXiDVQ,4szMVHmGXodrVGw4Zhev9g,1.0,3,0,0,"I honestly don't know how this spot is one of the best rated restaurants in Nashville. We must have had such a different experience then those who love this place. 

To start with know you are going to wait, we had a 45 minute wait which we didn't mind. The area this place is in has great shops to check out so we willed the time easily. We were sat all the way in the corner at a two top, we liked that we were kind of alone, pandemic and everything. What I absolutely hated about this table was now I was dripped on by air conditioner condensation every five minutes. It was gross, I told our server, he brought out a huge stick with a towel on the end. Multiple tables around us also complained. If this is such a big problem that you have this stick don't you think you should fix it!?!? Literally this water got on our food at one point. 

For the food itself, we went a little taco crazy, ordering five each. With such good reviews we wanted a little taste of everything. We suggest the Baja fish taco (who doesn't love a fried fish taco with a great spicy sauce), the spiced chicken verde taco (not crazy spicy, the only protein that wasn't so over cooked) and tuna tatako taco (comes in a lettuce wrap, very fresh and crisp). 

Do not suggest the cauliflower taco (the sauce made the cauliflower mush, this was the first taco I ate too and it was already a mush mess), the Chile-lime Shrimp taco (wasn't a pleasant spice, no lime taste and shrimp tasted off) or the glazed pork belly (was all fat, not worth it at all). 

Do order the spicy cucumber salad and the street corn. The best things we had! The corn was everything!! The quac could have been passed on, the salsa verde was very tasty though! Also loved how the girl who made the salsa verde was the girl who dropped it off. 

What really ticked me off about this place was the service though. After the air conditioning shit, one of the waiters came by and noticed we didn't eat the shrimp tacos, without asking he said he would remove it from the bill, he did not. He actually even came by later to say again he took it off. Didn't notice until I was at the hotel later that they never were. 

Would not suggest this place if your in Nashville. Such a sad experience.",2021-10-05 00:17:01
A5dXnv89dNfrIT--U5Y8Ng,I4M62stYqfrHESgrU-Bn-A,c-y_ORtoUTFDBXXRVqUehQ,4.0,0,0,0,"Another place I've come to recently (couple months ago) that I realize I never reviewed. Have only been here once so far and it was a good experience for me. Came in on a busy Friday night so there was a little bit of a wait for a table (there were open tables) but the hostesses were great while we were waiting. They would ask if we needed anything and were apologetic. Although the reason why we were waiting was because they were waiting for a server that could handle a party of 5 - I'm not sure if all the servers were not trained up very well or inexperienced maybe and that's why we had to wait for a server that could handle our large table of 5? All was okay though since we had to wait for the other 2 of our party to arrive anyway. 

While waiting we admired the decor and the feel of the place. The restaurant looks amazing and felt comfortable to be in. I liked that the servers were fairly casual in their uniforms, the furniture looked cozy, it just has a good feel to it. 

After we were seated, our server came up and greeted us within a few minutes and took our drink orders. Normally this would be straightforward, but apparently everything my wife wanted that night they were out of. They did not have her first choice in beer nor her second (both from local breweries). So she tried to order a cocktail since they have such a large selection of hard liquor on display. She tried to get a simple vodka/cranberry. The server came back with a huge smile of embarrassment to tell us that they did not have cranberry juice to make her drink. After the 3rd strike on drinks she just ordered a water but the server recommended a Saison that they had based off of what my wife was ordering. She is normally an IPA drinker and those were her choices in beer that they did not have. She decided to try the beer and wasn't a fan. I'm not sure if they did not have any other IPA's they could recommend or if he just didn't realize that that was what she was trying to order, but she didn't want to keep playing the guessing game to see what they had so she accepted his recommendation.

Finally, to the food. There were many things on the menu that sounded delicious. I had lamb and my wife did their mac and cheese. The lamb was very good, tender, and the sauce over it went perfect with the meal. I've heard they recently changed up their menu so I'm not sure if this is still an option but if it is I would recommend this dish.  My wife enjoyed the mac and cheese but she said that it was a little too rich for her. She's not sure if she would do that specific dish again just for that reason.

The service was great minus the mishap with the drinks. Our server was attentive without hovering, humorous, and pleasant. He did a great job dealing with the drink issue although it would have been nice if they had comped my wife's drink since it was far from what she actually wanted and they did not have anything else she tried to get. He would engage is in small talk, joke with us, and make sure we were taken care of. 

Overall, it was a good experience. We had fun and will go again to try some other food items on the menu.",2015-05-05 18:57:04
cv0vOw782NHEi_IUelLv8Q,ydakqMFCPLbr9cWGpLlNew,q2rR-v9ZStix89t7ihyuqg,2.0,3,1,0,"After a few weeks of watching and waiting for the New Tacos Circus location to open, we finally made it down.  Initially we were told it would be a 45 minute wait and we sat on picnic tables out on the patio which were for overflow.  We didn't mind waiting because we'd had great experiences at the previous tiny location.  It ended up being about an hour before we got seated.

First I want to say the patio area is pretty cool, multi-tiered and lots of room to soak in a great fall evening of chips, drinks and merry making.  We we seated in the overflow dining room however, and my overall impression of the place was...dark and loud.  The bar seating area has lights over each table and but is still very dim, but the dining room area is so dark it was difficult to see the food on our plates!  It was crazy!!!  Check my photos and you'll see that we were basically eating in the dark.  I know they had a break in right before opening, did they steal the light fixtures???  Additionally, it was so loud you had to basically yell across the table to maintain a conversation.  It couldn't hurt to turn the club music down a few notches.  It was like we were eating in a jersey shore club.  GTL!

Ok, so food, the reason we came in the first place.  The chips we good, I like a good full bodied chip but the salsa was really thin and runny.  It is not the typical semi chunky stuff that you may be accustomed to at most Mexican places.  It had an ok taste but it's so thin and runny if you tried to get a nice little pile to stay on your chip then you just ended up slinging it all over the table, which I did.  Frustrating.  

We started with the cardinal queso, which was good.  A ginourmous bowl of queso with beef, beans and pico.  After waiting so long we devoured it, but while eating it we both felt it very similar to velveeta chili cheese dip.  

We ordered the large plate tacos with the 3 meats, chicken, carnitas and skirt steak- and the Mexican Flag burrito.  I think we had mixed feelings on all of it.  The carnitas and chicken were pretty good, had great flavor and super tender.  The skirt steak tasted good and was seasoned well but was really chewy.  The tortillas they brought for the tacos, which I think started off fresh at some point- look and tasted like they'd been cooked and sat for a prolonged period so the edges could all get hard and chewy.  Like a rawhide bone.  What I loved the most about the tacos: the shaved radishes to top them.  I liked the carrots in the rice, but then the rice had almost no flavor.

My wife got the burrito and reported that it was bland, and everything seemed to need salt.  Everything on my tacos plate needed salt too.  Her burrito was the carnitas and reported that although it was tender it was lacking flavor.  In fact she didn't even eat half the burrito or sides that came with it.  Didn't even want to take it home.  That's what I consider a bad sign, when you don't want to take your leftovers home.  

Service was...opening few weeks so I know kinks are getting worked out but our waitress walked by at least half a dozen times passing my empty drink cup.  I almost took my glass to the bar to ask them to refill it myself.  It also took a very long time for food to arrive once we got seated.  From the time we got there to the time we left we're probably talking almost 2 hours.  The only world where that acceptable is where the food is out of this world, and is wasn't even close.

I know we went in with lofty expectations because we'd have great experiences at the old location but even the food tasted and felt different than it did before.  This is not the same Taco Circus.

Would I go back?  Maybe a year later once they've got their new setup in check, and there was no wait- yes.  But for now, it's a pass.",2019-09-23 00:58:39
qsRdySEfV0-HkBQ-yWx66A,59fImKVliKIEaUmNBQv01w,P32kIN7x4ALH_TfWAfmfug,1.0,15,3,0,"Where to begin?  I
have never experienced such a lack of professionalism and competency in my
life.  Let me start by drawing your
attention to my fiancé's face at 24 hours post facial. For someone who has
clear and even skin complexion, you can see why it is alarming to have this
type of result from a facial. The blisters and sores were both painful and
unsightly. She was asked by multiple employees in her workplace, ""what
happened to your skin?""  Mind you,
this is after she put on every possible makeup product to cover it up that was
available.  Thank God we have medical professionals in my family that instructed her to put hydro-cortisone cream on it.

Fast forward to the interaction that her and I both had
with the office staff, manager, and owners of Essentials. I have no idea where
this rag tag team of misfits was assembled, but it wasn't at a customer service
skill building workshop. The office staff is rude, unwelcoming, and unprofessional in appearance.  When she called to voice her concerns at the hack job facial, she was told that the ""manager"", Melissa would return her call shortly.  Melissa instructed her to drive to the salon (one hour away) and let the same cosmetologist who botched her facial, examine her and prescribe a course of action.  What kind of sense does that make?  When she expressed her inability and unwillingness to drive in person to the salon, Melissa requested that she email pictures of her face, which my fiancé gladly did.  She was told an owner would get back to her at some point, but was out of town that day.  The simple solution would have been to offer a refund of the cost of the facial, and ask what could be done to keep us as customers.  That did not happen.

Kim Didona, half of the ownership of Essentials Brandon, did end up calling my fiancé at 430 later that day.  This is where my warning to all considering services at Essentials comes into focus.  She started the phone call by telling my fiancé that her face looked perfectly normal.  She then said that she would absolutely not refund any of her money.  She then offered to, ""make it right"" by requiring my fiancé to come in person and have yet another treatment on her blistered, broken out, and damaged skin.  She then raised her voice and yelled at my fiance when she requested that she just wanted a refund and an apology.  Rightfully upset, I then called Kim myself to clear up some things from the formerly mentioned conversation.  I have dealt with a lot of people who are rough around the edges and difficult, but Kim sets herself apart.  I have never had anyone, much less the owner of a business, speak in a manner in which Kim spoke to me.  She argued with me over the legitimacy of our concerns, said that she would not consider a refund, said that there was absolutely nothing wrong with my fiancé's skin, nothing wrong with the way we were treated by her office staff, and that it was us who were being unreasonable.  Mind you, the entire conversation, she was yelling and talking over me.  As a customer, it should not matter how justified a concern is...it should be handled with the age old adage of a ""customer is always right"".  She ended the conversation by telling me that we were obviously not able to be made happy, that she was not going to tolerate my attitude, and that there was nothing else she had to say in the matter.  
Later that day, Kim's husband, Joe Didona did reach out and leave a voice message on my fiancé's phone.  While I am sure it is an olive branch extended upon his knowledge of how his wife mishandled the situation, it came too late.  The damage had been done both literally and figuratively and as I promised to Kim, I will make it a point to inform everyone that I can of the experience that we had at her place of business.

I am writing this review with 100% accuracy and utter honesty.  I hope that I can spare someone the waste of time, pain, skin damage, and stress of interacting with these people.  I have rarely found the notion of ""you get what you pay for"" to be false, and I can attest to its relevance in this situation.  Essentials of Brandon is a discount spa and it is more than evident that the discount is passed on to customers in both lack of service and incompetency of employees/owners.

HfkvkWIzPWVbOJ2lJBQkuQ,47oIw-CN1guUKx2_vUdsgw,a3bZJ-XVjDLS6cs5VuEFOg,5.0,13,12,7,"I'm not going to lie: much like the rest of St. Louis (the meat-eating, BBQ loving population, anyway), I've been drinking the Pappy's Koolaid. And I've been on the Bogart's love train. Can you really blame me? For as long as both establishments have been around, they've been practically shoved in my face and forced down my throat. Not that that's a BAD thing, mind you; they both make killer barbecue. KILLER.

But...a little part of me has always wondered if Pappy's and Bogart's really represented the best of what St. Louis has to offer. 

So I forced myself out of the box to find out. 

I've heard about Roper's before. Whether it was by word of mouth, Yelp reviews, or hearing about how they won the 'Best BBQ' prize from Steve Harvey's ""Hoodie"" awards, they've always kind of floated around in my head. I was excited to finally give them a try.

I heeded the advice of my fellow Yelpers and called my order in ahead. I kept it simple and just ordered a half rack of baby back ribs, along with a side of potato salad. 

I live about 30 minutes away, and that's how long they said it would take for my order to be ready. Perfect. 

I arrived and was rather shocked at how small Roper's was. There is literally nowhere to sit, so be prepared to take your order to go. 

Speaking of to go orders, my food was ready when I arrived. I paid, walked to my car (park on the street, as there's no parking lot), and went to town. I couldn't help myself, and I certainly didn't want to wait until I got home to dig into this. 

These ribs are FANTASTIC. They're super tender, super meaty, super smoky, and the barbecue sauce is like nothing I've ever had before. It's thick, hearty, savory, sweet, spicy...it's got a little bit of everything going on, and it ALL WORKS. It's messy. Be prepared. 

I don't know what else to say about these ribs other than the fact that they might be the best ribs I've ever eaten in my life. IN MY LIFE, y'all! 

I'm going to be honest. Roper's is in Jennings. If you're not familiar with this area of St. Louis, you should be aware that this isn't Ladue, Town & Country, or Chesterfield. In other words, if you're used to lily-white Leave It To Beaver-esque neighborhoods, you will probably think Jennings is ""sketchy"". If being in a neighborhood that's mostly black scares you, you'll probably think Jennings is ""sketchy"". If being surrounded by buildings that have seen better days intimidates you, you'll probably think Jennings is ""sketchy"". 

However, if you're after some fantastic barbecue and are willing to step out of your comfort zone? Roper's is IT. Put on your big boy (or big girl) panties, drive to Jennings, and get ready to have your mind blown. 

It's totally worth it. Pappy who?",2012-09-17 22:02:39
PREaEa8V6Aa8fek-N50zFw,Sy1LuBsTJlfteoALIh-dFQ,O5gyb_KBlLQgt4aEWkmjUA,1.0,8,1,0,"I'm responding to the owner's response and updating to 1 star from my original for many reasons. First, I was contacted by the owner who accused me of lying in my review. Mostly because I made my review nearly a year after the negative experience. I don't believe there is a statute on when you can voice on Yelp and the experience absolutely stuck with me because of multiple interactions and communication with the rep and the way it was left so I'm positive I have the right company in this review and am astounded at the accusation. I guess I'm only sorry I didn't review the day it happened when I was really upset so it would be considered valid.   Secondly, I made the review later because we have received wonderful experiences from other companies recently and I believe this company and consumers should be aware that service is above and beyond elsewhere.   I'm not trying to have a battle with anyone on this, but this was the actual experience so take what you'd like from it. I will address the other items from the response I received so I can best clarify my original review. 

Next, I was advised just recently by the owner that my review doesn't line up because this company does not do ""curbing"" or ""edging"" and it is sourced to a 3rd party contractor so they wouldn't have quoted me for that. I find that very interesting because we were measured by the rep for a 6 inch wide/ 12 inch high border along the front of our house for flower beds. I specifically recall this because Byron (rep) asked me how big I wanted the curbing and I said let's do a similar size to the current brick edging we have and we measured with my personal measuring tape.  He drew it in a sketch that I have documentation of edging from a copy of his drawing that was sent to me. 
Also - during the follow up appointment to measure for more edging to be done around a tree out front was never once relayed that this was a 3rd party contractor. It was at this point that the rep said he would have to redraw everything if we wanted curbing around the tree and he wasn't willing to do that and it would cause our cost to jump excessively from the initial indication, which is why I stated the quote was nearly 10K- as we were advised by the rep who said to add the extra edging our cost would be closer to 10K.  I ALSO emailed the rep and his manager with a copy of his drawing and said we wanted clarification on how the walkway would be poured because the drawing from the rep was not as we expected or discussed. It was at this point we said we wouldn't move forward unless we could review that and get on the same page and we were happy to do so.  These interactions were all BEFORE a manager was scheduled to come out and review finalities. 

Finally, the owner states that their rep would never tell a customer to send in their own measurements. I agree that they shouldn't ever, but I'm telling you he did so I don't have more proof then that and that I thought it was inappropriate that he told me to do so when he'd taken all the time to actually measure. The rep was ignorant towards us, said he wouldn't redo or change anything and that we should just ""send our measurements in.""  We told him we were done working with him at that point and he threw his hands up and stormed off saying, ""I don't have time for this.""  Later his manager called my phone and asked if the rep had injured his hand at our home during the meeting, to which we said no, he was there all of 5 min, got upset and left. We followed up with our email expressing our lack of confidence in the job and declining to move forward.  

So that is the experience we had, it was not top notch service and again and I'm glad I spoke up, regardless of how long it took me to do so should not be a factor to the ill experience. Glad others have been able to have good service, guess we had a rep who had a bad day. Honestly, I'm a really easy going person to work with, I don't like making negative reviews, we weren't trying to be difficult. Up until the last interaction we were excited to proceed on and were ready to pick a color for the concrete, it wasn't until we had requested the additional curbing/edging around the tree and asked to go over the design of the walkway did it all get so odd and negative.",2016-05-24 22:58:16
V6ruhV5FCahBzgzX0uGHtQ,aMVId5teg0xWSOrONgCIXg,fukyipAsR4LKSQz_uKV3nw,1.0,5,1,0,"As everyone says this place is truly hell on earth and no doubt the worst DMV in America. This is literally a cliche of a cliche DMV experience. Never have I seen people with so little power act and feel so powerful. For over FIVE HOURS I sat and watched them disrespect every single person they spoke to. It took an entire day here to do what several other states (including overpopulated California) have repeatedly accomplished for me in under 2 hours: transfer an out of state license.  Here's a list of just some of the abhorrent behavior I witnessed from the staff. 

-Took 90 minutes to call people to the counter for ""check in"" even though everyone has to check in at a touch screen upon arrival. 
-All ten employees left for lunch at the exact same time leaving an entire waiting room sitting for an hour. 
-Bryan, who appeared to be the manager, kept shouting and snapping his fingers at people like an angry lunch lady and repeatedly announced to the whole room that he didn't care how long we were there or if they would have time to get to us. 
-At 1 pm they unplugged the check in machines and placed ""broken"" signs on them. They then turned away anyone who walked in despite the fact that they close at 5pm and there were only about 40 people waiting. 
- They repeatedly claimed that a passport is required to get an ID which is simply untrue (a birth certificate can be used).  
-employees frequently snickered after sending someone away for a minor technicality. 
-They displayed outright disrespect for military service and refused to put ""veteran"" on my wife's license as well as another veteran there because apparently a military ID and discharge paperwork doesn't  prove you're a veteran in good ol' Tennessee. The employees actually seemed to treat veterans with more contempt than everyone else and never once showed them any gratitude or respect for their years of service. 
- Several times there were 45 minute breaks of silence between each person they called up.  
-After a four and a half hour wait the employee I dealt with mixed up my middle, first, and last name on my ID TWICE. 
-I had to take three pictures because the guy messed up the details on my ID so many times. 
-For almost forty minutes I stood and waited as the man pretended my passport couldn't be verified in the system. 
-the man repeatedly asked me if I was wearing contacts despite the fact that I'd told him no at least three times before just ignoring the question. The woman who did my wife's test made her keep her reading glasses on for her photo and put ""requires glasses"" on her license despite the fact that she passed the eye test without glasses and hardly ever wears them outside of five hour waiting room visits where there is nothing to do but read. 

 I highly suspect this experience is the way it is because Tennessee requires an ID to vote and obviously taking a day off work to go through this hell convinces many people to just leave without an ID and therefore never be able to vote. Nashville should be absolutely ashamed of this place and the behavior of their employees. The complete lack of human decency they display certainly made me ashamed to have moved here. The only saving grace was all the people in the waiting room who repeatedly showed kindness to each other throughout the day despite their unfortunate circumstances.",2019-06-27 21:34:20
p6VZrdhK_PQaieaoH_d-zg,neIGyNE_GNKeUGjqz50MAQ,8qjwSvjmjipiWt9YmQhoNg,1.0,41,3,1,"I had lasik at Kremer almost one year ago. I basically have had chronic eye pain, focusing problems/trouble reading and overall degraded quality of vision that is not correctable with glasses or any kind of further treatment. I know I'm not the only one. I hadn't heard of this case before going to kremer. This woman was a patient of Dr. Kremer years ago:

http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2001-06-28-lasik.htm
Angel Bin Fang was awarded $800,000 in her lawsuit against Kremer Laser Eye Center in King of Prussia, Pa. She says the first surgery left her farsighted in one eye. A second operation led to permanent double vision and other problems. The case is under appeal.

She can read for only 15 minutes at a time because of pain, she says. She can't play Ping-Pong, peruse a menu in a dimly lit restaurant, read road signs at night or spend any sustained period of time watching TV or movies, she says. ""It's constant. It will always be like this,"" she says. ""It's impacted everything in my daily life.""

TLC owns Kremer. Lasik attorney describes TLC's bad business model:

Federal class action lawsuit filed against TLC in March
http://www.wyff4.com/r/22881857/detail.html

Not long after I had lasik, former FDA official Morris Waxler started speaking out about how lax the FDA was in the approval process of the procedure, given it's high incidence of complications.
http://www.lasiknewswire.com/2009/09/former-fda-official-says-fda-screwed-up-in-approving-lasik.html

From the same article:
FDA said it ""has not approved retreatment for any LASIK device. Furthermore, FDA's labeling typically contains the following precaution: 'It is unknown whether LASIK is safe and effective for retreatment with this laser for LASIK, because it is unknown whether LASIK is safe and effective for repeating the LASIK procedure on the same eye.' ( They call this a ""touch up"" at Kremer. My advice would be to stay away from any doctor who refers to surgery as a touch up. Wish I had.)

My experience of the optometrists that participate in screeing patients and aftercare is overall pretty bad. I now realize how unqualified they are to be dealing with surgery patients. I think it's easier for someone without complications to be more unaware of this problem.  My feeling is they don't like to learn from problems. I was  treated with a dismissive attitude and denial of my problems at follow up appointments.

Also, the difference between the all laser lasik and the kind using a blade to create the flap is more than just price. Anyone interested should look into the 510(k) process used to approve the all laser.

KvJJn9h1L9vGoooAf8xprQ,TDQuFUn2r9_AWnzTj-Mh8Q,KXecZki-_3N7afs6HKWM3A,4.0,2,0,2,"Third visit to Ichichoro so I figured it's about time I left a review! I'd say this place is a solid 4.5 stars. This was the first place I've ever tried ramen and it took the second visit here for ramen in general to grow on me. I was just so accustomed to Vietnamese pho noodle soup  and impartial to pho. But now my eyes are opened! Ichi as I like to call them, does not  take reservations but currently they use the ""no wait"" app where you can put your name on their waitlist. Last time I went was this past Thursday, and  I used the app  which told me to be there at 8:11 and I got seated at 8:30ish. So I still had to wait but only like 20 mins extra. Every time I've gone Thursday and Fridays it's been a long wait, (but not for me!) so be wise and put your name on waitlist before you arrive. They hold the table 15 mins after your table is ready. 

Cocktails are 10 dollars, well crafted but small servings I think. The list  of speciality cocktails changes a little each time I've visited. My first visit 8i tried their spicy  jalapeño margaritaesque  drink.  It  gave me too strong of an afterburn, very concentrated. I would have liked it better if I was not having hot broth at the same time because usually I like the spice. I also tried their purple drop cocktail (sake, ginger, casis and lime), this is currently featured. Also their ever changing  blend of sangria, although small for the price is also delicious and unique, I think  they  add sake to it. I tried the current sangria and really liked it. I didn't know sake could make such good tasting cocktails! 

Last visit was the first time I'd gone in the summer months. Whooo! It is hot inside the dining area and right by the bar. The bar area, is like an outdoor indoor space. Where there are openings that let the outside  heat in despite the AC. I've sat right by the kitchen against the wall before and don't recall sweating so profusely as I did last time. During the meal I had to put my hair up. Hard  to find parking at the restaurant.  Only 4/5 spots and at least 1 is handicap space. There is an adjacent parking lot but only a couple spots marked for Ichichoro.

I'm  a fan of their popcorn fried chicken app called Karaage"" very crisp but  has meaty chunks at the same time. The steamed buns are worth a try if you like steamed buns. On our second visit, my boyfriend and I decided to eat some snacks and share a ramen. This left us comfortably full and not feeling  like we overate by finishing the entire big bowl of  ramen. 

My favorite broths at Ichichoro are the miso pork broth and spicy kimushi/ kimchi . Kimchi flavor is not overpowering and perfect combo of heat and tang. I usually hate miso soup, so i was surprised I liked this broth.  I noticed in the miso ramen  you tend to get a lot of broth and looks like bigger portion since the main protein is just ground pork but in the Tonkotsu ramen which is 14 dollars (pork broth with pork belly), it's a lighter tasting broth  and smaller portion. Smaller amount of  broth compared to miso. You can add porkbelly or additional toppings like seasoned egg, poach egg, applewood bacon, shrimp for 3 dollars extra to any ramen. There's also other additions for 2 dollars each like toasted seaweed, chicharones, bamboo shoots etc. Best not to get too carried away tho, I'd say only add 1-2 things extra so that you can enjoy the ramen. Ichi did a pretty good job already of combining the right type and  number of ingredients in one bowl per their menu. It's like when someone orders pizza and instead of 2-3 toppings, they do almost all the toppings available and sometimes putting too much toppings makes an amazing pizza taste blah and just too heavy n mushy. I always warn my boyfriend of this but he never listens and then later regrets it!

The ramens at ichi stand out because you can tell there is such attention to details when constructing the components. It's not just about the broth and noodles. Black truffle butter used in some of the ramens   is a show stopper. I like that since the time Ichi opened they've reworked and tweaked a lot of their menu items. Definitely  worth a try once  especially if you never had ramen! This is the place to go!",2017-07-13 02:44:01
2Hu07_1rkbHRe35zhnThBg,5fugkN7AwqdK0-8WfvBC3Q,bzjOYERJv5YwW6Q8lUBcJw,4.0,2,0,0,"Overall, we really like Costco.

Pros:
-- They have a ton of healthier or natural foods.  I personally don't buy into the organic marketing hype, but the natural peanut butters, etc. are great.  Many times you also have identical options in lower sodium varieties directly next to the regular sodium product (e.g. cashews, bacon).
-- Their monthly sale items are great.  When they put something on sale, they don't just take off a few pennies.  They price it so you can't beat that item at Sams or Amazon.
-- They don't flood you with the cheap unhealthy typical boxed meals.  I don't care if I can buy processed ramen noodles or macaroni and cheese by the case.  I have Walmart or Sams for that stuff.
-- Alcohol -- They don't just carry one item all year long.  They had three different types of Oktoberfest or seasonal beers.  Their selection is reason enough to shop there.
-- In house brands of harder to find bulk items.  They are one of the only places I know who has a generic brand of Greek yogurt in bulk.
-- Fuel prices -- Very competitive fuel prices.
-- Location -- It's easy to get on and off the interstate right at the store.  There is no need to drive through a convoluted mess of New Orleans pothole streets to get to and from the location.  This is really good if you don't live in the city itself.

Cons:
-- Workers -- I understand they hire local, and I applaud Costco for that, but this group is just bad.  If you need to ask anyone a question regarding the products in the store, you can hang it up.  It took 5 workers to get our account information entered in their system, and they still got it wrong.  If you only have one task, and you botch that, what can you say.  It's also like some of them are learning how to be polite for the first time.
-- Price Variance -- You have to pay attention closely as some items are significantly more than Sams.  It's not many, but on some of their meats, for example, they are a few dollars higher.  I held off on ground turkey simply because the same product was a few dollars higher at Costco.
-- Food Court -- I guess this partially goes back to the workers again.  I asked the folks behind the counter for the timing on our pizza, and they kept saying not yet.  Finally, my wife went to a different window to ask another person directly, and they were able to grab the pizza off the warmer.  It had been sitting there for 15 minutes, and I even asked one of the others if that specifically was mine.  As for the food, the pizza was more bland than a microwave pizza.  The Walmart and Sams pizzas are much better.  They also have no salt available in the food court.  It is truly bare minimum here.  At least it's sorta cheap.

All in all, it's definitely worth going.  I can easily overlook their social views for the products they provide.  As long as the place and customers stay clean, this is an excellent place to shop.  I can understand Costco's position with employees, and I hope the higher local wage rate keeps the place at least like it is now.  I've been a fan of Costco for a long time, but never had one local.  Thanks, Costco!",2013-10-27 14:55:48

My name is Mirna GIddings
I have an issue with one of your managers in Reno Nevada. Her name is Julia, 
today I went to visit your Location with my son and husband on my lunch break, 5:40 pm.  when we got there we made our orders as usual during happy hour. when we where done eating i asked for the check and i told the waiter to help me with my points on my rewards account. I've been a loyal costumer since i started working at dillards 3 years ago and before that, with my dad. He loves your restaurant. So every birthday or just because we go to BJ's because he wants to go but always at the sparks location since it is so close to our house.  The waitress  asked for the name under my account, MACIGKR and when she cameback I told her that I work for dillards and dillards is in the mall  and we always get a 10% discount.  She told me. ""let me ask my manger."" The waitress came back about 10 minutes later and responds. ""my manger said we cant give you both disounts, its either the happy hour discount or the 10% for working in the mall."" I was surprised because this is not the first time I've been there during happy hour. i always get my discount 10% off as well as happpy hour. I asked the waitress to call the manager.? she did and i told her the same thing cause most of the people that we work with from dillards  go there and eat during happy hour.  The make up department, women's  shoes, and even the store managers come with us sometimes, and we've never had  such hard time getting the 10% off. She yelled at me in front of other costumers and had most of the people look at us because she was raising her voice, I feel very embarrassed. When i got back to my job i saw some of my co-workers and i ask them remember when we where going to bjs.? These guys told me yes! i ask him are you getting 10% off on your check or just the happy hour,? he respond me both no matter what we work for the mall.. huh.. I explained to him about the 10% off and i  also explained the situation and he tells me that it's not right.. and he actually spends more money there than me! I feel very upset with your manager, how she resolved the situation, or didn't. On top of everything, she never added my points to my reward. I think she has to respect all costumers in general, instead she made a scene in front of other costumers thats not professional. i go to to all the restaurants in the mall and never have a problem, even with your restaurant. I hope to see my points very soon. i may stop there for awhile and warren my friends or (co-workers) so we can put a halt on business till the problem is solved. i will probably let the discount go, but i will not tolerate rude behavior coming from a manager!
thanks for your attention.",2016-10-11 07:06:31

The good: Variety of rides, fast ones, slow ones. A good size park where you can ride very single ride in one day and repeat your favorites. The 3 pools are probably the best thing in there, parents can just sit back sun tan or sit in the water and let the kiddos run around. Rides are safe (except the wooden coaster, simply put: stay away), staff is extremely friendly. They pretty much let the kids have as much fun as they can but if someone gets out of line then they escort him out. I saw this happen in one ride, the kid was jumping during the slide. Also season pass prices are cheap as long as you take advantage of them and go at least 3-4 times. They even have some dry rides for little ones. My 1 year old had a blast! Bathrooms were clean. Season passes comes with coupon book with a few free things like tickets to ballparks. Also comes with a .99 cent refill bottle. 

The bad: Maintenance could be better. I work in maintenance so my eye goes straight for it. I really hope management sees this part of the review. Season pass registration room is a very small room with like 40 people inside. Doors always opening and closing and the room has a window air conditioner unit which was doing nothing. I took it upon myself to pop the filter out and behold there was like 2 pounds of dirt on the filter. NEVER BEEN CLEANED BEFORE. I mean come on maintenance!!!!!!!! I cleaned it with my own hands and banged it on the floor under a table. The a/c was much colder after that and the air was safe for my kids to breath. The black tube water ride looks like its never been cleaned on the outside. Some features of certain rides were not working correctly. A few other minor things I can't remember right now.

We were unable to take in food for my 1 yr old. He can eat a variety of foods but on a day of running around and burning energy I want him to eat something healthy not a pizza.

Overall: We have a great time every time we go, I recommend it to everyone and bring my family along when we go.",2015-06-09 16:54:37

We walked in and the manager was a bit grumpy after we kindly asked not to sit in the bar (we feel like it's a waste since we don't drink). He walked away to a table without saying anything, such as ""follow me."" Awkward.... Our waitress, Lydia, came by. She ended up being VERY sweet (I would give her service alone 5 stars). We ordered and she was prompt with drinks and rolls. Sadly the rolls were hard...bummer. Our salads came shortly after. I immediately noticed all the brown pieces but thought I could just pick them out. Nope! 90% of the lettuce was brown. Lydia apologized; she said the entree salads have fresher lettuce in a big bin (no idea why all salads don't come from the fresh bunch...). Our food came out and while mine looked great (minus the random several slices of raw onion as garnish, haha), my husband's medium well steak came out in a pool of blood. He was able to send it back to be re-cooked but his chicken tenders were soaked in it. My honey fried chicken was great but the sweet potato mash was another story. It had a really off-putting taste, almost like it had gone bad, and it was cold. I tried to not complain and just deal but then I began finding big black pieces. I put them on my plate, rinsed them with water, and couldn't quite tell what they were but they resembled good size rocks (about the size of a finger tip). Appetite. Gone. Lydia came by, she was mortified. She kept apologizing, poor thing, not her fault! When she returned later with our check, she said the manager told her they were ""potato roots"" that were perfectly safe to eat. Yeah...let's see that guy eat them then. She also said she begged him for a discount (she got me half off my meal, but why does a server need to beg a manager for a discount?). The manager kept walking around, he stared at people (including us several times) but never checked on anyone and never came to apologize for our bad food experience. Lydia asked us to come back and give them another chance. We declined. This is not the first time food has been less than great (although it's never been THIS bad) so we give up.

SjjgexsWqRXcbYwtnDM1tg,kkNFDL_bfM4BP65UEaDs_w,qkckth-7yHPXqWwaS6ovKA,3.0,2,1,2,"Thought I'd reviewed this in the past, but I don't see it now. Hadn't eaten here in quite awhile, until last night. Have usually had good dining experiences here, with a variety of entrees. Last night was different. 
      There used to be a valet, not that I'd ever used it before, but I would have last night! It was like ten minutes of circling the restaurant before we were able to park! About 5-10 other cars circling (some would give up) as well.
       My husband had gone in while I attempted to park, so he managed to snag a table that I suppose was technically in the bar area. That whole room is normally filled with tables, but not this time. For some reason the floor was wide open and empty...??? So, that was odd, as people stood around needing a table. 
      Service started off strong, but fairly quickly went downhill. The chips came quickly, plus our first round of drinks (ONLY round, as she then deserted us). The chips are the saving grace of this place. We all LOVE those thin, crispy chips, the seasoning on them, and the ranch, guacamole and salsa! 
     In warmer months, the patio is a big draw as well. But, it was closed last night. Why not invest in some outdoor heaters? Lots of restaurants do that for this time of year. It's not freezing yet. Maybe they think it's good to have cars circling the lot, and people standing around waiting rather than seated and spending money? It's not.
      All three of our meals were lukewarm. Mine was cheese enchiladas. Let me tell you, I make enchiladas, and those weren't enchiladas. She asked what type of sauce I wanted on top...I asked for it on the side rather than On top since I wasn't sure about the spice level. So, what I got was 2 dry tortillas rolled around some cheese and nuked...cheese hardened where it oozed out of the ends.  not even a lot of cheese...and lukewarm, so the cheese was just a glob.  less than desirable. 
      My sangria was tasty, but no actual fruit in it. Also, not for sure there was any alcohol in it, and I think it was pretty small. But, maybe that's just because she never came around to get me another one, and she didn't give us water.
     So, obviously this dining experience wasn't even a 3, but WE LOVE THE CHIPS and for that alone I give it three stars.",2016-11-11 22:18:33
JUaDcjA_dSRc76Fu_KY6VQ,oeFiWvoOG0hpMOXXxblfyQ,gJSNa1bxwtY0dm1t-dh38w,3.0,5,2,1,"I came here for my Birthday because I figured that one day I should go to PF Changs to at least bitch about it.  The place is actually not that bad at all, if you order the right items.  We arrived right when they opened on a Saturday, but within an hour the place was jammed packed.  So, if you are coming a little later, then I highly recommend making a reservation.

PF's is Asian fusion, specifically Chinese.  However, there are a few items that you would consider Japanese in influence.  They should really consider making their employees watch a video on how to eat and serve Chinese food, because the waitress was laughing at my husband for eating his food out of the rice bowl in hand.  That is how many Asian countries eat their food, not letting it run all over a plate that is two feet from their face and fighting with chopsticks on a flat surface.  The mounds of Chinese food on a plate thing is totally American.  

First off- the only thing that is keeping me from hating this place is their understanding and use of wok hai (wok breath), where the wok cooked food is actually cooked properly and has a slight char.  The food is also not too wet, or floating in too much sauce for that matter.

We spent a small fortune here, mostly because we were all ordering specialty mix drinks from the bar at $8.00 a piece.  Most of the drinks come in 18"" glasses- we ordered the Plum Collins (made with plum wine), Mai Thai (rum, vodka, and no grenadine), and the Pear Mojito (sour and strong).  They also gave us free egg rolls that were so disgusting that we could not eat them, they were dripping in grease and came with Thousand Island dressing.  Ugh...but they were free, but I would not recommend paying money for them.  I really liked the Salt & Pepper Calamari on a bed of fried noodles.  These were more like calamari strings, and was not authentic, but the dipping sauce was even good.  If you like squid like me, and have no preconceived notions of what S&P Squid should taste like, then order it.

I love veggies, so I really liked the a la cart portion of the menu, where you could order small sides for $2.95.  We ordered: spinach with garlic (a little bland), cold green tea noodles (needed some sauce or even sesame seeds to make them taste like something), Asparagus (more onion than asparagus), Cucumber Salad (I recommend adding vinegar).  The only other side that I wanted to order, but did not was the Spicy Dry-fried Green Beans.  

The Dan Dan Noodles did not disappoint, however they were not true Dan Dan, of course.  But, the noodles were al dente with a nice spring to them and the sauce was spicy and flavorful.  I would ditch the cucumber and the bean sprouts and mix them in with the cucumber salad on the side.  Warm and wilted veggies do not have their place in Dan Dan unless they are water spinach or snow pea tips.  The Chicken and Eggplant was excellent for a non-Chinese restaurant.  The sauce was thick and sweet, not spicy by any means, and the eggplant was not greasy.  The Stir-Fried Lamb and Tomato was actually very delicious and had a dark, thick oyster based sauce.  The tomatoes did not make it watery at all, and the meat had the perfect rareness versus char on it.

The VIP duck was another story...The duck did not even look like duck, because it was previously frozen and then braised in flavored sauce for hours.  Basically, you could not even taste the duck.  It could have been a thick filet of pork for all we know.  It came with flatbread to hard that you could not fold it over, and scallions, but no hoisen sauce.  Not recommended...

Chang's is all about their new dessert shooters, you know the ones like everyone else has now (ex: Applebees).  But, we were lame and ordered the cheesecake.  My Mom really wanted the cheesecake and liked that it did not have a lemon flavor to it.  However, all I tasted was Crisco and no cheese.  You might want to skip dessert here and go to the new tart yogurt self-serve stall over by Macy's.

To be honest, I don't think that I will ever go back here because Tampa has so much authentic Chinese food to offer at reasonable prices.  But, this was a great place for me to try once, for a special occasion, and have some great drinks.  Now I am moving on.",2009-08-23 13:52:07

Dr. Sopas is a lactation consultant so I thought that would be a great asset to have while I learned to breast feed my newborn.  I called the practice a month prior to my due date and they told me just to call when my son was born and arrange an appointment typically for 3 days post birth.

My son was born on a Wednesday;  I called the office and they told me to come in on Monday.  The pediatrician and nurses at the hospital strongly encouraged me to make a Saturday appointment;  they said it was important to try and document his low weight which would likely be that day.  The office gave me THE HARDEST time about this b/c Saturday is for sick kids / acute care only.  A).  I think having a newborn is an ACUTE issue,  I didn't exactly plan the birthday.  B).  When I called a month prior you told me the ideal time to come in was 3 days later, why should Wednesday babies not get ideal treatment?   

They eventually obliged as I said if they couldn't take me I would go else where.  We went in for the appointment on Saturday.  I was unable to see Dr. Sopas (which was understandable since it was a weekend appointment), and I found the doctor we did see to be rather cold.  In fact she made me cry lecturing me about bringing my newborn in on a Saturday as that is when all the sick kids come in (I guess on Mondays only healthy kids come, right!?).  She was not amazing,  but we kept our original Monday appt to give Dr. Sopas a chance. 

Dr. Sopas was better,  but not worth dealing with the practice.  No one calls you back, the nursing staff is not friendly (even with the babies!) it was all very cold.  Their nurses can't even hold your babies I guess as a liability issue?  They wouldn't even go as far to adjust my baby's position on the scale.  I also found the offices dirty.

Obviously, I switched after two appointments and have been using Chop homecare network.  Everyone in that office has been incredibly friendly,  and even though I was stressed and not sleeping more so than ever before in my life,  no one has managed to make me cry!


****edit 10/1/2014 nearly 15 months after this incident one of the doctors at the practice reached out to me.  He seemed very sincere and listened to my issues and responded promptly.  I am leaving my review because this is what actually happened to me,  but it is worth noting that someone apologized for what happened and listened to my suggestions.  Hopefully this was an isolated incident!",2013-09-14 17:04:24
SlCh1jo9hCT2GhrtohfNQA,wHxDyAegrNiUzqXBKjAbvQ,_C7QiQQc47AOEv4PE3Kong,5.0,8,1,3,"When I told my friend we wanted to go to Commander's Palace, she scoffed and stated that she knew well that these celebrated New Orleans restaurants were nothing more than tourist traps with mediocre food.  Well,  Commander's Palace deserves all the accolades it's been awarded, from the impeccable service to the food. You don't have a meal here. You form memories worthy of quotes from Proust.

We arrived to find the famous blue and white awning of photo fame. Immediately, gracious Southern service was extended as the valet parking attendant took photos of the four of us grinning happily outside. Our reservations were rather last minute, so we got seating in dimly lit intimate room. But that was not the table we wanted so as soon as we asked to be switched, the manager went out of his way to move us to the Garden Room, a huge dining room surrounded by glass and highlighting the live oak trees in the yard. It was sunny, it was airy, it was like getting ready to dine in a gazebo. Our hearts were already floating when the waiter pulled our chairs out to seat us.

We started off with bread, and prepared ourselves for the dreaded NOLA bread that always taste stale. Here the rolls were okay but then, we got served after with our soup a loaf of fresh baked bread that made up for all the bad bread experiences that had marked our trip. As for our starters, the gumbo was thick with mushrooms and chicken and flavorful, while the coconut soup was a complex blend of seasonings with an incredible mouth feel. All the while we ate, the waitstaff would unobtrusively refill glasses and take away cleaned plates, five star service that functioned like a well oiled machine. The seasoned waiters made jokes and allowed their personalities to show through while our main waiter, more formal, we guessed was in training. But everyone who waited on us knew his or her job well.

Then the entrees came. The trout, exquisite. Fresh, perfectly cooked along with the vegetables it came with. The citrus based sauce was light and a perfect accompaniment. Two of us had the fried  oysters on Romaine. NOLA oysters rank among the world's best and these plump, tender delights fried in the lightest batter were the best of the best. Nola is indeed a dangerous place. I could eat these every day and not get tired. The shrimp and grits, another tasty winner though McPhail does his grits fluffy as opposed to heavily creamy. The plating makes you want to eat the food; one taste makes you not stop.

The 25 cent martinis are a hoot and they do not stint on the liquor. Commander's Palace also has other mixed cocktails, the Sunset one evening arriving with a pair of plastic glasses. They make it fun here, they make it memorable.

And the much touted bread pudding souffle? Ah, how it just slid down our throats as if it belonged home. Had we known how special it was, we would have ordered one for each of us instead of sharing. It was too late to order more, as it has to be ordered at the beginning of the meal. The cheesecake, while excellent, paled in comparison.

And my friend's comment at the end of this meal? ""One of the best I've ever had."" Well, thankfully, eating crow did in no way diminish the culinary masterpieces we were served. So believe the hype, and come here when you visit NOLA and ask to be seated in the Garden Room.",2014-08-29 21:10:54

I LOVE GOOD BBQ!
I will try almost any BBQ joint at least once. Today was Smokin' J's BBQ...

This place doesn't look like much. It's a converted house with a tin shed lean-to attached and a rickety looking smoke-shack next to it.
There is no ""inside"" for customers. You order at a window and either stand outside and wait or sit in your car and wait. 
I got the pulled pork and sausage combo sammich with beans, tater salad and a Pepsi (Nope to Woke Coke!).
They were steady busy, but not slammed, and it really took a long time to get my order. I'm sure I waited 20-25 minutes just standing outside in the parking lot. (The reason I didn't sit in my car is because some jackass pulled in really tight next to me and I wouldn't have been able to open my car door to get in!)
As I dreaded the prospect of eating sloppy, messy BBQ in my car I finally noticed a few picnic tables out in front of the building.
 A lady walked out and handed me my food. I didn't get the Pepsi I ordered.
I went back to the window and said something. The guy who took my money had to go find my receipt and check it to see if in fact I had ordered and paid for a soda and then it took another 3-4 minutes before he finally handed it to me.
As my food cools off...

I sat down at one of the picnic tables and immediately became aware of all the road noise, exhaust fumes, and flies I was going to have to suffer while I ate.
The pulled pork was actually pretty good, the sausage was nothing real special and the beans and tater salad were not memorable at all. I did like the BBQ sauce.
After I ate I wanted to wash my hands. Smokin' J's BBQ has no public restroom that I saw, so I found an outside water faucet attached to the house-building and I rinsed my hands the best I could without benefit of soap.

As I have written before in previous reviews, the dinning experience is not just about the food, it's also atmosphere, the attitude or grace of the employees and the general environment of the situation. I think I would have rated Smokin' J's BBQ at least one more star higher if the wait-time and overall environment had been better.",2021-06-13 19:03:42

STAY AWAY from Kane's furniture. They are content to sell broken pieces and take your money while offering no recourse!

We purchased over $2,500.00 worth of furniture and merchandise from the store on Dale Mabry in Tampa and were advised that one piece (of the 8) was on back order and the rest would be delivered that week. 

Our biggest issue other than this the delivery debacle (see below) is that we also purchased a wall mounted clock with mirrors from the floor stock as we loved the piece. 
We asked if there was a non-display piece and was told no.  
We purchased it anyway and got it home. As we were in the process of moving house we were not able to put it up right away and put it in a safe place for 4 weeks. 

When we did put it up this weekend, we discovered that it was broken. When I called Kane's to ask if we could exchange it for another or have it serviced I was told that we had bought it ""as is"" and there was nothing they could do. 
I said that their sales person, Miguel, did not inform us that this product was broken and that we had bought a working clock, as advised by Miguel when we asked him, and they said they were ""sorry but that there was nothing they could do!  We had bought ""as is"".""

It absolutely didn't matter to Kane's that their sales person is as at fault, they were not prepared to take any responsibility for their salesmans poor work and BASIC THIEVERY!! We now have a $200 clock on our wall that ticks but doesn't move!  

Now for the delivery debacle!!  

The first delivery arrived and we were told that only 4 pieces were available of the 7 as the remaining 3 were on back order. We were not told of this when we purchased. 

The follow up delivery a week later never arrived and we had waited all day and we did not receive a phone call. 

The third attempt for delivery after we chased them up was due a week later but they called that morning saying that the furniture was damaged and wouldn't be delivered that day. It was now on back order - again!!

Upon chasing up again we were informed that part of the delivery would take place the following week with the remainder a week after that again. We are still waiting on the full delivery and this has now been going on for 4.5 weeks!!

We will never buy from this company again!!!",2015-02-19 22:20:37

We had friends in town and wanted to try a new place, so after browsing the dinner menu on Yelp (which is not the accurate menu, I might add) we decided on Mack & Kate's. 

To start, our table ordered Oysters, Cauliflower Tots, and several cups of French Onion Soup. I personally ordered the soup since I happen to love a good cup of soup topped with bread and melted cheese. After receiving my soup, I quickly realized there was no cheese in my cup, just soup and a piece of bread. Our table agreed that our server had mentioned cheese when he was describing the soup before we ordered, and that no one had eaten French Onion Soup without the customary cheese on top. When he returned to check on us, we asked about the lack of cheese. He quickly apologized and said that they were very busy and the person who put together the soups must have forgotten the cheese, and that normally the soup would have cheese atop the bread, melted with a small torch. He left the room and came back with a small plate with 4 slices of cheese for us to add to our soup. Wait, what? We were expected to add a slice of cold cheese to our (by this time) lukewarm soup? 
There was still room for improvement with the rest of the meal, so we ate what was left of our disappointing soup and moved on to entrees. 

The highlight of our entrees were the Shrimp and Grits. Two people in our party ordered this dish upon recommendation and were very happy with it. I happen to eat mostly vegetarian, and our server made the recommendation of Shrimp/Chicken Pasta without the Shrimp or Chicken. I rarely have issues eating anywhere, as the chef is generally happy to prepare a dish to accommodate non meat eaters, and I'm usually very pleased with whatever I end up with. The pasta I was served here was another story. It was just plain disappointing. I had a few others try it to be sure I wasn't just being picky, and everyone agreed it simply wasn't good; the consistency and flavor were both off. We reluctantly mentioned this to our server and he apologized there weren't more meatless options on the menu, he was happy to bring me something else. I suggested the Lobster Mac, minus the Lobster, and even though he warned me it would take a bit to prepare, I went with it hoping the dish plus the wait would make up for the disappointing pasta. Everyone else had long finished their meals by the time the Mac arrived (at least we had the expectation it wouldn't arrive quickly), and it wasn't the best I've had, but it was much better than the original pasta dish. Our server let us know several times that he would only charge us half price for the Macaroni, and we were pretty surprised that we were being charged anything for my meal after all that. Several of us previously worked in the service industry, and were disappointed that this restaurant wasn't doing more to ensure an impressive experience. Simply having a manager come out to chat with us would have been a nice touch. 

Suggestions would have been: new soups served with melted cheese, or soups without melted cheese removed from the bill, and no charge for the late dish that replaced my lackluster pasta. 
Maybe the automatic gratuity assigned to our party of 6 made them think they didn't need to take better care of us? We had high hopes for Mack & Kate's before dining here. There are too many other amazing restaurants to impress out of town guests with, and we won't be back. 

The two stars I reluctantly gave here go to the server- at least he was apologetic and polite.",2015-05-17 13:20:14

We were greeted and sat at our table by the friendly host and our server-Mindy-arrived quickly to take our drink order. When Mindy delivered our drinks, we had a few questions about menu items which she answered-I love it when the servers actually knows all about the menu and can offer suggestions. We ordered the BBQ shrimp and crab claws as our appetizers. They quickly arrived at our table and looked very appealing. I have had BBQ Shrimp at most restaurants around town because I love them, but these really were the best I have ever had. They were cooked perfectly-I don't like it when they are over cooked -which happens a lot of the time-and they were perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of spice and not 'just oil' but really juicy goodness to dip the fresh hot bread in. The crabs claws were excellent also, I love the seasoning to dip the bread in-different flavor than the BBQ Shrimp. Glad they don't just put the same stuff on different food. I ordered the 1/2 seafood platter-fried shrimp, soft shell crab,  catfish, crawfish balls but unfortunately they were out of fried oysters..but the made up the missing oysters with shrimp. Fried perfect !! The soft shell crab was so juicy. I ate a couple of everything on the platter and realized I didn't even use the tarter sauce or cocktail sauce to dip the fried seafood in..that's when I realized how good everything tasted-it didn't need to be covered up with dipping sauce. BUT..then I tried both of the sauces-and they were delicious !! The meal just got better with each bite !! The half platter was massive and could have been shared between 4 people easy !! We brought some friends in visiting from West Virginia and they both ordered the crab stuffed shrimp. I tasted one and it was good. Mindy, our server, was very attentive which made our dining experience even better. So happy that our tourist friends got a taste of real New Orleans food that I am sure made their trip memorable. We just moved back to the area so we have not been to Deanie's in years, I can happily report its even better than I remember and can't wait to make many return visits. Looking forward to trying the fried oyster next time !!",2019-10-05 21:40:54

And while there was a few minor kinks that had Square Peg just fall short of 5 stars (I FINALLY have a review where I wish I could give half stars!), it definitely demonstrated why its worthy of several more visits down the line. Especially once their brunch gets a little more seasoned and they kick off the late night happy hour that they have in the works.

I enjoyed Matt Levin's cooking at Adsum, and while I find Tapestry to be significantly better in a lot of ways; I've found myself missing it in a lot of ways. And while I really enjoyed and saw the potential of the spot that it was in, I never really cared for Marathon Grill all that much. So the fact that the space and the chef just happened to come together was a definite plus for me. And overall it adds up to a chill atmosphere that serves diner inspired food with a unique twist, as well as some killer cocktails.

Since Levin is known for things like his Tastykake Sliders (tiny burgers with Kandy Kake ""buns"") you know that he likes to do things a little outside of the box. And while the menu most definitely has its bold innovations that I am salivating for as a result (Mac & Cheese Grilled Cheese, Cheese Steak Pot Pie, Fried Chicken Tacos! Do want! Do Want!), there are a few innovations that just kind of clashed. While Chocolate Habanero Chicken Wings were perfectly cooked and the Maytag blue dip it came with was a simple pleasure. But the sweetness of the chocolate and the spice of the pepper canceled each other out to the point that I didn't get much of either. And as Michelle said General Tso definitely waged war on the Cobb salad. But the breakfast poutine with its sausage gravy and fried egg yolk oozing onto fries and bacon is a SERIOUS contender for my last meal on earth. And since breakfast is available any time of day at Square Peg you don't need to wait for the brunching hour to indulge upon it! And save room for dessert if you can (I hit a delicious wall during it but still managed too), because things like the chocolate pudding pie with pretzel crust and burnt bananas in a mason jar, and the carrot cake sundae (you read that right!) are most certainly worth it.

Square Peg also offers up a versatile cocktail menu that had plenty of interesting blends, and even had a spiked milk shake list that could contend with the one at PYT. The Brunch menu yielded specialty cocktails like the Fine + Dandy (a little too fruity for my tastes but appreciated the blackberry, blueberry, and limoncello combo) and a BACON Mary (which I would have so gotten if it was done with vodka instead of scotch) and a specialty line of juleps which all sounded and looked amazing. Since it cost $9 and was one of the least daring that I've had in Philly, the basic Bloody Mary could use a bit of work. Since I've been known to abide (http://forums.klipsch.com/forums/storage/4/1707753/the-dude.jpg) I just had to get the Little Lebowski milkshake, and I am happy to report that it was quite the urban achiever! While the base was definitely similar to The Dude shake at PYT, the Prairie Organic Vodka and addition of Stumptown coffee did give it an upgrade.

It was the first time Square Peg ever had a brunch, so as expected a number of things did run out due to the demand. And while I did like that the brunch menu had the addition of some delicious starters and specialty cocktails, I didn't like that the main dishes were the exact same as the everyday breakfast menu, and wouldn't mind seeing at least a couple specials added on down the road. But I was very impressed overall, especially by our extremely attentive and highly professional server (who I also wish I could remember the name of!). And it was cool that the managers were cool and friendly enough to check in on us too. So when it comes down to it I think I have reason to like this Square Peg more than the old school 80's show (http://youtu.be/yujw1Shc-KI)!",2012-04-23 06:56:21

I thought I had found ""my place"" in the city. 

Today I went in and got yet another amazing pedicure... ahhh I was feeling good. Then I was handed over to the manicurist, Heather. As I was getting started, a woman who knew Heather came in and started getting a pedicure and then was supposed to get a manicure with her. Let me tell you that I have had dozens of gel manicures, this was the fastest one I have ever had.. she was rushing so much (I assume so that the other chick didn't have to wait) that she kept making mistakes up to and including cutting my cuticle until it bled. I have NEVER had someone cut me and make it bleed during a manicure. Heather told me that ""your skin is too close to the cuticles so it got cut, sorry"" Uh... isn't everyone's skin right next to the cuticle? And wouldn't this have come up during the hundreds of manicures I have had in the past 15 years?

Heather then poured some miscellaneous blue stuff on there, popped the cutters in a jar next to her, and proceeded to rush through AKA finish the shittiest manicure I have ever had in my life. When the woman sat down next to me and stared at us, Heather assured her she was almost done.. one little squirt of lotion and some, um, neosporin globed on my nail and she was like THANKS BYE! 

I looked at my nails and not only was there gel polish ""outside the lines"" and on my hand, my other cuticles were awful looking! I don't even think she looked at my nails when she was ""finished"".

Under any other circumstances, I would have complained and asked for someone to fix what will now be called ""the shittiest manicure I've ever had."" However, when I saw Heather just pop those cuticle cutters back in the magical jar of blue stuff to use on the next customer (you know, the ones covered in my blood).. I said no way was I letting anyone else or any thing touch me. 

This will be the manicure that sets the bar for all other shitty manicures, as in ""OH hey, that manicure you got at the airport sure looks shitty, but remember the time I got my nails done at Genesis?? Now THAT was a shitty manicure.""

Sadly, even the best pedicure I have ever had can't make me forget that this place is not sanitary.",2013-08-03 21:25:45

Shortly after we decided to have our first baby at IU North we signed up for the Birth Options class (free). We thought it would be a great way to see the hospital, get a feel for their philosophy, and get a sneak peek at where we'll be spending what will likely be the most exciting and terrifying experience of our lives. We were right! It was incredibly helpful. On the particular date of our Birth Options class we were the only ones to show up, so we got to spend 2 hours with the Childbirth Education Coordinator (Dianna) and got some very helpful information. We left knowing we'd made the right decision!

We registered my mom for the Grandparenting class (free) and she had a great experience! She left having learned all of the things Dianna had told us she would! The class is designed to give grandparents a heads up about all of the things that may have changed since they were parents many moons ago...and also to encourage grandparents-to-be to take their cues from the parents-to-be in order to be as helpful as possible.

We ended up registering for the 7-week Lamaze class, which includes a class on breastfeeding and newborn care. This class cost $250 - but after the Birth Options Class Dianna threw in a Dad's class (normally $25) for FREE for my husband.

My husband took the Dad's Class last weekend and had nothing but great things to say. He left feeling informed and at ease. The guy who taught the class is a social worker and a dad of 3. He had some great insight for the dads, and apparently created a really safe atmosphere for them to ask questions and feel very comfortable.

Each time I've registered for a class (grandparents, dad's class, lamaze class) I've received a personal email back from Dianna. She remembers me each time and adds a little personal note to see how I'm doing or to ask about something we'd talked about previously. How sweet, right?! :)

My only beef with the Childbirth Education offerings is that its tricky to find them on the IU health website. You have to visit the ""Expressions Store for Women"" to register for the classes.",2013-09-20 03:42:34

Sacred Pepper is in a large shopping plaza next to Cigar City Brew Pub, O'Brien's Irish Pub & Grill, Sushi Alive, Edward's Cigar Lounge, Oak Emporium Furniture, Anytime Fitness, and Keiser Career College.  There is a private parking lot on site with plenty of parking available. Upon entering the main foyer, you are instantly impressed by chic blue led lighting, modern drop down crystal pendant lights, crystal balls separating the entryway foyer from the bar, and a very open modern bar.  The bar area was set against a chic wall of moving blue bubbles, a chihuly chandelier, a large wrap around bar, and textured wood floors. We had reservations and were greeted and seated in under 5 minutes in a comfy circular high back leather plush booth.  Our food came out quickly in under 10 minutes. 

For the appetizer, we ordered the Sacred Pepper House Salad which consisted of mixed greens, hearts of palm, Candy's pecans, and coconut white balsamic dressing. (4/5)

For our entree, we ordered the Short Rib Cavatelli which consisted of handmade cavatelli, braised short rib ragu, and a side of  with mashed potatoes. The sauce was a bit too smoky flavored for my liking. (4/5) 

We also got the Baked Lobster & Crab Rotolo which consisted of delicate pasta stuffed with Maine lobster, ricotta, cream sauce, Parmesan with a side of Brussel sprouts. The Crab rotolo pasta was a wee bit too thick, bland, and not as cheesy or saucy as the Crab Rotolo that I had at 717. I'd have to recommend 717's entree over this one.  The Lobster was just on top and should've been inside the rotolo. (4/5) 

We also got the Oak Grilled Norwegian Salmon which included heirloom tomato salad, white wine butter sauce, and quinoa was probably the healthiest of the dishes and came off as very light but filling. (4/5)

For dessert we got the chocolate lava cake served with the vanilla ice cream it did not disappoint! (5/5) 

The hallway to the restrooms was curved and painted in a very space-style groovy pattern unlike anything I've ever seen before. It was almost like we were entering a worm-hole to get to the bathrooms. Very cool!  

Our server, brought out entrees while people were still working on their appetizers. After explaining to the server that we did not want rushed service and it is not customary to bring out a course until everyone finishes their current course, our server once again brought out dessert menu's while people were still eating their entrees. I really don't see how a server can make the same mistake twice especially after we explained that it is not customary. For such an upscale chic restaurant, I really was disappointed by such rushed service.  We still managed to have a good time despite a couple of hiccups.",2017-09-04 21:44:29

Because the weather was exceptionally pleasant, we asked to sit on the small patio deck. Several other small parties were already seated there, and I saw a few different servers among those tables. So I'm not sure where the communication breakdown was, but after 20 minutes, we still had not been greeted by any server. The hostess noticed, however, and sent a friendly waitress to our table. She was very cute & tried to be helpful, but I was not surprised later when she mentioned she had not been waitressing long. I'm not sure if she meant at Ballyhoo specifically, but my guess is occupationally.... I had to ask twice for our beers, and then wave her over to get tools for my crab legs. And hubs had to wait quite a while to get her attention for something he needed, as well. But, she was so friendly & apologetic that we weren't terribly irritated. Our food was very good, and of course I ordered way more than I could eat.

I started with a cup of She Crab Ballyhoo, a New England snow crab bisque, for $3.99, and it was outstanding. Then, I couldn't decide if I wanted to try the Bimini Stuffed Grouper (stuffed with crab, shrimp, & scallops) for $23.99, or the Seafood Cobb Salad with cocktail shrimp, scallops, lobster, & bacon, for $14.99... so I ordered the Snow Crab & Shrimp with black beans & yellow rice and sauteed spinach for $17.99. The  crab tasted very buttery straight from the shell, and I loved it! I was also pleased with the quantity of two decent size clusters. My four large fried shrimp were also delicious, with a light breading that didn't overpower the shrimp. The spinach tasted a bit fishy, but I didn't notice that flavor when I warmed it up at work a couple of days later (my tastebuds may have been in blissful seafood overload). I also enjoyed the black beans & yellow rice much more as left-overs... the couple of bites I had initially were fairly bland. But once I stirred & warmed them up at work days later, I really enjoyed their solid tropical flavor.

Ballyhoo offers all you can eat snow crab on Tuesdays, for around $25, but the meal I ordered for $17.99 with snow crab & shrimp was too much for *me* to eat in one sitting. Hubs wants to give AYCE a go, however. Regardless, we thoroughly enjoyed our first meal here and definitely look forward to returning to try many of their other menu items.",2017-05-10 02:03:50

Just kidding, although I did feel the love when I was brought to Amis to celebrate Valentine's Day.  The boo planned way in advance and got our reservation a couple of months prior.  Since there are already hundreds of reviews telling you how wonderful Amis is, I'll simply tell you what I ordered and how I felt about it.

First off - house red.  So deliciously palatable from somebody who primarily drinks white wine.  I had the waiter write it down for me.

Starters:  Swordfish Meatballs, Baked Pecorino, and Sweet Breads.  On a hot tip from my coworker I ordered the sweetbreads, the remainder was from yelp reviews.  The meatballs didn't really taste like swordfish per say, but they were tasty.  The sweet breads on the other hand, were exotic, tender, and a bit citrusy.  Granted, I did not ask what ""breads"" of the body these were before I ate them, and I felt a little guilty afterwards when I found out it was from baby cow (veal) since I'm not a veal eater.  Still, it was a good decision.  They weren't organy...and not what I expected, which was pulsating food with veins throughout.  It was as tender as slow roasted pork, and accompanied by a marmalade that added a sweetness to the savory.  Baked Pecorino was good, but it didn't stand out as much as the sweet breads in terms of memorability.

Pasta:  Chestnut Fettucine with Duck Ragu...again ordered on the hot tip, and well worth it.  The portion size is just right to ensure you're not taking it home, but you're full enough.  Little flakes and some chunks of duck meat hid in the fettucine hollows.  It's not served with a red sauce, it's a sauce from the duck...so a little brown in color but hearty in taste.

Main:  Lamb Shank.  I know it's hypocritical to say I'm not a veal eater and then I go to town on a lamb.  But I'm a hypocrite.  The lamb was so so good.  We had gawkers from both sides of the table ooohing over it.  You receive a pretty sizable shank, which looks like a big drumstick.  It's tender, falls off the bone, and has a flavor I can only describe as ""homey"".  Again, it's served in a brown-ish sauce, which typically I despise - it's my one hate, ghoulashy things - but the meat was so good I got over the sauce.

We didn't get dessert since we were a little drunk and a lot full.  But they highly recommended the waffle to us.  I'll miss you Amis - til next time!",2013-02-21 15:22:44

well, ive been this restaurant about 30 times. im also going to do a review on my youtube page which currently gets about 1600 veiws a week. michelle was our waitress. besides being gorgeous she was a professional waitress who made our party feel special and we wanted for nothing. when i told her that i review restaurants she only said that that would be great and thAT SHE WOULD LOOK FOR IT AND Thanked me. It must be nice when you know you are good and can always be proud of the place where you work. when she asked what my favorite restaurant was i did mention one other but i said that at any time someone could suggest hop angel and i would want to go because there is not another restaurant that i like better period. the selection of beers and unusual ones is outstanding and drink and shot prices are not high. i recall seeing ""the b man"" marky b a blues harmonosist there once upon a time.  it is even a venue for music sometimes. 
just commenting on what i had this time which was a magners hard apple cider in the bottle. which is just the way i like it and a ginger alcoholic beverage that ive not seen anywhere else. i will go back and have another. 
for my appetiser i ordered the crab mac and cheese. the secret is order that as a meal, share it or take half home. it is a hardy meal by its self. they use a light curly noodle, a mxiture of cheeses and bread crumbs on top. it is so good that i could take the lords name in vain describing it. especially after a couple of those ginger drinks. i really enjoy having nontraditional drinks like hard ciders, i love the fruit and the ginger drink of course. but if im in the mood for beer i will go to the beer garden at the hop angel. i am frothing just thinking about it. 
for my entree i ordered te sirloin steak, medium rare with mashed potatoes and green beans michelle brought me asparagus. i could go on to talk about the layers of flavor in the delicious brown gravy that is a reduction prepared to perfection drizzled on one edge of the meat so that at my choice and convenience i can taste the tender, thich, perfectly cooked to order steak or dip. and i like to dip. a bus man came to the table within minutes to take extra plates. we were schmearing the signature hop angel mustard on the delicious bread and eating it and watching our faces turn red from the fresh horseradish. i dont eat steak often any more so when i do i want it to be ay least as good as i would make as i come from a family of cookers. i could not stop eating it. i love the hop angel. 6 stars out of 5. there is not a restaurant i like better. from cleanliness aand i have worked in restaurants and kitchens myself, to prompt courteous service im telling you i take my mother to this restaurant and she is one tough cookie and she comes back. 
i will end this with there is a difference between a cook and a chef. the hop angel has a chef who puts his own flair in the dishes he creates and changes the menu.
its about to change and i cant wait. ill miss whats gone but im so excited to try the new addition that it becomes one oif the positive points about visiting the hop angel. always a positive experience. thanx for the pendulous abdomen    again    oh it hurts but it was so damn good. blessings.",2015-03-04 02:16:53
xE2uYUfhWd2zEcxc50j2yg,kxj7TPtJY2zbEjGV0PYfAA,rz5nKwN7Ul5B4x8vBH2XmA,4.0,3,2,2,"Hey, everyone: this hotel isn't that bad.  Ramada has been renovating this space like CRAZY so everything seems a lot nicer than it was when other people were writing reviews.  

And when I say renovating: our room literally smelled like fresh paint because they had clearly just gone through and deep-cleaned, installed new carpet, and painted all of the walls/ceilings.  I definitely LOVE walking into a newly renovated hotel, especially one that just smells like paint and new carpet and not dingy old cigarette smoke.

Yes, the lobby is small but they've installed a new ""Mart"" for all of your snacking/food needs.  They sell pop, chips, candy, cookies, etc. plus frozen meals in case you need some real food.  The desk staff were nice enough (though busy since alone) so be prepared to wait a minute while they field a bunch of things that were happening before you walked in.  I definitely don't begrudge them this since they can't help that they're alone working at a desk while people are calling and multiple people are checking in and asking questions, so just exercise some patience.  Newly renovated, nicely decorated, there's some space to sit down, watch TV if you're so inclined.

Rooms were nicely renovated with completely new carpet and furniture, plus new beds and comfortable bedding.  Mattresses were a bit hard for my taste, but they weren't ""un-sleepable"" so that's fine.  There were three pillows per bed and you can call the front desk for more if necessary.  We needed an extra cot for one person and they brought it promptly to our room AT NO CHARGE, which was excellent.  I definitely hate hotels that upcharge for extra people and cot needs since hotels are already expensive enough.  Room bathroom is kind of small, in that the vanity and sink are outside the room with the toilet and the shower.  That's fine, but it can get kind of loud if you're sharing a room with people and they're all using that sink area while you're laying in bed.  Shower was clean, toilet was clean, the entire space was generally clean and I didn't feel disgusting.  

Double queen room was large, had two seats for lounging and fit five people and all of our crap so that was nice.  Every room has a microwave and mini-fridge which helped with our beer drinking.  FREE WIFI which is always a great selling point for me.  

The pool area was clean, there were a LOT of towels, plenty of seating (including tables) and the water was SUPER WARM.  The pool area is essentially a gigantic green house so it is really hot in there in the summer, so be prepared.  I could definitely see being unhappier with my stay if we had a door that opened directly into that crazy greenhouse room that was hot and pool-smelly, but we didn't so that's fine.  The pool was big, deep and great for swimming or just sitting around and lounging.  

All in all, a good hotel.  It's on the east side of the river across from the Titans stadium, which I imagine is DISGUSTING during sporting and/or concert events (especially gross, hick CMA crap).  Since nothing was going on over there, we weren't bothered by anyone.  I can't attest to anyone being disgusting in the hotel because of those events, but since this was a quiet weekend we had fun.

Let's be real here: it's not ever the hotel's fault that its guests are gross country music fans who trash bathrooms because they're trashy - it's the guests' fault.  During concert or football season, maybe find somewhere else to stay, but this was a good enough deal.

Side note: What is with Nashville hotels being SO expensive?  This town is small and it's not that great, so why are some hotels like $200+ night?  Even with tax this hotel was like $175 per night, which was too much but fine split between five people over two nights.  But, seriously - what is the deal?",2015-06-29 02:19:46

The restaurant reviews were originally posted on the Modern Hotel Yelp page but in June 2019 looks like owners set up a separate Yelp page for the Modern Bar and Restaurant.  Among my hubby's and my top 3 favorites of all eateries in Boise and after umpteen visits over the last 6 years we easily opine 5 stars for it - see review posted at that Yelp page - https://www.yelp.com/biz/modern-bar-and-restaurant-boise-3.

But we stay-cationed at the Modern Hotel with a 'one time is enough' experience.  I imagine that had as much to do with our demographic as with the hotel because the Modern Hotel consistently wins ""Best of Boise"" ratings from a local alternative newspaper in a yearly contest and gets high mention in travel publications.  So this is likely one of those issues where ""it's not you, it's me"" for relationship fit.  We are in the ""Boomer"" demographic - but clearly adventurous enough to appreciate the Modern Bar and Restaurant as regular diners and imbibers there, - and the hotel may better suit a younger age group.

In fact, when we shared with neighbors of about our age who are more hip and well traveled than we that we were planning 'staycation' at the Modern they urged us to reconsider based on their disappointing experience. ""We shoulda listened to you!"", I messaged her early on the evening of our stay.

So I share here for setting expectations.  Different strokes for different folks.  There is much to commend the Modern Hotel but also things that might not work so well.  An out of state traveler-guest who struck up a conversation with me in the parking lot and who was about my age said he and his wife were surprised to find this hotel that was highly touted by a college age relative to be so not a fit for them.  But, he said, ""It's a hell of a good restaurant here - what a find!""  Yes, indeed.  

LOCATION:  The Linen District is far enough from downtown to be out of the chaos but close enough to provide easy access to everything.   Fun Basque wine bar and eatery Txikiteo, same owners as this, is just a couple of blocks walk away.  But there is a goodly amount of noise in the rooms, either from the nighttime 'hot-rod cruising' or from the revelers on the bar patio in the courtyard some of the rooms face.  For some that is no worries.  For others, now you know.  The hotel provides ear plugs on request.

PROPERTY:  Two stores, no elevator.  Some first floor rooms can be accessed from hall and from outside door.  Many rooms accessed only via outside door.  Nice exterior patio with tables for hotel and restaurant guests.  There is a small parking lot in front which is a good thing.  

ROOMS:  Comfy beds but the low slung chair in the room is not the easiest to get in and out of for guests of a certain age.  If you're planning on staying more than overnight the closet space is uber-limited - a 'hang 'em horizantal' cabinet for clothes.  Large desk-top with TV above it.  Wi-fi was not working for sign in and we had to go to the front desk for a work around. (See Service)  Walls are thin, as the saying goes, and your neighbors can be heard. 

BATHS: Spacious step-in doorless shower with two heads and a small window thru which one can gaze into the room or vice versa.  I imagine all that is much fun for some but our issues with the bathroom were practical functional ones:  the tiny pedestal sink lacked any counter space, the door into the bathroom from the bedroom was only about 23"" clear width (I'm size 2, my hubby is 32 waist - not big people but this 'skinny door' felt just odd) and had obscure glass through which one could see with the light on in the loo and the commode was placed directly along the inside of wall that paralleled the bed so...  We've been married nearly 40 years but for a couple newer in acquaintance this might not be such a 'romantic' set up.  

EXTRAS:  Free continental breakfast Mon - Fri for hotel guests.  Not on Sat & Sun given brunch is served 8 - 2.  (Highly recommend the unique brunch!)  We didn't know free breakfast wasn't served on Saturday until after check in on Friday night when a server in the restaurant at dinner told us.  Now you know too.

SERVICE:  The young woman who helped us book our staycation night was so helpful.  In the dozens of times we've been through the hotel lobby on our way to or from the restaurant, always friendly folks.   Alas, on the night of our visit when we couldn't connect to wi-fi and had to go the lobby where the guy on duty had to use an employee password on our phones to make wi-fi work, he was in constipated service mode showing his frustration on that issue and answering a question we asked about the hotel.  Everyone can have a bad day.

ACCESSIBILITY:  ADA parking in lot.  Level in at lobby.  Didn't check for ADA rooms.",2019-08-04 15:37:00
QVOQwgionTzECZeWwGs5lg,2xNYCJxZOrhVsrVMz8mlDQ,da7OrS3jV_VgrlIbjUyQbA,5.0,1,0,0,"It's worth prefacing my review with this statement: I am obsessed with my dog. Really obsessed. 

A few months ago, had to go away for work for five days and needed to board my pitbull. Despite my planning ahead, the facility where I usually leave my dog was all booked, so I needed to find another option with about a week's notice. Please note, it took me forever to find a place that I was comfortable leaving Brew the first time, so trying to decide on another kennel was kind of panic-inducing. After doing some research, I gave Philly Pet Hotels and Villas a call and had a lovely chat with an employee who answered all of my questions and didn't make me feel the least bit crazy about clearly being a helicopter mom. 

PPH&V requires that all dogs come in for a free ""evaluation"" session before officially being allowed to stay overnight and play with the other dogs, which I think is great. I was able to get Brew in quickly and got a call in the middle of the day to let me know that he was doing fine and had passed his test. The woman I spoke to had clearly actually paid attention to Brew while he was playing and I really got the sense that she cared about Brew's, the other dogs' and my happiness. 

Needless to say, since then I have used Philly Pet Hotel & Villas a bajillion times. Now that I'm a regular customer, I can book online, which I love - but no matter what form of communication you use, they always respond in a super-timely and professional manner. They always greet Brew by name, they know his routine, they wash and fold his blanket (what?! I don't even do that for my dog at home!), and for some reason, he always smells really good when I pick him up after a stay - no complaints from me about that, trust.

I will say, this place is a little pricey. Although the base price for an overnight stay is quite reasonable, the ""add-ons"" definitely add up, especially if you're going away for more than a weekend. I'm not talking about doggy massages here - just an hour of play time or an extra walk will cost you an extra charge. But that being said, you absolutely get what you pay for, and working with a fabulous staff and  picking up a happy and healthy dog after a vacation is worth every penny!",2013-08-06 17:20:13
-tZ5YTXS7NFjKs3rdRMR3w,wwrlJT3JLb-A_0NrlGAzOg,SDUHdtyCg-1jI5MZiC5mzw,4.0,3,2,2,"I've been coming to this place for years. 
Since I lived in Reno back in 2000, and I could walk across the street from my casa to get lovely food and great beer.

I always drag my cousins out here when I come back into Reno, and since they opened a temporary little Burning Man-type shop right about where I used to live, I was able to walk over and satiate my needs during my shopping breaks when I came back into town from the desert this year. 

The food has been the same for years, but they've now made some changes. Some good. Some bad. I really only order off the bar menu anyway. Always have. It's just so comforting! Unfortunately, they've taken off some favorites. The Lamb Burger was soooooo good, and now it's soooo gone. The pizzas are all changed now, and that's disappointing. They used to be really great flavor combinations. I'm not a fan of their new ones, and there's little choice for a pescatarian like myself, even if I bump my meat eating habits up to the realm of poultry. The crust is still tasty, having used the grains from their brewing.

I had a couple of great salads though. Their Cobb Salad is nicely chopped and full of goodies. The Cesar was as tasty as I remember as well. 

The beer is really shining through to me. Maybe it's the added stress of having to brew for competitions as well as their second location that's really making them step things up from where I remember them. I had a great conversation with the brewmeister who talked with me about their belgian ale that he and 5-6 other brewers are making different versions of to take to competition. He even bought me a pint! Yea! 

Speaking of great service, Jaime Ficco is a great man and a wonderful manager. And a heck of an actor, but that's beside the point. We came in one day to pick up a keg we'd ordered for our pig roast and...it wasn't there. The perils of having 2 places to brew for and working your brewery at 90% capacity, I guess. Jaime had them fill us a fresh keg from the vats and paid for our beer while we waited. Score!

I'll be back, but not for awhile, as the commute from Austin (tx, not nv) is a bit much for a pint of Wee Heavy.",2009-09-17 15:15:08
W591aLCGvplknmY4dncc-Q,NOvbwDPu0FaS1SpkXvHdAQ,D-b7yTVZC1SCuKbJgNdIdg,5.0,8,6,7,"So I've read ALL of the past reviews of this festival and I have something to say (kick rocks, peeps, if you don't have the patience to read)...but I'm going to give it 5 stars and here is why:

1.) the town/location is perfect.  CARP is a SMALL town with the event located right near the beach.  Because it's a SMALL beach town instead of a LARGE beach town, there aren't so many rules when it comes to parking.  You can almost park anywhere and walk.  If you have to park a bit further and walk, no worries...you won't be walking too far.  I LOVE IT.  You can pay for parking, but why?  

2.) I felt safe because of the heavy presence of security...and security who was spread out and watchful, but at the same time, super friendly.  I was a bit apprehensive after the tragedy earlier this year with another festival, but nope.  Thank you to the City of Carp for doing this.  

3.) You don't have to go far for live music!  They had several stages with back to back acts each and they were ALL GOOD!  ALL WERE JAMMIN'!  From the main stage to the smaller ones, let's go!

4.). Someone must have read old reviews that there wasn't enough avocado in the past years...and I personally feel that they've kicked up the avocado love for this one.  I saw several vendors selling everything from avocado trinkets, to whole avocados, to all types of avocado food.  The lines may have been long, but you can't complain about lack of avocado this year cause it's there.

5.) Even outside of the festival, the local breweries and restaurants lined up along the sides of the event are ready and prepared for you!  So inviting.  Some even planned their own things for the festival, so YOU ALL HAVE OPTIONS, NINJAS.

6.) And when you want a break from it all, walk up the street to the beach and take a stroll.  I'm always here.  I love this beach.  So having both the festival and the beach was amazing.

Island Brewing Co had a wonderful Reggae band playing in their courtyard and they were badass and incredible.

This event is well planned/well thought out.  Logistic-wise, it is one of the best festivals I've been to considering all of the factors that it takes to make a good festival.  They score high on music and parking.  I love it and hopefully in the years to come, you will, too.",2019-10-07 18:02:37
c509NFGezbeUkjtlbNH7_w,QWIjEOkUoPK-1uklPKL0Iw,2le7R7NHupc5GeBvkniMzQ,1.0,2,0,0,"I guess beauty is a subjective thing because while most of the reviews of this place are positive, I was considerably UNDERWHELMED by this place. 

We stayed in the Opal Two Room suite which wound up being one nice room with a semi decent kitchen, living room, and master bedroom and one standard room with two queen size beds. They were separated by a small 4x4 vestibule, so they were technically connected, but still separated by two doors. Lame. If you wanted to access the kitchen or living area from the smaller standard room, you had to knock the door to be let into or keep the nice room open all the time. I guess the standard room is what is the real disappointment of it all. 

Aside from this, much of the furniture and carpeting has seen better days. Curtains torn on the bottom, carpeting that sheds and has stains on it, and dated and cheap looking decorations to name a few. The pool is just OK. It's worse in person than in pictures and full of nobodies who think they're somebody's. The hot tub downstairs looks old and in need of maintenance. Your room does come with a good sized balcony, but only in the main Opal suite. The other room has a crappy small balcony that everyone else gets. This could be remedied in the future by removing the partition wall and connecting the two balconies into one larger one (pay attention management). There is a private jacuzzi on the balcony, but I was rudely interrupted on my trip by a maintenance person who came to check it, told me it wasn't heating up, and told me I would get a call from management later to fix it. I never got a call nor did I want someone in my room on my vacation. I came here to relax, not look at staff and for the price I paid, this place should have been on top of things BEFORE my arrival. 

Much of the furniture outside has questionable stains on it and the ""garden"" is nothing but overgrown weeds and old Sego palms. There is fruit, water, and sometimes cookies and ice available in a small pantry in the hallway (you're paying for it so have at it, it's just ok, nothing to brag about). The real kicker is the valet. While they do a great job, they expect tips, so hit the bank beforehand and it's $25 a night. They say in and out is ok, but I'll be sure to check my card statement.

The only thing this place has going for itself is its proximity to the beach, no crossing the street for you. The outdoor blue cabanas at the beach are run by a private company who is shady in their fees and practices and won't tell you right from the start what you'll pay for them. Employees at the pool will look you up and down and ask you if you're staying on the property if you aren't white. That was the final straw with this place. I'm staying at this so called resort, you're an employee. Know where you stand and if you don't want to be courteous to ALL guests regardless of race, then go work somewhere else.

Save your money and go to a really nice place. If you're not used to the finer things in life, you'll feel like you're in a palace. Those in the know of a good life, this place isn't all that and certainly not worth the cost. Four stars? More like 1.5. You've been warned.",2019-08-22 14:11:47

Went back to the store and was told by the cashier who serviced me that I must have dropped the card and some one picked it up. Not so because I put everything I received from her back into my wallet before leaving counter and waited in the restaurant, with nothing on the floor as I looked from the floor to the counter in attempts not to stare at anyone. I was really upset so I returned the morning and requested the camera's be reviewed to see what happened to my card and after asking for my contact information I was told by another worker the manager Dave would take a look and get back to me within the next day or 2. I told the worker I would follow up with Dave later in the day. I went back around 9 pm when it's a bit slower and explained the situation and the workers looked at me as if I was nuts. I asked to speak with Dave they tell me there isn't anyone there with that name. So, I asked to speak with a manager, explained the situation again and asked that the camera be reviewed since I keep getting the run around. He takes my information again and says he will review camera's and get back to me within 1-2 days. I asked can this be done in 1 day since I've been given the run around and miss-information. I asked who the worker was I spoke with earlier in the morning and was told they don't give out workers name. I asked will the worker be reprimanded for poor customer service only to be told that was probably the owner. Wow full circle run around as I am now fully convinced this cashier stole my card and this establishment is doing nothing about it. At 1st I entertained the idea that she may have given my card to someone else by mistake but at this point there is clearly some weird cover up. I will continue to pursue the recovery of my card or the monies on it even if I do have to take legal actions as suggested by the State Police. I do not like business establishments that take their customer's security for granted. What if this was my Debit or Credit Card would they have stolen that information as well. I highly suggest not patronizing such a place but if you must please ONLY USE CASH to avoid your personal information or monies being stolen!!!

We wanted Cajun, but not on Bourbon Street, and The Original Pierre Maspero's was highly recommended.  Looking on Yelp it sounded great, so off we went. 
First the good - great location, easy to find, off Bourbon Street (so it wasn't too loud or too filled with drunken partiers -- I mean, there's definitely a place for drunkennes and it's NOLA, but it's also nice to be able to eat without worrying about the crazy.). This place is in a great old building from the 1700s, and had plenty of space.  There was no wait, and they were very quick to seat us in a perfect seat overlooking the sidewalk so we could people watch as we ate.  The waitress was very friendly, and we felt at home as soon as we sat down.  We ordered the Fried gator appetizer, then my dinner partner had the French Onion Soup and I went for the Blackened Chicken Jambalaya. 
The gator was great -- mostly fresh and nice sized bites.  The creole mustard sauce was spicy and delicious.  At one point we discussed eating it straight...at another point we might HAVE.  There was one piece of gator that was straight gristle (as in completely inedible spit it out kind of gristle), but hey -- that's just one bad bite and all the pictures and descriptions of the food sounded great.  The French Onion soup was gooey and drippy and delicious.  My dinner partner rated it 75/10 stars and raved over it.  

Then there's the reason this gets 3 stars despite the nice waitress and great atmosphere and delicious french onion soup.  When you're in NOLA you want good Cajun food, right? I mean of all the things, the ones they should be able to hit out of the park are the Cajun ones.  I knew something was up when our food hit the table literally 30 seconds after the waitress cleared the gator plates.  I thought ""Wow...how did they cook them that fast?"" Well, the answer is - they didn't.  The Jambalaya had clearly been sitting in the kitchen for awhile...the rice was greasy and dry, and the sausage in it was WAAaaay overdone -  crunchy, black (not ""blackened"" just dried up), and blah.  The chicken pieces were OK, but fairly bland, and nowhere near the beautiful presentation pictured on the website.  This is where the creole mustard comes back in. I ended up dumping it into the rice to add a little bit of flavor so that it wasn't SO BLAND.  Maybe they were trying to be ""gentle"" on my out of town tastebuds? Maybe they were tired? Maybe it's a Wednesday so they are just using up leftovers? Whatever the case, it was NOT GOOD.  Definitely not worth the price.  I ordered a Bloody Mary while we waited, and was disappointed there too. It LOOKED good, but was super sweet while lacking the depth of flavor that makes a good Bloody Mary. 

So bottom line? They did great at the things you would expect to be good anywhere -- ambiance, service, French Onion Soup.  But New Orleans is the city of 1000 restaurants, and if I'm going to waste one of my meals on you, I expect you to be able to do the NEW ORLEANS things like Jambalaya and Drinks.  I wish I could get my meal back...I wouldn't choose to spend it here.",2021-03-11 01:45:03

We've all been there--after spending 10 years listening to her complain about her love life, she suddenly meets the man of her dreams, falls in love, and selfishly expects you to find someone else to listen to a dissertation about the reasonably priced bed-sets available at IKEA. After weeks of empathizing with Owen Wilson's character in Wedding Crashers, I received a phone call from my best friend (and her engagement ring) informing me that she had chosen the Philadelphia Racquet Club to host her reception. I braced myself, ready for her to spew a laundry list of Maid of Honor Duties in my direction; I was quite shocked when her annoyingly chipper voice informed me that her wedding planner, Marc, would be handling all of her arrangements. She explained that Marc had years of experience working with Jeffrey Miller Catering at the Philadelphia Racquet Club, and because she was so confident in his abilities, my only MOH Duty was to ""find a suitable date to bring to the most important day of her life"". #missionaccomplished #wasn'tmydad

On the day of her wedding, my incredibly suitable date and I arrived to the Philadelphia Racquet Club.  My first time to the venue, I was absolutely astounded; I walked in to the immaculately polished, architecturally awe-inspiring ballroom and felt like I was walking into a scene in the Great Gatsby. Transported, I took a moment to soak in my regal surroundings; I was overcome by the crisp, fresh, glam atmosphere. Standing in front of the grand staircase, I felt like a princess. Hey Disney, if you're reading this, you should contact the RC to inquire about a new permanent residence for Belle.

As I flitted around, wonderstruck, I realized I was starting to feel hungry (typical). As if on cue, an attractive server appeared, politely offering me a salmon cone. I graciously accepted, and immediately gobbled the delicacy. The cone, much like a savory ice-cream treat, was filled with salmon, avocado, fresh cilantro, and squeezed lime. The quality of each ingredient practically moved me to tears. The salmon was tender and melted in my mouth. The avocado was smooth and rich. The cone crunched, juxtaposing the soft textures of it's filling artistically. Additional logical comments include #mindblown #unreal #hashtagjimmyfallonjustintimberlake.  Seriously, it was that good, and so were all of the hors d'oeuvres I tasted.  

Shortly after we were seated, it was time for dinner. The salmon I ordered was placed in front of me quickly and seamlessly, enhancing the utopian dream in which I was convinced I was entranced.  I looked down at my date's entrée, and saw a beautifully carved piece of medium-rare beef decorating his plate.  My date and I looked at each other and immediately started to eat (see what I mean about suitable?!) The salmon was rich, flaky, and moist, served with vegetables that reflected the season's bounty. I came up for air and attempted to ask my date about his beef, but quickly realized from the Cheshire grin adoring his face that he was enjoying his meal as much as I. Much to the (feigned) delight of our tablemates, I couldn't stifle my excitement about the quality of the food--I audibly squealed with happiness. In my head, my reaction was very similar to this scene in 500 Days of Summer (hyperlink included for your viewing pleasure): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F1Q4IqKFkk .  Dinner was an unparalleled, unforgettable success. Tell Bruno Mars I'm completely cool with being locked out of heaven when food this good exists on earth.

When dinner was over, it occurred to me that Owen Wilson would have been a lot happier about Vince Vaughn's nuptials (Wedding Crashers) if Jeffrey Miller had catered the event. Seriously.  The Philadelphia Racquet Club was absolutely beautiful, the food was high-end, and I'll begrudgingly put on my big girl pants and admit that I'm thrilled my BFF married her soul mate.  Because I haven't stopped thinking about how delicious the food was at her wedding, my plan is to see how receptive my suitable date is to a conversation about IKEA products. Hopefully, Jeffrey Miller can cater my wedding in the very near future....#keepdreaming",2013-12-06 05:25:54

I guess common courtesy, professionalism, problem solving or sympathy towards patients are not in their vocabulary.

Westside Clinic referred me to AHS.  I called to make an appointment, gave them all relevant information which of course included me reading verbatim from my insurance card the type of insurance I had.  Made my appointment for 2 almost 3 weeks later, came in today, and upon inspection of my insurance card- oh we don't take this type of insurance.  Really?  That would have been useful information 3 weeks ago... Called Blue Cross and sure enough, this group not in my network.  

I asked the receptionist if I could speak to the office manager, just to say it would be helpful in the future if you reiterate to your staff the importance of double checking/confirming this simple question.  She said sure, another receptionist who said she answered my call said I told her I had Blue Shield.  I said very doubtful as I always have my card on hand and let them know everything they need.  She then said Westside Clinic told them Blue Shield, and basically argued with me about who said what, rather then saying, I apologize for the inconvenience, anything that would show an ounce of concern that I had basically wasted my morning, and yes, still in pain.  

Am I wrong to calmly ask for everyone to take a moment to cross their t's and dot their i's?

Apparently there's some weird culture of healthcare receptionists who haven't a clue how to speak to patients.  

I then called Westside Clinic, asked why they would have referred me to doctors who weren't in my network, considering they make a copy of my card every time I go them, and if they would kindly double check to make sure they're referring to the proper doctor.  The woman who answered at the call center at Westisde Clinic, goes on of course mentions nothing about the inconvenience, then resolves to blame ME for not double checking when I made the appointment if what Westside Clinic gave the correct info, wait, what?  I didn't know I had to double check a scheduler's job?  Isn't that that person's JOB to make sure they place me with the right network?

Our meal at Zahav was easily in my top three meals of 2014, beat out only by Rose's Luxury in DC and Ink in LA. 

The food was beyond excellent. I just spent six months living in the Middle East and ate more than my fair share hummus; Zahav's blows all other hummuses (hummi?) out of the water. I'd never had warm hummus until our meal at Zahav but I highly, highly recommend giving it a shot. It brings out flavors that would otherwise be overlooked by the palate. 

The timing of the meal was the one element that was lacking. I wouldn't have even minded having somewhat extended waits between courses except that the temperature felt like an arctic cold had swept in and, given it was August, I hadn't brought a down parka with me. Had we had the beverage we had ordered to distract ourselves from the cold it may not have been so bad but between the wait and just how painfully cold the restaurant was, I have to dock it half a star.

After our initial and promptly served round of cocktails (I had the Desert Rose with gin, hibiscus, grapefruit, and cucumber), we went for a pitcher of the very summery Lemonnana (Jim Bean, muddled mint, fresh lemon, verbena) and waited for it to arrive. Our food courses came and went and still we waited. It doesn't take that long to mix four ingredients yet we waited some more. We were close to the end of the savory portion of the meal by the time it arrived and, since there were only two of us, we had to drink faster than preferred to remain on course with the meal.

We began with the Masbacha - the warm chickpea hummus. Unknown to us, this came accompanied by six small veggie side dishes. Seeing the spread of food before us, we knew that we probably shouldn't have ordered that in addition to the ""taste of Zahav"" menu for each of us. Regardless, it was delightful and the veggies were a nice treat with everything tasting very fresh.

Zahav allows you to create your own tasting menu (two mezzes, one grill, one dessert for $42) which was perfect since we were able to try a sizable portion of the menu. Our four mezzes were the crispy grape leaves, fried cauliflower, Yemenite beef stew and konafi (cheese cubes). The first three were fabulous but we both found the konafi to be unpalatable. Justin ate a couple bites but I was done after one and only reluctantly swallowed that down. The GM inquired about the nearly-full plate and we said that we were glad to have tried it - it was certainly unique - but neither one of us cared for it. He insisted that he would bring us another dish of our choosing. We politely declined, afterall we were the ones who chose it, but he insisted and brought us the watermelon, feta and black olive salad. This ended up being the best of the five mezzes we had and we were very thankful for the generosity of the GM. 

For the grills we had duck and kofte, the latter being my favorite. And for dessert Justin chose the black forest mousse and I had the white chocolate custard with watermelon and hazelnuts. I generally dislike fruit in dessert but this dish blew me away. This was the best dessert I had all year and it was beautifully plated. 

Some of the menu here is seasonable but there are staple items that remain all year around. Regardless of what is on the menu when you visit you're sure to find a bunch of winning items...just remember to bring a sweater despite the temperature outside.",2015-03-29 12:04:28

That excitement quickly turned to terror when they shot down my first 5 ideas close to the house we were staying in. I opened up the radius of the search a little bit and came across Prohibition Taproom. I checked with one my most trusted allies (Cassie G) and when we both gave a silent nod in the back seat of an SUV, we made a decision that would change the course of 5 lives. Ok, it was just dinner, but it was pretty amazing.

The plates are small and meant to be shared. So we got a ton of things:

Smoked Beef Fat Popcorn: I wish they bagged this. It would take Netflix & Chill to a whole nother level. These were delicious and I couldn't stop eating them.

Wild Mushroom Gratin - Maybe my favorite thing we tried. Cheesy mushrooms, the flavor was great.

Mac & Cheese - another solid option, but I didn't love the noodles they used.

Tar Tar - these little sliders were the biggest hit at the table. I wasn't a huge fan of the bread, but my co-workers were kind enough to finish off the leftovers.

Green beans - ok maybe THIS was my favorite actually. Tempura fried green beans with a delicious, creamy sauce to dip. I admit I ate most of them. Extra nice to find a green bean-less chunk of tempura, dip it, and devour it. So good....maybe not for you, but tasting.

Roll Mops: Pickled herring. The waitress said it was her fav, but it received mixed reviews from our group. Bottom of the list for me =/

Pickled Plate: A couple pickled veggies. They were a nice snack option, but obviously a lot more basic than the other dishes.

Pork Belly Potato Skins: These were good. Really good. It comes with two pieces...we chopped them up so everyone could get a bite - so they are a little hard to share. Might want to get 2 orders of this one.

We also got some cocktails. It was solid, but I should have done a beer with dinner instead. I'm weird about cocktails with dinner for some reason. Service was great - except that all the dishes came out at once. I'm used to tapas/shared plate style places staggering out the dishes...I guess that's not exactly the concept here, but it would have been nice to have them come out in waves...as a ton of dishes came out at once and we were all overwhelmed by the yumminess in front of us.",2016-08-17 18:55:49

As we pulled closer, we almost turned around because cars were parked outside of the building all along Tyson Ave.  I really worried it was going to be slammed.   I pulled my husband up to the front to check on the wait. 30 mins for outside overlooking the water and no wait inside.  We definitely wanted outside and 30 mins didn't sound too bad.     Perfect for a cocktail on the water until our table was called.  What I didn't realize was that valet was free and they just work on tips so there is no need to park all the way down Tyson. 

I entered and ordered two mojitos.  The first two were absolutely perfect. Not too sweet, which is usually why I don't order them often.  They were refreshing on this balmy evening. 

We bellied up to the outside dock area overlooking the water and the yachts.  No more than 15 mins, our table was called. 

Sitting outside feels like you are on vacation.  I know,  I live here. I live on the water actually but there is something about a refreshing mojito, conch fritters and a water view that transports the end of the week into something sublime. 

Onto the food - we ordered a perfectly cooked batch of conch fritters. Crisp, great sauce & lots of the chewy bits of goodness. 

For dinner I ordered a side chopped salad.  Very fresh and packed with avocado, black olives, feta cheese and a citrus vinaigrette.  It was almost like a tropical greek salad if that makes sense.  I also tacked on an order of perfectly seared scallops.  4 large plump scallops in a very tasty but not overpowering sauce. This was an appetizer but I made it my dinner with the side salad. It was more than enough and I didn't feel overly guilty. 

My husband ordered grouper grilled with a mango salsa and a side of fries.  The grouper was real and cooked very well.  Usually restaurants have a tendency to overcook fish and it gets dry. It wasn't the case here which was perfect.  His fries were massive hand cut potato spears doused with olive oil and sea salt.  I would lie if I said I wasn't eyeing them all evening.  There wasn't a bite left on his place. We ordered two more mojitos during dinner and they tasted a bit sweeter.  They weren't as perfect as the first two so it seems someone else made them but they were still very refreshing. 

All of the food around us looked good and fresh and I will definitely be back soon and try some of their other items.",2013-06-16 05:34:04

We got quite a few dishes some were good,
Some better than others. Overall it was a good experience. I'm glad we came, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place to others. At the end of the night we spent about $200, and to be honest, I've had so many better meals for a fraction of the price. But that being said, A for effort and service.

Love is in the Air (mocktail) and Old Fashioned. I liked my mocktail very much and thought it was very unique. This would make a good gin cocktail too. My husband loved his old fashioned as well, but not worth the $26.00 for each one.

They brought us out some homemade Parker rolls served with their honey lard butter that they make in house. Best part about these rolls sesame seeds and salt on top. The butter tasted like your run of the mill butter, nothing to come back for.

Next we got the Cornmeal fried oyster, greener roots romaine, ramp remoulade. This was served like poboy, in a little roll. The oysters we're perfectly crispy, the rolls were buttery soft and the remoulade added the perfect to round it all out. One of the best dishes of the night.

Up next we're the smoked chicken wings with sweet potato hot sauce. I'm not a fan of smoked things, but this had a subtle smokiness that wasn't overpowering and added a pleasant depth. The chicken was cooked well, the wings were crispy, and the sweet potato hot sauce was a nice creative touch. But not spicy.

A plate of southern vegetables. The term vegetable is a very loose term here. I was not impressed with this. The vegetables were roasted sweet potatoes with peanut sauce and micro cilantro, sweet potato home fries, broccoli and cabbage slaw, mushrooms (I think chanterelles) with grilled romaine in a chili oil, and grits with  some kind of beer or stout based sauce and a poached egg. First of all I'd like to just note how much it irks me to my core when a yam is called a sweet potato. They are not the same thing, they should not be confused and chefs should know better than to interchange the name. That being said, this plate of vegetables wasn't much to write home about. They were okay, but I wouldn't really go for seconds on any except for the roasted ""sweet potatoes"" (still not a potato). These veggies were neglected and it was a bit of a cop out to double down on the same veggie. The most disappointing had to be the grits. As a grit lover and enthusiast, I think I took one bite and didn't even feel compelled to go for more.

The hearth of cornbread for the table was nice. It was served with a local honey, which was desperately needed. I will say the crust on this cornbread was probably the best I've ever experienced, but I wasn't a fan of how savory it was. Not a drop of the sweetness you look for in the traditional sense of the dish.

The NC catfish, royal red shrimp head gravy, MS Delta  Belle rice, bay.  Fish was supple and moist, but I wouldn't say crispy. The shrimp head gravy definitely came through as shrimp head gravy, couldn't hate them for that, but if you aren't a fan of that flavor then stay clear of this dish, because it packs a shrimpy punch. The rice, unfortunately, was a throw away. I took one bite and didn't feel compelled to go for more. I understand why it was on the plate in theory, but I think in execution it fell flat. 

And lastly, Sweet potato pie with toasted merengue with lime cream cheese ice cream and graham cracker dust. Okay so I have to say I didn't really expect much from this dish, but it was pleasantly nice. It wasn't overly sweet or heavy. The toasted merengue is actually Italian merengue. At first I thought the lime and cream cheese ice cream was an odd pairing, but somehow it worked and they played well together.

All in all, we had a nice time. The service was nice, but I wasn't entirely impressed by this meal. I don't think I'd come back here, even if I lived in Nashville.",2020-03-02 21:54:24
BgPy46UeJrAVCHmH-6GUpA,WcD8zVwenKV5gDHcAIiGNQ,wWsyAQTEgUpcjrLXmHSEiw,3.0,2,0,0,"I had an unfortunate incident here with a service.  However, I want to say upfront that the (part) owner I ended up speaking with, and ALL of the other stylists (except who provided my service) was by far 5 star worthy!  Im disappointed this happened because it is close to my house and the rest of the stylists seem great.

Long story short if you don't want to read the details - Alex (Adian Stoller) does NOT stand behind her service and she rents a chair there, so even the salon owner(s) can't do anything about an issue.  My daughters smoothing treatment did not work, and Alex didn't care to resolve this issue until after I started complaining to the salon owner.  I understand issues happen (no idea why it didn't work) but I expect a resolution offer of some sort (or offer to redo) when you pay that much money for something. 

I just moved to town and scheduled my 13 year old to have a smoothing treatment (for her above the shoulders, frizzy thick hair).  I have had these treaments before and LOVE the outcome.  However, it is typically expensive, so it is a real treat!  When I called, they scheduled me with Alex, since I didn't know anyone yet.  (I picked them based on Yelp reviews).  Alex got my daughter in right away and was super sweet to her.  She cut and colored her hair (to remove her pink tips!).  Then came the smoothing treatment.  It looked great.  Alex charged $50 more than she said she would (for each the color and the smoothing treatment) but I was OK with it because the result was great.  HOWEVER... three days later my daughter washed for the first time.  The smoothing treatment did not work.  Not even a little.  We were so sad.  Having just moved to the area, I had many other priorities so I didn't get a chance to contact Alex for a week and a half.  When I did email Alex with a picture, she simply told me that she was sorry it didn't work but sometimes it doesn't.  No offer to fix or anything else.  I responded and asked if there was anything she could do to fix this.  No response.  I went into the salon after not getting a response from Alex and found out she was on vacation for a week.  The other girls in the salon looked at the pictures and said that obviously something was wrong because it never ""doesn't work"" like that!  They told me they would make sure she would give me a refund (even thought they said they can't MAKE her because she rents a chair... but that given the results they were highly suggest it to her!).   With school starting, I took my daughter to two other salons and both stylists said they had never seen it not work.  I picked one that I was comfortable with (who told me if it didn't work for some ODD reason he would give me a FULL refund - as any professional stylist would, so he said:-).  Needless to say the smoothing treatment worked PERFECTLY!

When Alex retuned from vacation, I contacted her again (because she has still not responded) and asked for a refund for the smoothing treatment - as the other girls said she should provide.  She refused to provide a refund.  I talked to the (part) owner of the salon, Jennifer, who said she would talk to Alex again.  Alex then emailed and offered to try the smoothing treatment again.  I told her I already had it fixed (she was on vacation and not responding/offering a re-do or I would have let her at that time!).  She said she could offer a free shampoo and style.  I was not comfortable with that at this point given I knew the offer was being forced out of her.  At that time, she finally offered to refund $50 (I paid $150 for the smoothing).  I took the refund as I knew that was as good as it would get. 

Again, had she responded to my original complaint and offered to fix it somehow I would have been happy and respected that.  Instead, I got an email saying sorry, it sometimes doesn't work.  Maybe its her hormones.  No offer to resolve.  That to me is unacceptable.  Go to this salon, but pick someone else.  Even when I went in to get my refund, the girl up front was so nice and offered me a drink while I waited.",2014-08-29 21:51:33

Unfortunately I do wish I could say the same about where I bought my car. So most dealerships fill your tank up when you by a car. Nissan of Cool Springs did not do that. I know it's not a big deal but I have bought cars with someone else before and they always fill the car up. Right off the bat, I noticed one of my key fobs wasn't working. So I go back up to the dealership 2 days after buying my car to see if they can figure out why it was not working. After being told that it could be either a battery issue or something that's going to take $450 to fix (again, I just bought the car two days before this), it turns out they had put the wrong battery in the fob. I feel thankful they didn't charge me to change the battery out. So anyway, life goes on... then about a month after buying my car I notice my tag hasn't come in. I call and they tell me I can come up and get a new temp tag as they are just waiting for it to come in (""should be in any day now)"". So I go to the dealership (also note I live an hour away from the dealership) to get a new temp tag, again I am told yeah it should be in any day. So that's a Saturday, then Monday I get a call from the dealership wanting to remind me to go get an emissions test as they are waiting for me to go do it so they can send off for my tag. This was literally the first I had heard of having to go get an emissions test. No one said a word about it the day I bought my car, or the day I went to get my key fob looked at, or the day I went to get my new temp tag... also they were supposed to give me a sheet so that I wouldn't have to pay for the emissions test. I ended up escalating the call and spoke with a sales manager. She assured me she would overnight me a sheet so that I could go get the test without having to pay and that they would send out for my tag as soon as they get the results from me. She also makes note that my sales person Tim ""The Good Guy"" Campbell should have taken it to get the test while we were waiting for the deal to be done the day I bought my car. I remember though he was too busy playing with his new ear buds to be able to do that. Anyway, so next day comes nothing got overnighted. I ended up having to go get my emissions test out of my own pocket ($9 isn't a big deal, but it's the principle). Now I'm gonna send my emissions results over to them and hope they can pull their head out of the sand long enough to get my tag paperwork sent off. I love my car, I do. I'm happy I bought it. I do wish that where I bought it from had their stuff better together. They sell cars everyday this isn't new for them, they get it together and do better for their customers.",2021-09-28 21:16:18

My only regret is that I didn't find the Clayman Thyroid Cancer Center first.  We found him after my first lobedectomy.  I'm sure there are many with the same story as mine but I hope, with the writing of this review, that others might understand how important it is to seek the best in Thyroid Cancer care at the very beginning and there is only one place to go...The Clayman Thyroid Cancer Center.  My story began 5 months ago, during my annual check up, when my family care doctor found a mass in my neck.  I had the initial ultra sound (which took all of about 10 min), then a fine needle biopsy, then surgery (lobedectomy) with reassurance all along the way that it was most likely not cancer and not to worry.  Well, it was cancer and not only am I dealing with the aftermath of a damaged vocal chord which has made it difficult to breathe, now I am facing yet another surgery!  After finding out I had cancer, my husband searched the web trying to find ""The Best"" Thyroid Cancer doctor out there....and only one name kept popping up....Dr. Gary Clayman.  After reading as much as I could find about the Clayman Thyroid Cancer Center, I knew that's where I needed to go.  Since my initial contact with Dr. Clayman and his team, they have been nothing short of truly amazing!  After reviewing my records, Dr. Clayman....yes that's right, Dr. Clayman...called me on my cell phone (not once but twice), so he could discuss my situation with me.  At best, I was hoping for an email or call from his office, but the call came from him!  What world renowned doctor does that?  Dr. Clayman!  He assured me that he would do everything possible to cure me.  He explained the way forward in his calm...reassuring voice and I knew then, I was in good hands.  His team took care of everything to prepare for my upcoming surgery.  Tiffany tackled the insurance and Jolene sent specific instructions on where to stay and what to do prior to my surgery.  My family and I traveled 7 hours (my husband an additional 22 hours as he is currently stationed in the Philippines) to see Dr. Clayman this past week.  His team performed all the necessary tests so that he could complete a comprehensive pre-surgical evaluation.  Daria performed a comprehensive scan of my neck like none other that I have had.  Charlie, his nurse practitioner, knew my case and talked to us before Dr. Clayman came in and helped us to better understand the path report.  Dr. Clayman took the time to explain everything to us in language we understood and discussed the options for the way forward.  While we decided to postpone my scheduled surgery in order to address my vocal chord issue, I can rest easy knowing that my upcoming surgery will be done by Dr. Clayman and his team.  I am here to say, Dr. Clayman and his entire team truly cares about their patients and providing the best care possible.  They are world class!!!  I highly recommend that anyone facing the possibility of thyroid cancer or any other thyroid issue/condition to go to the Clayman Cancer Center and receive the best care possible from the very beginning!  I know that if I had seen Dr. Clayman first, I would have had only 1 surgery, with no damage to my vocal chord, and would have been well on my way to complete recovery.  I would travel whatever distance required to be treated by the Clayman Center!",2017-12-01 14:18:51

I tried Sushi Cafe for the first time today. I love sushi and poke - and with this restaurant located conveniently downtown, I had to try it. I was greeted by a friendly man behind the register and a not so friendly looking ""chef"" behind the poke bar. I asked how the Poke Bar worked, and the friendly man behind the register politely explained that I can pick my protein or do a mix and select white rice, brown rice or salad as my base. I ordered the Mixed Poke Bowl w/ Salad and added masago. 

The bowl itself was fine. It included cucumbers, onions, diced avocado, a little bit of seaweed salad and some kimchi. Here enters the problem, at first bite of a piece of the kimchi my mouth immediately filled with the most foul, spoiled, rotten taste I have ever placed in my mouth. It was beyond fermentation. It was decomposition. It tasted like what I imagine formaldehyde and dead flesh would taste like if you left it to rot in a dirty NYC sewer, maybe worse than that - it was down right inedible and my gag reflex worked intuitively to quickly release it discreetly into my napkin. I picked up the next piece of kimchi to examine and smell it. There was a horrific odor that would make a zombie's panties smell like a bed of David Austin roses in comparison. Gross! 

I picked all the kimchi out and every piece of fish, cucumber and salad that touched it because they were all doused in the offensive odor. 

I then discreetly brought it to the attention of the man behind the register (who appeared to also be in charge.) He explained that ""it's supposed to taste that way"" and shared ""I don't eat it,"" ""When I ask the cook to make one for me, I tell him not to put it on mine."" I respond that I eat kimchi all the time and it has never tasted or smelled rotten and foul. He politely reiterated that it is ""supposed to taste that way"" and that they add it for free. I'm sure patrons would gladly forfeit the complimentary food poisoning. 

So unfortunately, I can't recommend this restaurant and don't think I'll be returning. If there was some accountability on behalf of the staff to at least taste the food being inquired about to  assess for freshness and/or rectify the problem, I might have been more willing to give them a second chance. But the fact that the staff declined to even look into the food in question and rather said that ""it is supposed to taste"" spoiled and rotten, and that he would not and does not eat it himself, diminishes any faith that I have in the quality of the food being served. 

The unwrapped, raw fish collars and flesh piled on a plate in the OPEN refrigerator behind the register (for the entire 45 minutes at least that I was in the hot restaurant) should have been a dead giveaway that something was uncleanly from the start.

For my sides I choose 2 veggies: asparagus & green beans.  My server Bailey was pleasant and very reassuring about the whole cook your own lobster table side experience so I opted to try it.  
The crab  cakes came out quickly; on top a Cilantro-sirachi aloi sauce with a side a coleslaw which tasted fresh and spicy w/slices of red pepper & cucumber added to the crunchy texture.  I felt the sauce was a bit too much cilantro; and started over powering the crab cake by 1/2 way.  
My Lobster order came out on a rolling catering cart with tapa sized plates for my sides.  It was already steaming hot and Bailey explained she would get me started by removing the tails.  Now this was the first time she was setting up this entrée so we both had a little giggle and hopes that we would be able to get the shells off successfully without having any flying lobster bodies LOL
Needless to say all went very well and the cooking stone was then moved to the table top along with my sides for me to finish cooking on my own. Which I will say I turned out beautifully the lobster had been pre-seasoned so it wasn't too long before I was enjoying it along with my vegetables which were also very well seasoned and cooked to perfection.

The atmosphere wasn't too busy and I was able to get seated straight away.  My table was a combo of a high top style booth with foot rests for back comfort and padded high back seats.  The music was lively and upbeat mix of 80's rock & pop and just enough to fill in the sounds of the bar and other dining patrons.  The bar area was beautiful so many beers on draft plenty of hard liquor choices including Top shelf brands like Hendricks.  There are flatscreen TVs positioned high up to the ceiling along the back wall of the bar as well as strategically placed throughout the dining rooms; even one in the bathroom. Which on a separate note they could use a purse/coat hook more than a TV!  There's also a private dining room  called the wine cellar for parties of 30 or so.   Now not the typical wine cellar, I'm used to but there was a wall probably about 30 bottles presented for display.  

Now for the service was timed well from the time I was greeted and seated to taking my drink order and the taking of my food order and answering a few questions I had about certain menu items. There were a couple menu questions that I had asked her were quite specific. My server Bailey did say she wasn't sure but that she would find out before she said something in accurate which I found very helpful.   She was also most attentive towards the end to offer me a take-home box I need to go drink. This was another good dining experience I would most definitely continue to patronize this establishment.",2016-12-02 20:43:47

We went at 6pm on a Thursday night, and it was pretty dead. Got seated immediately, got to look over the large menu (maybe a tad too many items, but I like some choice, so I wouldn't change it). Most/several items on the menu use local produce/meat, such as the 775 burger my wife ordered. She ordered it medium well, and from what I could tell it was cooked properly, with a slight pink in the center. The meat was well seasoned, however it was dripping grease, and the bottom bun was soaked to the point of disintegrating near the end. It'd be worth lowering the fat content in their mix in my opinion. The fries were over-salted, to the point where some of the salt had to be rubbed off. Might be a fluke, the fries were excellent otherwise (a good middle ground between crispy and fluffy). 

I ordered the fish and chips (cod), which I assumed would be good considering the restaurant has ""pub"" in it's name. Beyond the aforementioned over-salted fries, the cod was inconsistent. One piece was crispy to the point of being dark brown on the bottom, another was nice and golden all around, and the third was flaccid, and broke in half upon picking it up. It also seemed oily inside, so it seems the oil either wasn't hot enough or they tossed them in incorrectly. 

The wait staff was mediocre, as some of the other reviews stated. The hostess did go and service some tables occasionally, and they kept our drinks topped off pretty well, but other than that, we felt kinda ignored. After receiving our food, we got a flyby asking if the food was good, without waiting to hear our response. We were unable to order a root-beer float (highly recommended, smooth ice cream and a gourmet, complex root beer) from our server, and had to ask the hostess when she came by to refill my drink. Keep in mind, it was pretty dead, with maybe a third of the tables occupied, and most of those only half full. 

The ambiance is nice, and the items on the menu seem right up my alley, but this was a let down unfortunately. Especially when it comes to the price, the food seems maybe 20% higher than it should be. A $13 burger it is not... maybe $10 if they reduced the fat percentage by about 7-10%. 

I wish them the best of luck, and I may come back if the reviews come in reliably higher, but until then I have no interest in returning.",2012-01-06 08:14:05

Complain #1: I scheduled a couple day spa which included the use of the jacuzzi hot tub, a couples massage and lunch. The hot tub was the first service we received. The water was ridiculously hot. I am the type of person that loves a hot shower but the water in the tub was almost boiling hot. The receptionist didn't know how to use the remote control to control the bubbles, the tub had to be basically emptied and then filled up. By the time they fixed everything it was time for the massage. The special surprise that I had planned for my boyfriend was pretty much ruined. 

Complain #2:  I became a member of the spa and selected the the VIP package membership.

 I went to go get a oxygen facial. When I went to check out, I was charged full price (minus 15% with my membership discount) for the oxygen facial. 

I asked the receptionist why I was being charged full price when an oxygen facial falls under the advance skin care which is part of my membership. The facial should have been $79.

The receptionist explained to me that the hydra facial AND the oxygen facial are excluded. 

On the pamphlet that was provided when I signed up for my membership, it only describes that the hydrafacial is excluded NOT the oxygen facial. 

The receptionist explained to me that those are old pamphlets and the new ones haven't arrived yet. 

They provide the wrong information to the clients and then expect them to pay the full price. 

Complain #3: with my VIP membership I get a glass of wine and I can use the sauna. Everyone I have called to make an appointment I request to use the sauna prior to my massage and every time I arrive to the spa the sauna is NOT turned on so I have to wait for the sauna to get hot. I'm NEVER offered a glass of wine, I always have to remind them to give me one and the last time I had an appointment I asked for a glass of wine and the receptionist never brought it to me. The lack of detail is unbelievable. It's called a VIP membership because that's how your clients should be treated. 

Complain #4:  I requested to cancel my membership. I was going here for approximately 6 months and was trying to give it a chance but the customer service is just awful. The blonde lady that is usually the receptionist seems like she's so lost sometimes and hardly know the answer to anything. 

I sent an email to the email address on the website requesting to cancel my membership. I received a response that the cancellation has been received and the last payment would be in August.

What happens at the beginning of September.... I get charged for the membership that is supposed to be cancelled. I'm not mad, I know errors happen. I reply to the email and ask if there was an error because I was charged. 3 days later I still have no response to I call the spa ( this was on a Saturday). The blonde lady that's always lost picks up, I explain the situation, of course she can't help me and tells me that she will have Bianca call me. 

The following Tuesday comes around and I still haven't heard from the spa so I call again. The blonde lady answers the phone and says that Bianca isn't there but she will be in the office the next day and she will have her call me. 

Today is Sunday and I still haven't heard back from the management staff. 

It is unacceptable that a customer needs to wait over a week to receive a response. Either the staff needs to be trained on how to handle these situations or Bianca, the owner, needs to be on top of checking emails and returning phone calls. 

With so many options in tampa I would highly advise you to spend your money at another spa.",2019-09-16 03:09:46

The options on the menu are unique, the chefs take great care in their prep and generally speaking, the quality and flavor of the offerings were impressive.  My wife and I split the following dishes: Beat & Goat Cheese Salad, Dry Aged Sirloin Tataki (wife did not eat), Steamed Egg Custard, Crispy Eggplant, and Slow Poached Halibut.  Again, these were all good and were easily more than enough to fill us up to the point where we both felt uncomfortable after the meal. 

Now, initially, our waiter (the only waiter that night in late October on a Thursday), seemed great and attentive.  He even made some great recommendations which included the Steamed Egg Custard.  He assured my pescatarian wife there was no meat or meat products in this dish.  While I loved it, it was clear this dish had chicken broth in it (or stock - I forget which) and this was confirmed by the chef.  Since we sat at the chef's table/kitchen bar, we saw the chef mention something to our waiter about this issue. In light of his mistake, I  expected an explanation or apology. Instead, we got nothing but a cold shoulder.  In fact, he essentially ignored us the rest of the night except to deliver the bill - spineless, classless, and unprofessional.  Note, the restaurant was less than half full that night. While I would typically take it upon myself to call him out on something like this, I was feeling mellow and genuinely uninterested after that last glass of wine. Sorry I didn't.    

I was not looking to have this item taken off the bill as again, I enjoyed it. Importantly, however, relying on his word, my wife ate 3-4 bites of this dish that had meat product in it which has in the past caused her to become ill.  It's worth noting that this ingredient is not listed on the menu.

Another thing that annoyed me was that the waiter recommended that we each order 3 things, 1 from each column on the menu.  Had we listened to him, it would have been serious overkill as we would have both been ok had we only ordered 4 items total.    

While this rating seems harsh, I mean no disrespect to the chefs who were buzzing around the open air kitchen like worker bees trying to pump out meals.",2017-12-06 18:45:56

I've driven by this place a couple of times, before it opened and was ""coming soon"" and now that it's open. I decided to give it a try today because the Internet at the house with Comcast has been incredibly shoddy.

Sonny's is a charming little shop, with a definite focus on music. There's a small stage right by the entrance door and plenty of seating spread between 2-top tables, 4-top tables, a couple of bar like areas (painted like piano keyboards) and a few soft, cushion seats. I missed some pretty good, live blues music last night, so I'll have to be sure and come back again for a live band. My first thought with the stage though is that it's kind of awkward if you're a new customer and you come through the entrance and walk right by the stage, if a band is performing I think that would be a pretty big interruption (or as people are leaving). They're a bit challenged though with the overall layout of the building and are using it the best they can I think.

They do offer free Internet, two different options. If you're a Comcast customer you can connect to their network here for free for as long as you want. If you're not a customer, you can use their wifi connection and connect for an hour. Since I'm a customer that works great for me, but not sure if that's a lock-out after an hour on the other network or if it's just a reconnect request. I will say it's kind of sad that I can be a  full paying customer of Comcast and get horrible service, but come to a coffee shop and can connect for free and get 16Mbps+ download speeds and 2Mbps upload.

Sonny's has a great looking menu of food, maybe the next time I come in for live music I'll try something to eat. They've got an interesting selection of savory crepes, sandwiches, salads and dessert crepes. Most of these items range from $6 - $9 or so. Drinks are good and affordable compared to other places. The more I look at the menu, the more I think I may hang-out here until dinner time! Most 

I'll definitely be back! If you haven't tried it, be sure and stop in and see what you think for yourself.",2014-06-07 19:43:15

E-Gulls.

I heart the Eagles.

First-Hand Experience: I've seen them play at home, once, and I loved it. It's a great new stadium and a rabid crowd. I wish they could have won a Super Bowl but maybe in the future. Watching them in person you really get a feel for them. They are by far my fave team in the NFC. Wonderful team, rabid passionate fans, great coach and players at the moment too.

Now that I've seen every NFL team play live & been to every NFL stadium (current and former), time to review them on Yelp! I love stadiums! I've been to every cool stadium in the UK & North America, due to my obsession with travel & sport. I've toured America as a musician for 7 years. In that time, I've seen sports games at (or visited when empty, or both) almost every major stadium in US and Canada. I have pictures of most which I'll upload at some point. Also, on future travels, I plan to take new pix, and add more stadia! Watch this space!

***back to regular review***

They have always been one of my fave teams ever since Dick Vermeil was the coach (ok, I admit, I wasn't born then, but whatever). McNabb was cool and who doesn't remember 4th and 26. They gave my dear friend Tom Brady a Superbowl title although it would have been lovely for Reid and Westbrook and co to win one, but I'll be rooting for him in Kansas City too (my fave team).

I don't mind that you booed Santa, I don't mind that you hired Vick (he's very exciting and everyone deserves a second chance), and I like that you are the most underrated team in the most overrated division and you seem to keep winning it all the damn time, and have done for a long time, but still nobody realizes how much better as a sports team you are than the Giants, Cowboys and Redskins combined.

In any case, keep up the good work and hopefully you'll nab a Superbowl one day. It will come (that's what she said). Oh and your cheerleaders are awesome. And LaSean is amazing. And your current coach is one of my faves in the league.

So 5 stars for you.

By the way if you're in Philly, get John's Roast Pork with XS Provolone, go to Reading Terminal Market and get hot pretzels and lemonade and ice cream from Miller's Twist (trust me), and try the Roast Pork at Tommy DiNic's with Broccoli Rabe if you like, also make sure you hit up Nick's Old Original Roast Beef on 20th.

I'm reviewing all 32 NFL teams. I'm not sure why. If you have a problem with that, complain to Roger Goodell. Who, by the way, would get 0 stars from me out of 5. Tagliabue was amazing. Goodell is absolutely awful. But I digress.

A few days prior I had listened to a podcast on NPR about doctors debating the fairness of the pending new law in California requiring MDs to go through re-training every five years to keep them sharp. I really hope that includes all aspects of healthcare practitioners if said law makes it through. 

Having dated a masseuse at the Hilton spa in La Jolla, I consider myself a pretty good judge of what five star treatment should look like. There was a long list of things that made my experience less than acceptable. The most annoying part of the whole thing was that I specifically made it a point to describe exactly what I wanted to the receptionist on the phone before going in. I even said, ""Are you sure? I only have time for one massage on my 3,000 mile, cross country road trip, so it is extra important that it is nothing short of epic."" 

Not only was it not epic, I almost got up towards the end and walked out. All I wanted was a deep tissue back massage. Not full body, not swedish styles, not thai influence, dont want my hands rubbed. Just take your knuckles and pound on my trapezius. I even told the therapist, ""I'm a surfer, so I only want my back worked on."" For wich her reply was, ""Oh, are you a runner?"" ... um what.

So what did I get? 15 minutes of work on my back, where I immediately asked her to use more pressure, because in her words exactly, ""I work on athletes and have a one to 10 scale of pressure so let me know if I should increase or decrease my force."" 

""What pressure are you at now?"" I asked.

""Four."" I heard.

""Can you please just go a LOT harder, please?""

""Oh well im still warming you up because the warmer your muscles, the deeper I can go.""

So I waited. And waited. Had she spent the whole time on my back, slowly increasing pressure and making me ""hurt"" like she had bragged about, there would be no issue.  Instead, I got 45 minutes of getting my knuckles cracked, wrists pulled out of socket, (wich has left me with arthritic type pain in my fingers for the last few days) calf squeezing,  elbows repeatedly pushing hardly on my spine, extra long fingernails digging deep, and most annoyingly,  my pecs focused on for far too long... like literally 10 minutes. That was the point where I almost walked out. I come in with a very specific need and get completely ignored and treated like I know nothing of the practice and should just lay down and let the expert work. 

Maybe I'm just too used to California where practice is competitive,  and customer service is everything. And if you suck at life, you starve. The downfall of people having seniority and comfort in a job that has a steady flow of tourism is that the customer is sacrificed.  People this sloppy and lazy would never last in my town. Now I know. 

I left feeling more stressed than when I went in, felt no reliefe in the tension in my back, and $200 poorer. Almost home to San Diego,  I will be visiting my regular massuse today or tomorrow, after a long four day road trip.

I have gotten it 4 times before at a high end salon. I was assured that this treatment was great and they knew what they were doing . What a #$&^&*(^ mistake I made. Mind you I spend hundreds of dollars on my hair  Keratin, color highlites and hair cuts. All done by a top salon in North Jersey. 
The hair dresser..... and I use that term loosely...Shampoos my hair once . then towell dries it . puts on a tiny bit of product on my hair. She says something like she has to go get more. O,k youre the professional. She puts more on. And Im thinking this isn't like what they did to me before , but she says she knows what she is doing . 
after putting the stuff on she has me sit for 20 minutes . then she takes a flat iron and proceeds to iron my hair. I think its strange that I feel a pulling feeling , but she assures me everything is ok. After that she washes my hair again shampoo no conditioner. Then she blows out my hair . Well I say ""it doesn't look right its dry and just not right"". She says it will be ok after I wash it. And tells me I can wash it the next day. Well when you get a real keratin you have to wait 3 days. 
I wash it the next day and it feels awful, dry brittle etc. I call and short story go there and they tell me  that the stylist didn't put enough product on my hair. and used the flat iron at 450 degrees  and burnt my hair.  I got my refund , went to my good salon  1.5 hours away. They tell me I have to cut my hair and its all burnt . I get a super conditioning treatment and after lot of tears Im out the door looking better than when I came in. My hair is ruined anyway because Hair Cuttery Salon used a hot iron on damp hair with some product in it. I have to grow it out .

PLEASE SEE PICS FOR FULL DETAILS.

If you need a succinct analogy: This practice is like a poorly-run used car dealership where the overall attitude is ""What can I do to get you into this car TODAY"" with very little consideration for IF the car in question is a good fit. Not to mention, do you NEED a new car?

1) HIGH PRESSURE SALES. 
2) EXORBITANT PRICES. 
3) POOR LISTENING. 
4) RIDICULOUS POLICIES.

I am operating under the assumption that this practice is legitimately interested in helping people optimize their health. If that hypothesis is true, then first and foremost--GET OUT YOUR WALLET.

The style/strategy is high-pressure sales for financial, emotional, physical, and time-dedicated investment right out of the gate. And the way they try to convince you is by employing fear, shame, and guilt. 

I have lived in many places during my lifetime, and I have had fabulous, generous, kind, and gifted naturopaths from Texas to Oregon and in between. I have cranial/sacral therapists. I've gone to naturopaths and holistic biological dentists for the last two decades. I AM ALL ABOUT WORKING WITH DOCTORS AND PRACTICTIONERS FOR OPTIMAL HEALTH. 

Once you reach out and they get you on their mailing list, get ready to have them hound you by text, email, and phone until you commit to your first appointment. The initial consultation is $495 for 90 minutes and they require 1/2 up front. Fine. I am willing to invest in helpful services, especially when it comes to my health.

After feeling like I wasn't being heard (please see pics for details) and when presented with the $3040 price for the nutritional program, I told Dr. ACE I didn't have that much money in my health savings account, and I'd want to pay out of my HSA. She said that was fine so I assumed that meant I could think about it and make a decision in the coming weeks. NOPE. When I got to the front desk, all the supplements were packaged up and Brittani was ready to ring me up.

Thankfully, I had the fortitude to say NO, THANK YOU. But it was difficult and there was a lot of:  We can't believe you don't want to invest in your health, Jeannette.

On my invoice after the consultation, these were the charges:
     $247.50 (second half of initial consultation fee)  
     $40.00 lab coordination fee
     $49.00 additional lab coordination for specific testing
     $250.00 a specific comprehensive test

This doesn't include the charges to return to have my blood drawn nor the charges for any subsequent consultations post-labs.

I called the next day and let the practice know that it wasn't a good fit, and I returned the comprehensive test to the office. The comprehensive test was an envelope filled with strips that I hadn't opened or touched. Dr. ACE had taken out the contents to explain the test, but I had simply taken the envelope with me when I left the office. They charged me a 10% of the price of the test a $25 ""restocking"" fee. They also charged me a $5 ""credit card"" fee. 

A week later, the refund hadn't posted to my account. When I inquired about my refund, they told me $220 would be put back on my card with no mention of the $89 for the charges for the two lab coordination fees for labs that never happened. The $220 did post a week after my cancellation, but only after I called to push them about it. I've called once and emailed them three times about the $89, and I've received no response. It should be noted that during that same time, I did inquire about fees for their programs, and I received a response within 24 hours.

To summarize, unless you like an inconsiderate, shame-based, drill-sergeant type practice--STEER CLEAR. I am grateful to know there are very talented doctors with much more ethical, gentle, conscious, and conscientious business practices and bedside manners.

THIS PLACE IS NOT A FIT. My hope is that this review saves like-minded people both time and money as well as pain and suffering. It was an incredibly unpleasant experience all around.",2021-04-27 19:06:14

The restaurant appears small on the outside but it was pretty spacious inside given the layout they had to work with. Previously this space was a Quiznos. The decor was simple and neat, nothing overwhelming or gaudy.

As soon as I heard there would be a local place to get real authentic Bahn Mi sandwiches, I couldn't have been more excited! Sorry Hollister Brew Co., you did great with the Americanized version of this sandwich but we're going to have to go our separate ways. I have had Bahn Mi in many cities throughout NorCal and SoCal and Phamous is definitely my new local fave, especially because they make their bread fresh! I got the Combination Bahn Mi and it was every thing I had hoped for with flavorful meat and fresh crisp veggies. If you haven't had one of these sandwiches before it may be a different experience for you.

I also had the spring rolls and eggrolls. Being Asian, I make these same foods very often and I appreciate that Phamous handmade everything fresh as opposed to using frozen eggrolls as I have seen other places do. 

Of course, I couldn't leave without trying the pho. I got the combination pho which comes with beef broth, eye round steak, well done flank, meatball, and tripe. If you have never had pho before I would recommend going with someone that has, or simple ask the staff for some tips. Pho is a hot noodle soup that is great all the time, but is especially great if it's cold, you're sick, or if you're hungover. The broth was very rich which, again, I appreciate since I never order it out due to having it home made. The meat was cooked perfectly and the portions were great! 

The staff was super friendly and attentive. They made great recommendations and were patient with those that were not familiar with some of the menu items. If I had to give one critique it would be the lack of music. I happened to mention this to the owner and he informed me it was in the works as there were difficulties with the electrical wiring after Quiznos left. Overall it's a great place and I am glad to see a gem like this in Goleta. I'll definitely be going to Phamous again.",2016-05-15 01:27:05

From the pictures posted to Instagram alone, I could tell that their chef/owners constantly change up their menu, and everything looked so darn tasty.

I finally had an opportunity to check it out this past week, and I'm happy that my friend and I decided to check it out on a weekday (Wednesday night) because the space is quite cosy and the bar not quite big enough had we wanted to grab a drink as we waited (about 10 mins).

It was totally worth the snowy trek across town - we sat at the bar and ordered a couple beers as we looked over the menu. Sitting there, we had an opportunity to really soak in the hipster-ness of the place. I wouldn't describe myself as hipster, but I remember thinking that I was glad that I had taken a little time to pick out what I was going to wear that night. It was by no means dressy, but it's definitely not a place I'd wear sweats to.

Anywho, when I go to a restaurant for the first time, I generally go big, so my friend and I ordered 3 appetizers and 2 entrees. To start we had the broccoli, black garlic wings, and a pork belly bun. And for our entrees we shared the yakisoba and brisket ramen. I was nervous that it might be too much food, but we had no problem finishing everything. The wings came out first, and boy were they meaty. Honestly neither of us had ever had black garlic so weren't sure how garlicky the wings would be (and I love garlic), so honestly it was my own fault that the wings weren't quite garlicky enough for me. That being said, the cilantro, sesame seeds, and sweet and savory sticky sauce was delicious and the wings super meaty. I'm glad we tried the pork belly bun, but honestly since we split it I can't really give a fair assessment of it. I think I may have to go back and eat an entire one for myself before I pass judgment. Preliminarily, however, it was as good of a pork belly bun as I've ever had. We both LOVED the broccoli appetizer. To be fair, I LOVE broccoli in pretty much any circumstance, but I thought it was cooked perfectly, and the fresh peanuts and sauce were a great compliment to broccoli's natural nuttiness. I will definitely be going back for more. 

Now, the entrees were tasty and filling and perfect for the frigid cold night that we went, but I can't say that I was blown away. The yakisoba was stick-to-your-bones good, especially with the creamy egg on top, but I didn't think it was seasoned as well as it could have been. The tofu was cooked perfectly, and the noodles not overdone, but it felt like some flavor was missing. The brisket ramen was flavorful and comforting, but I was a bit disappointed by how fatty the meat was. That being said, we slurped up every last drop of the broth.

Next time I head to Cheu Noodle Bar - and there will definitely be a next time - I want to try their miso ramen and other entrees. I'm seriously loving their Instagram postings, so I'll definitely be keeping tabs on what specials they have and try to head over when I see something that looks especially tasty.",2014-01-25 19:46:46
HlA-7SHSj1rQw1Nl0F5psw,g_9CIS_FCOD3tt__mGkZzw,ZeyWule27WepTQ-CfYvs7g,3.0,2,1,0,"I would give this place 5 stars but in reading the other reviews I definitely can remember some of the issues this place has. 

During my pregnancy in 2018, I came here for my care because I followed the midwife Shelley McGrew from her old location (el rio on Congress). I ended up not getting her but I was okay with it. At first. 

I did group centering with Judy. I like Judy but I don't love Judy. Her centering was much much different than how I remember shelleys being 3 years prior. Much less informative, time always ran out, not as much of a connection that I felt. 

They were very supportive of my choices though, all of them. I was suffering with a mild form of hyperemesis gravidarum and they were very friendly and accommodating. 

I had quite a few individual appointments in between centering as well. 
Seeing Danielle P (FNP) was not a great experience. I was in for some medical issues revolving around my pregnancy but not pertaining to it, and she was friendly and all, but I asked her a few questions and it seemed like I annoyed her. Having HG I wasn't able to take much by mouth and definitely wasn't able to swallow pills. I asked if she knew kind of how big they are, if they come in any other form, and she was annoyed I could tell. I asked the nurse a question that I forgot to ask Danielle and she left to ask her. I heard Danielle snap about how I need to deal with it (whatever it was). My mom and I looked at each other like...""okayy...""

Further into my pregnancy, in the last few weeks, I saw Cecilia Dirks for my birth plan appointment. She skimmed it. Didn't talk about my points. Didn't seem to care. Pushed their own outline of a birth plan and then handed mine back to me instead of keeping it for their records which I actually found appalling because I handed it to her to keep for my file, which I'm pretty sure is what's supposed to happen. 
She was also the one who started scaring me about an induction when I was trying to avoid one since I was induced with my first and had a very specific plan for this one. 
She made it seem like it was something that was already going to happen.
She opened the chart like ""so you're being induced at 39 weeks?"" 
And I said ""uh... noooo? Not to my knowledge?""
Then she began talking about how that looks like it's going to be the plan if baby doesn't grow (I have a history of IUGR). 

Mind you, NO OTHER MIDWIFE had talked to me about induction. Not my centering midwife (who was my main) and no doctors. I saw her 2 or 3 times and she talked about it each time. I ended up birthing naturally on my own, so thanks for putting anxiety where it already laid, cece. 

Anyway, if you're looking for personalized care with only ONE midwife/OB, this is not it. You're always seeing someone else and you literally never know who will deliver you. That part always makes me sad.

I ended up at TMC for a hospital birth due to the IUGR and absolutely loved the midwife who delivered me that day. Janna Stefanek is a GEM. Hands down the best midwife they have. I didn't care who it was as long as it wasn't Cece (who I barely missed by a day or less thank god). So glad it ended up being Janna!

The birth center is still a place I love to go to for care, but it does have its flaws. The birthing rooms are also 30+ years outdated which I haaaated. They're very small and drab. 

I want to give 5 stars so desperately. I started out with 4 stars and changed to 3 after talking about Cecilia and the nerve wracking experience I had with her and with Danielle and thinking about the birthing rooms. 

Hope this novel helped.",2019-04-04 16:05:31
W8MHQ9kNqH5IFgBkYP2CEw,9jOEQeWDupyEiXS5gF1-wQ,V7PzZzhM8HAFX6sNmadNuA,1.0,0,0,0,"Names will be changed to protect the innocent, but this is an otherwise 100% true story.

I was in Tampa hanging out with friends. We all got hungry and Friend-1 suggested that there was a place he had been just dying to try. That place was Tacobus. 

Yes, before you ask, Friend-1 and I are still friends... for some reason.

We get there and there is a significant line, which I suppose SHOULD in a normal rational world be a good indicator that the food is better than average. The world we live in unfortunately is neither rational nor logical, as the smell of deep fried sadness is already assailing my nostrils even from standing outside the front door, a scary warning of what is about to assault my stomach and bowels. However Friend-1 assured both Friend-2 and I, that all the food there is delicious, and he's heard nothing but good things.

We placed our orders, and I went for fish tacos, because Del-Taco makes really good fish tacos, and if you can't make better food than a fast food place, than you suck as a restaurant.  

They call out our orders and point to me, as some d-bag behind us describes in graphic detail what he would do at his bachelor party as loud as humanly possible, as every alarm bell in my head was ringing nonstop, but being who I am, I soldiered on.

The girl at the counter looked at me and sayed ""fish?"", I responded ""fish!"", she then pointed to some food coming out and proudly exclaimed ""fish!"", I calmly asked the person carrying what I assumed to be my food ""fish?"", she responded in what I assume to be Klingon spoken by someone who has only ever spoken Greek, but I assumed what she meant, was ""FISH"".

It was not fish.

I really was not sure what to make of it; it looked like neither fish, nor tacos. It looked like a Taco Bell quesadilla you forgot about underneath your passenger seat 6 months ago. It smelled like old Chinese food made in a sketchy part of town, in a restaurant where no one is actually Chinese.

The first bite was not initially repulsive, the massive amounts of slathered on grease and fat helped mask the utter repulsiveness of what I was eating. The rice was soggy Chinese style fried rice, not the good kind mind you, the kind that can only be achieved when your drunken roommate says he's going to ""try cooking something new"" at 1am on a weekday. As the ""aged to perfection"" grease slowly dissolved in my mouth the full ""flavor"" of this Mexi-Asian themed monstrosity started to seep into my taste buds. I started to feel the mix of flavors of every single thing that had been fried in their cookware over the last 5 years, and it was all bad. It felt like the tar monster that killed Tasha Yar was giving me the old James Deen treatment, and it was NOT pleasant.

By this time my dining companions had finally gotten their food. I looked across at Friend-1 and Friend-2; Friend-2 seemed absolutely horrified. She had an expression on her face usually reserved for gruesome car accidents, walking by a hospital dumpster, or listening to a Nat Baimel comedy routine. Friend-1 however, was blissfully munching away at what appeared to be an old leather jacket in a taco shell.

At that point I was forced to assume Friend-1 had no taste buds, and was probably locked in a basement as a child.

My ""fish!"" ended up most definitely not being ""fish!"", it was a close approximation to chicken, but may possibly have been a used deep fried kitchen sponge they had laying around. The pieces were tiny chicken cubes that were yellowed, spongy, stringy, tough, and otherwise repulsive in every possible way. Coupled with the rice that I'm sure was stolen from a nearby dumpster, it was truly one of the most vile things I've ever eaten, and I once accidentally ate a raw shrimp I found on my counter. Friend-2 and I only managed to eat about 1/3 of our meals since we were starving before giving up entirely on them. I, Dave Garreau, failed to finish a meal that I had paid for.

Friend-1 finished all of his food, if I recall correctly.

Friend-1 also clearly has deep-seated emotional issues.

Epilogue: We packed up the leftovers with the intention of giving them to a homeless person, and then promptly forgot them in my car for an hour. When we returned, my entire car smelled like what I assume Mark Henry's singlet would smell like after being used to clean out grease traps at a Hooters.

We left the box of leftovers in front of a bar and drove off.",2017-05-09 23:40:16

I found this place thanks to Craig LaBan and it really sparked my interest when I learned that Chef Jimenez was a part of the Vetri family that ventured out on his own. The credibility is there because as soon as you walk in, you see a bunch of Vetri and Italian books on the counter top. Also, Mexican food is my kryptonite, so anytime there's a chance to try a new Mexican place, I'm in! 

It's a small place that seats about 20 or so people, so don't expect it to be very roomy. Reminds me of El Jaracho if you're familiar with their layout. Comfort shouldn't be your priority here, just great hospitality and awesome food! You'll be started off with some potato chips and a chipotle type aioli sauce. 

On my first visit I got some Al Pastor tacos, enchiladas, and guacamole. OH-EM-GEE! The guacamole is one of the best I've ever had -- easily one of my top 3 from the city! I'll put aside the ones I've had in Mexico in a separate category. It just had the right amount of creaminess, chunks of avocado, salt, and acid. Not to mention, it's served in a stone mortar that resembles a pig! Do yourself a favor and get an order of guac - you're welcome! 

The Al Pastor tacos had so much flavor and the pork still had moisture and crispiness. I would say the size of the tacos aren't your typical size you'll see at most of the other Mexican resturants, they're a little bit smaller similar to Blue Corn and Quetzally. The chicken enchilada was creamy and the chicken was moist. 

The second time I went I got the pambazo and wow, that chorizo is amazing! Get ready for some heat though because of the dipped bread and have some napkins ready. This is where the cucumber lime water comes into play, order yourself a glass! 

Part of the reason it was so memorable is because of the hospitality. If you get the chance, take the opportunity to chat with Chef Jimenez. You'll find out a lot of his past and what he has in store for Philly. On our first visit, after we were so stuffed, he offered us complimentary pig's head tacos! If you're all for semi-sweet, rich in fat and collagen, and adventurous, then you'll want to give these a try. I found out we were able to try it because he was planning on putting it on the menu, so that was really cool to be a part of the feedback. 

TL;DR - Awesome guacamole, delicious Al Pastor, try the pambazo, cucumber water, and really friendly service! Cheap too, starting at $6 for 3 tacos!",2015-08-25 20:01:49

My friend stopped by my work just before closing and we haven't seen each other in a while so we decided we would go out for dinner. We couldn't really decide on a place and the diner is only a few buildings down from my work so it was a convenient choice. Let me tell you, We made the right decision.

 We were seated right away and it only seemed moderately busy at the time we were there.  The hostess was very pleasant.

When it comes to looks it is a typical diner. But there's nothing wrong with that! They had a very extensive menu with lots of wonderful choices at affordable prices. It can also be noted that they have alcohol as well, though we did not choose to partake. 

 The waitress came over right away and took our drink order. Now since my friend and I had a lot of catching up to do it took us quite a while to order. The waitress was not only friendly, but very personable, kind, patient and understanding. She stopped in a check on us periodically as we chatted. We went ahead and ordered some soups. I got the snapper soup which was pretty good. My friend got the French onion and it honestly looked like the most picturesque bowl of soup you can imagine. They do not skimp on that delicious melted cheese.

We finally ordered our meals, my friend got a pasta special and I went with my favorite choice a bagel with lox and all the Fixin's. The food arrived very quickly. The portion was extremely generous of the lox.  Nice thick bagel and Philadelphia cream cheese. Came with cucumbers lettuce tomatoes the whole works. I loved every bite. My friend quite enjoyed her pasta, no leftovers! 

 I have been going to diners my entire life and I have also dined at some of the most expensive restaurants in all corners of the world. I am not exaggerating when I say that the service that we received was to be compared with the best. The cashier was extremely pleasant and just as personable as the waitress that served us. It is easy to see that the people here enjoy their jobs.  I work in the community that this diner is located in and I think they're an absolute asset.

I'm delighted to be able to write this review of one of the best diners if not the best diner in New Jersey. I'm just sorry it took me this long to stop by! This diner embodies all of the best qualities that makes a diner a diner.",2018-11-27 02:25:19

The food has been consistent and good, we even spoke to one of the cooks today who came out and asked how everything was, and we were pleased to report back with two thumbs up. The service has also been more on point lately. It's worth saying again, i've been a fan of Pho Long pretty much since they opened, and i've stuck with this place even when i didn't feel like it was at its best. At its core is a really good restaurant and i'm glad it's coming back around lately. I'll continue dining here and will update accordingly.

Previous reviews below...

-----------------------

Second Review: Hate to have to downgrade my review, but my favorite pho spot has been on the slow and steady decline for a year or so now, really ever since Anne left. Lately, it's been difficult to get our group seated together, which saddens me b/c i've been going w/ the same people for the past 7 years (since their old location next door) and now they expect us to split up amongst different tables. They've stopped accommodating split checks (this hasn't been a personal issue yet) which just seems like a poor choice for a lunch crowd (this is why i stopped going to Momo's). We constantly have to go back to the counter to request waters, napkins, chopsticks, etc., the service is so inattentive and impersonal now ... this update really isn't written with spite, malice or revenge ... it's really sad to me, i have so many memories of awesome lunches with my friends here and it's like they're dismantling everything that was good about the place slowly but surely. The food is still fine, but service makes a place great and i can only hope it makes a comeback here. Also, still no wifi? Come on guys! See my previous review below to see how far my opinion has fallen, bummer.

-----------------------

First Review: I've been going here at least once a week for the last five years, even before they moved from next door in their old location. Pho Long has my favorite bowl of pho in town, great spring rolls, egg rolls and gyoza too. Haven't tried much else of the menu because I like my staples so much I can't seem to deviate from them! 

The staff is also awesome, they know mine and my group's orders (with each having their own peculiarities) by heart, I've had many lengthy and friendly conversations with many of them and it feels like home every time I eat here. Pho Long for life!",2017-11-02 18:06:56
FSJ1x8pz3CSLlsdkyCDlJg,KMuAiXP_S5UHzf5mHw5SaA,aQhn4CcEJokY6ADxUbzTaQ,4.0,2,1,0,"Went to this location of Chickie and Pete's after picking up brother and sister-in-law from the Philly Airport.

Let me say that I'm an insider and an outsider here. I have family in the area, and I know what is generally considered ""good"" by them. 

I'd never heard of Chickie and Pete's. I didn't know this was a flagship location. I literally Yelp'd lunch in the area, and this place was close by. 

We walked in and were instantly seated by a hostess. Our waitress came over and gave us a nice intro to what the place was about, and explained how our food would be delivered: When it's done, we bring it to the table.

They don't hold tickets at Chickie and Pete's, and I thought that was a unique plus, especially after having worked in a kitchen. Yes, the waitstaff runs a bit more, but the food shows up fresh.

My brother grabbed a beer, as did I. A belgian each.

Then we settled in on the menu. I was not prepared for the portion size we received. 

My sister-in-law ordered the mussels red. A plate full. My brother, a bleu cheese burger, or their approximation of that sandwich. Me, I ordered the boiled shrimp cocktail and some crab fries for the table.

It was all excellent, and out in under fifteen minutes.

My shrimp cocktail was so spicy, I didn't even bother with the cocktail sauce, as I normally would. Clean, excellent shrimp, without a vein (intestines) to be found. Still had to peel it. But hey, we're in a sports bar.

SIL's mussels hit next. My jaw dropped. For ~$12, she had a plate of mussels that the table combined could not finish. Really, it was stacked that high. Fresh tasting (although, mussels always are fishy tasting to me).

Finally, my brother's burger arrived. It was so big he couldn't finish. He ordered it Medium (or at least as close as they were able to deliver, by law). Excellent.

Now, for the infamous crab fries. Everybody seems to love these, but I'm just not that impressed. The cheese sauce is excellent, but there's just something it's not hitting.

Service was very good throughout, and at no time were our drinks unfilled. 

A note: We showed up on Saturday, during the pre-game shows. There was a hockey match on at the time, but it wasn't a Flyers game for maximum loudness and insanity.

It was loud  and getting crowded, but once again...IT'S A SPORTS BAR.

It's not a vegan, farm-to-table eatery.

It's not the Whole Foods cafeteria. 

It's not even listed as a heart healthy option.

If you want to watch sports and have healthy, unfried, or meat free menu options, then I suggest you order in, and invest in a big screen television and an audiophile quality sound system.

Chickie and Pete's is on my list to revisit. 

Give this location a shot, at least, when you're in the mood to watch a game, drink a beer and eat bar food.",2014-05-06 19:29:29

My roommate and I signed a 13-month lease in April 2016, for a 'classic-style' 2 bed/2 bath apartment home (Alara's non-upgraded yet lowest priced unit) for $1,250/mo. We were not permitted to see the actual unit until our move-in date, so we just expected it to be a basic, non-upgraded unit - which is what we signed for as well as what our rent was based upon.

On the day we moved in, we walked into an apartment with granite counters, new carpet, and new cabinetry. Apparently, there had been upgrades done to this unit that somehow nobody knew about, so it was priced as a classic-style unit. Although the upgrades were a nice surprise at the time, both my roommate and I asked how this would affect the price in rent after our lease was up, seeing as we didn't go through all the work of moving into a new apartment to only live there for a year because of a drastic rent increase (the 'classic style' units were priced around $1,250 whereas the most upgraded units started at $1700). 

To make a long and drawn out story much shorter, we were going to try to just stay a year through the lease, but quickly realized that even the lowest of rent wouldn't compensate for the paper thin walls, rude neighbors (who, if you walk too loudly might bang on their ceiling), and uncaring attitude of staff - aside from the manager, Jennifer who was as helpful as she could be but had no real authority due to upper management at RAM Partners, who owns the property. There's also a rule about maintenance having to give 24 hours notice before coming into any unit to do 'mandatory work' such as chimney sweeping, changing the air filter, and who knows what else, however, there were multiple occasions when there was no notice and I would come home to a note in my apartment saying maintenance had been there. It honestly felt like living under an RA in a college dorm where they can enter whenever they want, not to mention it freaked my dog out that some stranger came in when nobody was home.

My roommate and I ended up finding someone who was looking for a short-term lease to take over our lease after only 4 months of living at Alara. We were only able to have someone take over our lease after obtaining permission from Alara - who only agreed to do so because of the original screwup on their part. 

Save yourself a lot of frustration and don't move to this complex or any other apartment community that is managed by RAM Properties.",2016-10-06 14:52:31
vH2UpQjk4AgrBogoRF9ZXA,BtdqTErMCjvrQxKmBlJ7Uw,x4jqqs-Hr7YXYJEqXVTR8w,4.0,0,0,0,"Ordered from this deli tonight on GrubHub. I'm from Philly, house sitting for my parents, and wanted to order something that felt like South Jersey to me. So, naturally, I get a hoagie. It was an arduous process deciding where to order from because I absolutely hate driving and delivery was a must. This spot had two great reviews for Indian food which sounded interesting to me, so I gave them a try.

I ordered the American cold hoagie combo with chips and a soda and a 2pc samosa. I really didn't need all that food just for myself, but after seeing the reviews about indian food, I felt a little obligated to try something other than the sandwich. I received a call from a friendly woman after placing my order that they were out of chips and the soda I requested, so she was able to substitute fries and a different soda. She also asked how I wanted the hoagie - apparently if you order without specifying, it's literally just bread, meat, and cheese! Good to know. I told her to load it up with lettuce, onion, tomato, and extra mayo.

The food came much faster than grubhub estimated. I had indicated contactless pickup, but the delivery guy still came to the door and waited for me to answer to hand off the food. He was super friendly as well, so I didn't mind. I just felt bad that I hadn't grabbed a mask before answering the door because I thought he would have put the food down and stepped away. I'm really not used to people being so friendly, haha. Philly is the city of brotherly love and all, but we are antisocial and don't like to make eye contact. This was different. 

The samosas were delicious. I've never had one before so I didn't have any expectations. The green sauce smelled spicy so I used the brown sauce for dipping and I think there was cinnamon in there? I liked the crunch. It was like an Indian perogi with tons of flavor.

The hoagie was okay! Not the best hoagie I have ever had in my life, but certainly not the worst and still better than wawa. I added more mayo from my fridge. It just didn't taste like it was made with the same love as the samosas, or maybe I was so impressed with the samosas that the hoagie seemed bland? Hmm.

The fries were perfect. Super crisp and crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside. Absolutely perfect fries for my taste.

I was super full after eating everything but half the sandwich, but I am satisfied. I would definitely recommend this spot and/or try some more indian dishes if I am ever in the area with a hankering again.",2020-10-09 01:09:43

With high expectations, we ordered Steak Frittes and we were told that unfortunately they had just sold their last steak, it happens! So my husband opted for the Cornish Game Hen and I ordered a Panzanella Salad and some Fries and a glass of Cinder Syrah. The wine was a good choice. The Panzanella Salad was far from authentic, but was more of a simple mixed greens salad with tomatoes and mozzarella wedges, croutons and balsamic vinaigrette drizzle, however it was tasty for what it was. The fries were hot and fresh and were garnished with rosemary and Parmesan with a dipping sauce. My husbands Cornish Game Hen came to the table and was visually appealing, with a base of roasted veggies and potatoes. After cutting into and taking his first bite of the hen, my husband was disgusted to see the hen was RAW! The inside was barely warm and bloody! He had already eaten veggies and potatoes on his plate which was alarming as we were now seeing blood on his plate! We waited for your server to check in with us so we could alert them of this health hazard and even tried flagging her down with no response. She waited on people around us and never bothered to check on us, even though we were not eating our food and were trying to get her attention. I finally brought our plate inside and told our server to have the cook get a thermometer as this bird was raw. I returned to our table waiting for some sort of response. After a couple more visits to other tables and getting a bottle of wine and two glasses for the people at the next table, she casually stopped by, with wine and glasses in hand, and said ""I'm sorry, I took it to the cook and he admitted his mistake"". I told her I was not interested in finishing my food as we had lost our appetite. She said ""you just want to cancel Cornish Hen, is there anything wrong with the rest of your food"" I told her ""no"" but we just didn't want my husband to sit while I ate. She responded ""it's not my fault""  She then went about her business again, avoiding us totally as we waited for some sort of check (for the the glass of wine I had at the very least). She never returned to our table, I had to once again go inside and ask if I could pay what we owed. She said she was going to comp our meals, however I insisted upon paying for the wine. Again, we were told the cook had admitted his error. As a chef in town, I just want the owners of The Grape Escape to know that errors and mistakes happen, that is not the issue here. The issue is the way it was handled by the server. It seemed as though she would rather avoid us then deal with serving potentially dangerous food to us. No ""fault"" was being assigned, we just wanted someone to acknowledge the serious nature of serving raw poultry, on a dark patio where it could very easily be missed until the patron is in hospital suffering from salmonella poisoning.",2012-09-09 04:26:17

I usually opt to stay at the hotel for the ""convenience."" My latest experience was absolutely the opposite of ""convenience"" and probably one of the worst hotel experience I've ever had. 

The Crowne Plaza's check-in time is 4pm, and I arrived at 3:55. I was here for the convention, and had already missed some of it due to prior commitments earlier in the day; I hoped to check in immediately, drop off my things, and then go attend the convention events. I walk up to the front desk and they find my booking, only to tell me my room isn't ready. Well, okay, so technically there's five minutes before check-in time starts, so I ask how long it would take. They tell me half an hour. So, 4:20. There aren't any rooms available right now (not sure how behind housekeeping is, but given that they accidentally skipped my room on Saturday, who knows?) so I can't exactly argue with it, especially since the room is booked with my dad's points and he doesn't have gold or platinum status anymore. I ask ""could you call or text or e-mail me when a room is available so I don't miss convention events?"" The lady at the desk looks at me skeptically and says ""if you want to write your phone number down, I could call you on my own time."" The implication being that since they don't have a room ready at their on-paper check-in time, they're doing me a favor by calling me when it's ready. So, I'm forced to miss some convention events as I have them hold my bags (and I have to wait for the bellman, who isn't at his stand). I go to the convention and come back thirty minutes later, at around 4:25, only to have them tell me my room still isn't ready. ""Well, how long is it going to be?"" ""oh, about 30 minutes."" ....... 

Okay, so I go back to the convention, dragging half my stuff with me (because with a place as incompetent as this, I'm not going to let them hold on to my work computer). I attend some panels, go to the vendors room, but let me tell you, it's pretty inconvenient to walk around and take pictures and participate in things when you're bogged down with stuff. 

By the way, they never call. I finally walk to the front desk at about 5:30 to ask if my room is ready yet, and low and behold, it is. When I booked the room, I had asked for a room on a high floor facing away from the highway, because I'm ridiculously noise sensitive, so of course I ask what side of the hotel the room is on. 

""Facing the highway.""
I explain that I'm noise-sensitive (to the point where it's essentially a medical condition) and I need a room facing the other way. 
""Well, we can't just change rooms just like that. But don't worry, I stayed on that side, it wasn't noisy at all."" 
At this point, I haven't had a room for an hour and a half, I'm tired, I'm hungry, and I'm angry. I explain, patiently, that unless I get a room facing the quiet side of the hotel, I literally will not sleep. 

So she goes into the back for about 5 seconds, ostensibly to check with her manager, and gives me a room facing the way I want on the 10th floor. Then, as I'm grabbing my key and heading out, she says something like ""Sorry for the inconvenience, I hope you'll give us a good review."" 
Well, here's your ""good review."" 

So, I get up to the room. This time it doesn't have a hole in the wall (as the first time) or a broken window (as last time).

Alas, facing the quiet side of the hotel does not actually allow you any piece and quiet. At about midnight on a Sat night, I start hearing an argument next door. This hotel has no soundproofing, so I can hear it pretty clearly. It's an obviously abusive argument. The man is yelling at the woman, who is crying.  It goes on for some time. I call the front desk. They say they'll send security. I stay up for another 45 minutes, attempting to work. No security comes (given the absolute lack of soundproofing anywhere and the yelling in the halls I would absolutely have heard it). Eventually they quiet down, and I take my ""conk out"" sleep medication because I am not going to attempt actually sleeping in this hotel on my own. 

At this point, I message IHG on twitter. They go through their channels and contact the hotel, saying they'll get back to me the next morning. They don't get back to me the next morning through any channel. 

But I think the final straw is when their ATM breaks. This is a 1000 person convention, and the hotel is sold out. This convention has been planned for months. They knew this many people would be coming, and they knew this convention would have a vendors area. Their ATM either runs out of money or breaks.they get a guy in to fix it, but he fails to, so they start running shuttles to the nearest ATM.

At this point, it's been two weeks, I've contacted IHG multiple times via their site + twitter. I have received no response at all",2016-09-07 20:04:55
fha6hcioMpeqsqxFbAC50Q,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3db1R99-mdSvx3QwryJSNQ,5.0,4,3,5,"After a late night in the quarter and some sluggish traffic on the way back to Metaire I decided to sleep in...until a whopping 6:00am.  With 6pm reservations at Alinea for The Tour and uncertain lunch plans I wanted something filling that wouldn't take too long but would also provide one last memorable experience of New Orleans...I thought waffles and pie fit the bill nicely.

Walking into the small restaurant I found both the facade and the countertop layout to be particularly ""homey"" and pleasant.  With four servers behind the bar and three open stools at the dead center of the action I waltzed up and sat down only to have the two chairs next to me filled seconds later by another couple and a subsequent line begin to grow - it was 15-20 deep by the time I left at 9:15.

Greeted promptly by my server, a short African American fellow wearing a badge that read ""Sleepy"" I chuckled at his low voice, smooth demeanor, and tired looking eyes.  While the name may have fit his look, it most certainly didn't fit his efficiency as he moved quickly around the bar serving multiple persons in multiple seats without missing a beat.  A menu placed in front of me and water and coffee filled I was told to ""gimme a holler when you're ready"" and Sleepy went off to serve other diners.

Browsing the menu didn't take long but watching the expert grill man was definitely a distraction worth watching as he worked griddle, grill, and waffle irons rapidly.  Sipping my coffee I have to say it wasn't the best of the trip, but for the price it most certainly wasn't bad with it's heavy chicory notes balanced by a bold chocolate and woody undertone.  Catching Sleepy with a nod of the head he came over to gather my order, checked off the boxes, and passed it on to the cook.

Sitting back and watching the show that is the waiters at Camellia I have to say I was amused - it is rare to see people look like they're having so much fun working together, especially with such efficiency...it reminded me of Dottie's in San Francisco or The Griddle in Los Angeles, but more culturally oriented and humorous....though perhaps more choreographed.  Watching the look on his wife's face as my neighbor received a gigantic omelet with chili and a chocolate shake for breakfast was another great treat while I waited a short 15 minutes for my first dish to arrive.

Brought hot off the waffle iron (irons that look to have been through a war in addition to the hurricane) and placed before me with a ""there ya go - and here's the cane syrup, ignore that maple stuff"" my pecan waffle looked quite unlike the fluffy buttermilk waffles I was familiar with but moreso like a 50/50 mix of dough and pecans - crisp, golden, and flat.  Topping the waffle with the liquid butter (recommended by another server over the hard butter) and the cane syrup and proceeding to take a bite I was surpised by the texture - fluffy and nutty to mastication and actually quite delicious on its own, but even better with the syrup and butter.  Not overly filling on its own despite its large plate size I was quite happy with the waffle - though it had no chance to trump what followed.

After taking a seat and ordering more waffle I'd asked if the Pecan Pie was available so early in the morning to which sleepy said ""it's never too early for pie"" and while eating my waffle I watched sleepy cut a sizable slice from the refridgerated pan and hand it to the grill man who subsequently placed it top down on the hot buttered grill and allowed it to cook for approximately 5-6 minutes until the buttery pecan and cinnamon smell was evident even at my seat.  Flipping it off the grill onto a plate and passing it off to Sleepy he noted ""HOT PIE COMING THROUGH"" loud enough for all to hear.  Presenting the plate to me he said ""Hot Pie - but it looks naked...what this needs is some Ice Cream!""  Chuckling and nodding my head in affirmation Sleepy pulled out an icecream scoop and placed an enormous scoop of vanilla right on top of the pie exclaiming ""WHOOMP - There it is!""  Melting rapidly atop the scorching pie the icecream quickly cooled the dish and taking a bite I was quite impressed by both the smoothness of potent vanilla ice cream and the buttery cinnamon essences of the pecan pie.  Eating slower as the pie began to cool I was more impressed by the lack of ""filler"" and the plethora of pecans as well as the buttery crisp crust...from now on I think pie at breakfast will be a vacation requirement.

Thanking Sleepy and his cohorts for a great experience I picked up my bill and made my way to the door where you pay a friendly lady who chalks up the tab based on the checkmarks.  Given the option to tip on my credit card or pay the server cash I simply put another 20% on the card and made my way to the street with a big smile on my face - and a smile on the face of the people waiting in line for a seat - a sweet ending to a great trip.",2010-02-25 04:17:52

It didn't seem overly touristy while we were there. This could have been the season (it's not so busy this time of year). The waiters wear cute colonial outfits and the place has so much charm. They definitely don't make houses like that anymore (solid wood floors and doors, nice molding, beautiful and tall windows). 

It has a pretty unique menu and that drew us there. To start, I had the pepperpot soup. It was my favorite thing. It has a strong, spiced (not spicy but heavy allspice) taste which I just loved. I could have eaten only that. We also tried the duck sausage which was great and can kind of be described as a duck hot dog. My hubby had the turkey noodle soup which was thick and chunky and reminded me of what you'd eat when sick with a cold. Yum.

For my main meal, I ordered the rabbit and noodles. Holy mega portion! I'm not a vegetable fan but  many would enjoy that it was loaded with fresh veggies. It also had a significant amount of rabbit meat (on the bone) and noodles. The sauce was a brown sauce that was pretty good. Rabbit tastes a little like chicken which was unexpected. There is both white and dark meat. It had a little bit of gamey flavor but not overly so. Overall I liked, but not loved, the dish. The portion was huge and because I don't like veggies, it hardly looked like I touched it.

My uncle ordered the pork chop which he said was the best he'd ever had. My aunt ordered the salmon which she cleared from her plate. My husband ordered the trout which was another huge portion and came with four pieces of fish. The food is very rich and filling. It definitely seems more of a winter comfort food place...I couldn't imagine eating such a meal in the summer.

Save room for the dessert! I had the coffee cake which was generously sized, buttery and crumby. My hubby had the bread pudding which had just a small but amazing hint of ginger. My aunt had the chocolate mousse cake which she said was great. My uncle had the cobbler which he said was fantastic.

The whole meal was great. The ambiance was fabulous. The service was just okay (our waiter was a bit blah). Overall a great experience. I'd love to come back and try a pot pie. I'd also definitely get more pepperpot soup.",2013-01-12 03:21:16
kmob-iBEmmVnGgs-SgcZiQ,9XQ2gzfOFp1yt8NuofCDOg,JURX4ptr4YV7gLEUBTRUCw,1.0,6,0,0,"This hotel has some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I called 48 hours in advance to cancel my reservation because my mom had to go in the hospital for emergency surgery. Since this was outside of their 72 hour window, they would not make any exceptions and told me I had to either spend the night or pay for the night in full. All I want to do is be home with my family but now I will be spending the night in a hotel that I do not wish to give my business to, nor deserves it because it is a shame to throw all that money away. 

Not only did they not help the situation, I had to call 3 times to receive an answer and they did not even have the decency to reply for 24 hours. They would not bend even when I offered to show them my mom's intake report as valid proof and this was not a story to get out of the reservation.

It disheartens me that they treat their customers this way and that they cannot make any exceptions, even with 48 hours notice, which is more than enough to resell the room. The general manager brought me to tears with how upset I am over the situation and his lack of understanding and lack of a heart. Even after the emotional distress caused, he still would not bend. To make matters worse, he even laughed in my face (as much as you can over the phone) and had zero sympathy. If I was the owner of the hotel, I would not want this man running my hotel. I hope one day someone he loves ends up in the hospital and someone laughs in his face so that he can know how it feels. 

This hotel brought more stress to my already stressful and upsetting situation.

I would not recommend this hotel for any event, meeting, or overnight stay based on the interaction and lack of interaction with management. As a meetings and events professional, I will also be informing my contacts to not use this property due to the way they conduct business. I would also recommend that they re-evaluate their policies as 72 hours is a excessive amount of time to need to cancel a reservation in advance and does not allow for an emergencies or curve balls that life might present.",2016-06-23 20:30:48

Decided while I was in Philly to check it out because I remember seeing this place as I went to the movies next to it a few months back.  The first thing I thought was ""what kind of name is this?"" So it stuck with me so much that I decided to eat there.

This was a Saturday afternoon around 3.  The hostess, and I use that term loosely, asked if reservations were made.  OK.  Simple question but the next thing is what surprised me.  I looked around and there were plenty of empty seats but upon finding a seat the hostess said that you had to be finish by 5.  For real?  This made me want to eat slower and see what will go down if I don't finish by 5.  If it comes down to being warned because that is how she came across I would suggest a more tactful way of coming across. 


Now that I just wrote above what irks me about going to restaurants I will tell you what, or rather who, made this place bearable after my initial experience of coming in this establishment for the first time.  Our server was Ashley and she was awesome.  Hey Awesome Ashley to the rescue.  She had only been working there for three weeks but you could not tell as she was very attentive and had a great attitude that I wished could have been showed at the door. Hint, hint. 


I went with jambalaya and decided to go with cheese grits, and collard greens as my side items.  I have to admit the jambalaya was pretty good and a bit different from what I am use to.  I will say that this is the first time I ever had mussels in jambalaya and it had the look of paella more than traditional jambalaya.  Nevertheless it was prepared very well with just the right amount of mussels, spicy sausage, crab meat and shrimp to balance it all out.  The spice was not overbearing and killing your taste buds with heat and saltiness.  The cheese grits were just the way I like my grits.  Not soupy but with a little body so you could eat it with a fork.  The collards were good.  They were real greens.  What I mean by that is that I think someone was in the back cutting greens after they washed it in the sink.  Some of you know what I am talking about but some of you who just know of can collards don't know what I am saying.  I did taste a hint of sugar also.  I asked the server who brought the food out for some vinegar.  Five minutes later my greens were still without vinegar but luckily Ashley came to check on how things were going.  I asked for the vinegar and she comeback very quickly and that was much appreciated.


Overall the food I selected was good.  Just from my first experience I would come back for food here if I am in the area.  I just have to remember to be gone by 5.  I will give this place a 3.5 (if I could) but service from Ashley a 5.  I never write reviews this soon but I hope the managers/owners read this to see that great service by your employees are truly appreciated.",2016-05-24 06:41:06
i8yelgHZwWOjpXepKABYdQ,9VdyNBdQbaZTrFDmD49e7A,uL4b3AVzlHJtsZChujNEMg,4.0,1,0,0,"My husband and I always go to the Comcast holiday show and DiBruno Brothers, and we wanted to check out the Love Park Christmas Village as well, so when I saw a LivingSocial deal for a Philadelphia Christmas tour that went to those places plus a few others, we decided to give it a try. While this tour was better than a previous tour we took in Philadelphia, in that the tour guide was knowledgeable about the city and actually told us things we didn't already know, it still wasn't what I expected from a tour you spend money for.

We met at the clothespin sculpture across from City Hall, where it was pouring rain (and continued raining for most of the tour - we apparently are unable to take tours on non-rainy days). A number of people dropped out for the day, so we formed a group of 8 and went with one guide, while the other guide took a group of 4 and waited for the other guests. Our first stop was the Macy's light show, which is a big deal for kids (but actually kind of lame for adults). Having paid money for this tour, I might have expected that the tour company had some kind of arrangement with Macy's to get us a good spot to view the show. Instead, we were crammed in with the crowds and I could actually only see half the display. The best part was the huge, historic organ, which didn't come in until the end. Macy's should do all the music on the organ.

Next we went to the Reading Terminal (the Convention Center), where we learned some interesting tidbits, followed by the Reading Terminal Market, where we had 15 minutes of free time. What can you do in 15 minutes at the RTM at lunchtime?! My husband and I panicked and ended up getting smoothies and Amish pretzels. I can't imagine what people who'd never been there before thought. We walked through the city a little more and went to the Christmas Village. This is a new thing they've been doing for the last couple years, and it was cute, but would probably be nicer on a cold winter night than a warm, wet afternoon. My husband and I got some cider, and we had some more free time to explore around a little. I think I saw most of the booths, but I'd like to go back there on our own next Christmas and really enjoy it. We were also given a little gingerbread ""snack"" (the guide just bought a bag of gingerbread and gave everyone some).

Then we headed to the Comcast building for their holiday show, which was good as usual and included an interactive element at the end (and I think we were standing right beneath the snow sprayer). Then they took us to DiBruno Brothers and gave us a few minutes, which wasn't even enough time to do anything, again, and finally we ended in Rittenhouse Square.

Again, we did learn a few little interesting things along the way, but in general there was no special access, we didn't meet any shop owners or anything, and at the stops where we had free time, it wasn't really enough time to accomplish anything. So for next year, we'll go back to doing our own thing. It sounds like some of the other tours are a little more informative, so I might give Philadelphia Urban Adventures another try.",2013-12-28 18:45:03
iVk9u6fkFMh0qgAMpp1evQ,JuigUrQanTZwMvciZXHcgQ,z4DO84nKcdDNs9cvOlQ5Rw,1.0,1,0,0,"Whew!  Close call for us!! Thanks so much for all the reviews!  This validated my experience just yesterday!!!

We are in the search for a motor home RV and because our travels have taken us via I-4 many times before, we decided to stop by Lazydays to see all these RV options!  It was the oddest feeling, as we were quickly escorted from the front entrance desk to a side building that housed rows and rows of mostly empty cubicles!  We were asked to sit in one of the two cubicles, and so we sat for over 30 min looking at pics on a computer screen with a sales guy.  We had to repeatedly re-direct the conversation (back to RV's) from the sales guy (Gary, I think) and his obsessive need to repeatedly tell us how great and huge and busy Lazydays RV is!  

After we finally politely said, we would like to actually see a real RV (rather than pics),we were takes via a golf cart, and on a scenic route (pointing out yet again the wonder-fullness of the campus, the service, the stores, the campgrounds and on and on......to our first view of the RV of interest to buy!!!  Whoops! When we arrived to the Class B RV, it was one fully equipped excursion van with a wheel chair ramp! Seems like that may have been a detail pretty important to point out!

We then drove around for what seemed like another hour -- with meaningless chatter (by this time I felt captured) stopping at a few more RV's that the sales guy thought we SHOULD like! While of course, totally ignoring the Winnebago, I said I would like to see!  He did stop and allow us to see a few my husband liked (Thor) but said it didn't have a drop down bed when in fact it was sprawled on the front window that it did!  I guess it's hard to know your products when you have thousands!!

So, after a waste of our afternoon time, a very frustrated me, and a husband realizing this visit was beyond recall--we were taken by golf cart back to our car!!

Yep, I don't really care that you have thousands of RV's, that you have the largest accessory store in the world, that you have upteen rain and service bays, 3 restaurants, 120plus acres, service campgrounds for free if you spent over 200K, and that you are the biggest, the best, the most exclusive ever EVER whatever's!  You lost me somewhere long before that--about 29 minutes earlier while sitting in an office looking at pictures on a computer screen!! I wanted to see real RV's, to touch, to feel the space, and yes to buy something for our planned upcoming travels!

This morning as I recalled yesterday, and wondered about Lazydays and if my experience may have been an isolated instance I stumbled on these reviews....whew!!!  I guess we dodged a bullet because it seems that sales might just be the best it's ever going to get at LazydaysRV, and even just yesterday's experience to me was certainly not worth repeating! Good luck you guys!!",2018-07-01 12:32:01
WadF6nGP5vD6vsWqUE0wNQ,xH4wtMFdd4bqAlkq3whijg,iwmW2mgcn2YdirXUHCsgXQ,5.0,1,0,0,"BREAKFAST!!!! This place is an offshoot of the famous Brennan restaurant. I ate at Brennan's when I was in New Orleans long ago, and had a great experience. So glad to try Bourbon House. (Probably named so, because it's off Bourbon Street).

GRITS -- AHHHHHH MAZING...and I normally do not like grits....but this heavenly bowlful was creamy....not grainy....perhaps because there's lots of butter in it. BUT I LOVED THESE GRITS!

BREAKFAST POTATOES -- Whole baby red potatoes. I don't know what the chef does to them...they are whole, they were buttery, they are decadent...they are just plain ol good!

FRUIT BOWL -- Nice...had everything bite sized...and a variety of fruit...refreshing.

COFFEE -- black and strong. YAY!

FYI:  This restaurant is also connected to the Astor Crowne Hotel off Canal Street near Bourbon...there's construction on Bourbon but you can enter thru the hotel OR the entrance off Bourbon...it's open. For the breakfast alone, five stars...but I docked a star due to the quality of the food I had the night prior from room service. Ordered about 9 pm. 

MUFFELETTA -- Ordered from Room Service. A well-stacked series of luncheon meats, sliced, with cheese...and an olive tapenade spread with hard bits of crunchy carrot...it's basically a big sandwich...but not as big as the Muffelatta I've seen in other restaurants...came with skinny fries, perfectly fried, soft inside, crunchy outside. The sandwich was warm and the bottom bun was soggy, too bad...the carrot bits were a bit surprising, a little hard for use in a sandwich....the bun was a sesame bun and had a 'I could have been a cheeseburger' quality...not the bread I've seen or the size I've seen...and it was a bit greasy in feel when held...which surprised me. I believe Bourbon House does the room service too. But don't quote me on it.

CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP -- Ordered from Room Service. Big flat noodles...the chicken though had that herbal taste that seems familiar...like Costco chicken...but I felt like soup and I ate it happily. Just had the cup which was a nice portion. But the chunks of chicken were so evenly cut, it reminded me of packaged chicken breast from Costco. 

OVERALL: Bourbon House is beautiful .... it just glows golden....it's a pretty picture...and expansive...I prefer usually a window view...but in this case, look towards the interior of this place...feels intimate yet it's bright and totally open.  The service is quietly done, not chatty, efficient, perhaps not even friendly, but it's the food and the warm glow of the place....and perhaps the company you yourself keep...I was lucky to have good company. 

FYI: If they are responsible for the Room Service food, it was fine...passable...and I was glad to have it after a long day of convention and sightseeing. But except for the fries, I don't want to be reminded of Costco at a Brennan restaurant.  Hence the four stars. BUT if they don't do the room service, I'd be glad to bump it up to five just for the fabulous carbo loading breakfast I had inside the restaurant proper.

UPDATED THE STARS: Because turns out the room service is handled by Astor Crown Hotel and not Bourbon House. In which case, HEY BOURBON HOUSE, if you don't want to get dinged, make it clear that room service has a separate kitchen. :-D",2017-08-07 06:59:44

Matt had scouted out Melville Winery in advance of our trip--he'd seen the wines come up on various restaurant menus in L.A. and noticed there was a tasting room in the Funk Zone--and we called ahead and drove over as soon as the kid hit the crib.

The space was attractive, with high ceilings, white walls, and a ton of natural light. The decor was clean and modern but still California winery cozy, with comfortable sofas and scenic photographs adorning the walls. The vibe was lively on a Sunday afternoon, but the set-up was nice and spread out so it never felt particularly busy. Service was excellent. A woman named Eryn, whose job title I couldn't really guess at, did everything--poured our wines, brought our snacks, and processed our order. She was knowledgeable and friendly. We also left a sweater and called to ask about it then picked it up the next day. They had it and kept it ready for us, no problem.

We got two tasting flights and a cheese platter with chorizo to munch on with our wine. The wines were across-the-board delicious. That day's flight included the 2019 Blanc de Blancs, the 2019 Estate Chardonnay, the 2019 Estate Pinot Noir, the 2015 Emery's Pinot Noir, and the 2018 Estate Syrah, plus a bonus pour of our choosing (we went for one each of the two pinots). The cheese platter was also fantastic: white cheddar, manchego, and Humboldt Fog served with fig jam, dried fruit, and fresh bread. The flavorful chorizo was well worth the extra few bucks.

We had such a pleasant experience that we joined the wine club at the end of our visit, getting our tasting fees waived and 20% off our purchases. We went home with a Blanc de Blancs, a Chardonnay, and two of the Estate Pinots, and I think we've already drank all but one of the pinots. Matt has also since attended a fancy work function at Spago in L.A. and noticed the wine they were pouring was from Melville. We're big fans of this winery and are excited for our first club selections, which we hope to pick up next time we're in Santa Barbara (they also ship). The wines are fantastic, the price point reasonable, and now we have a place to take friends and drink for free whenever we're in town.",2021-11-11 19:52:47

These unpredictably scheduled pop-ups (it took me a year to cajole Shola into adding me to his tiny mailing list so I can hear about them them before they sell out) are something not to be missed. There is no one in Philly that is cooking anything remotely like what Shola is doing.  Not cheap, but at ~$120/person, it is a bargain for a 4-hour sojourn past the culinary Karman line.

Each dinner has a unique theme, which has recently included ""7 Fishes"", ""Umami"", and ""Spring"".

Dinner is held in Shola's secret lair, a condo in the Loft District, north of Chinatown, that has been converted into a molecular gastronomy open kitchen full of centrifuges and rotary evaporators, with a 10-12-person dining table.  BYOB, although good luck trying to predict what wines to pair (I suggest going with generally food friendly wines like Riesling and Pinot).  Street parking isn't hard, although maybe a bit sketchy.  

I've been 3 times to date (and planning to attend his sous-vide class/dinner next week), including the memorable ""B2D2"" (Breakfast for Dinner #2).   This meal had some of the most unusual food combinations I've ever experienced. Not to mention it was a stormy night, and the view of downtown Philly from high up (this was his old condo-kitchen in the NoLibs), backlit by lightning, was spectacular.

Here's the menu:

Pu-erh Dashi . Grilled Baby Octopus . Sansho
Sea Urchin Pain Perdu . Almond Praline . Celery
Meadow Run Farm Egg . Nori Potato . Roasted Salmon Tare
Maitake Oatmeal . Pressure Cooked Soy Nuts . Parmesan
Oxtail Bacon . Quince Confit . Chick Pea Puree . Black Bread
Foie Gras Bacon . Brown Butter Pancake . Rosemaple Syrup . Kinome
Coffee Cured Lamb Belly . Celery Root . Olive Sugar
Pistachio Affogato . Coffee Foam . Lime Streusel

I hate the trend of listing only ingredients on menus these days, as it really doesn't tell you much about the dishes.  That is particularly true here, as Shola is taking inspiration from classic breakfast dishes for dinner.  Sufficed to say, each dish was a unique mix of unusual ingredient combinations and modernist cuisine techniques that resulted in dishes that were both mind-stretching and delicious.

I went with a very light 2009 G.D. Vajra Moscato d'Asti with dessert, and then a luscious 2001 Philippe Delesvaux Coteaux du Layon Sélection de Grains Nobles by itself at the end of the meal. With the rest of the meal we had a range of wines from Champagne, riesling, pinots, Rioja (for a change I decided to relax and not take detailed notes). The company was pleasant, and Shola was very entertaining (we heard the whole Speck & Philly Magazine stories in detail).

Other dinners, such as ""Spring"" have been less adventuresome, but each dish would not look out of place at the finest restaurants here or in NYC (at ""Spring"", Shola's lamb agnolotti served with celeriac, green apple, spice jus and olive tapenade is one of the best Italian-inspired dishes I've ever had).  I also attended the Ideas in Food collaborative dinner with author/blogger H. Alexander Talbot.

The crowd is always interesting.  I've met TV's Top Chef season 6 winner Kevin Sbraga and his lovely wife, CIA students, super models, and trend-weary New Yorkers down to find out what all the fuss is about.

If you need any added convincing, just take a peak at Shola's food porn (he always has a camera set up to record the dishes he serves):

am_GhWfmdLXklo3DvjdkSg,BYsmhaj1NGPuhvtInL6Kbw,u0Bt7uvvj7LAjAdiMtrhug,5.0,2,1,3,"I've been a fan of Zahav for some years, so when Laser Wolf opened, I was beyond excited. Of course, I live in LA, so it's not as easy as getting in the car, but I had a trip planned and reservations for April 2020. And then the apocalypse happened. Just like that, my visit to Laser Wolf (and I was supposed to go to Zahav too!) was on hold indefinitely. While obviously my canceled reservations were tiny in the big picture, they were still a major bummer.

Flash forward to July 31, 2021: Vaxxed since April and visiting my folks for the first time since the pandemic, I crossed the threshold of Laser Wolf for the long-delayed reservation just before 7 p.m. It's a cool ""industrial chic"" and airy space, and the music rocks (pretty loudly, FYI). My regular Zahav (and now Laser Wolf) dining partner wasn't so lucky when it came to parking, and she circled like a jet over PHL until, with the help of the fabulous Kailey (GM at Laser), she found a nearby lot. In any case, she made it, and that was all that mattered.

Unfortunately, my dining partner arrived in less than ideal condition; she'd had something to eat/drink the day before that had riled her stomach, and while she was hell bent on not canceling because we'd both been looking forward to it so much, she didn't have her usual appetite. Still, because everything was so good--yes, we're getting to that--she carried on as best she could, determined to taste as much as she was able.

Because my dining partner was a bit behind, I had a great opportunity to start getting to know our server, Raven. (Raven, if you get to read this, you are a rock star.) Not only did she do a great job guiding us through the menu--and steering me toward the Salty Lion, which turned out to be a fab drink--but she and everyone else was so kind and attentive that it made what could have been a trying situation, given my dining partner's challenges, still lovely and enjoyable.

So as we worked on our drinks, we made food selections. Laser Wolf is centered around the grill. While there are some a la carte options, the best way to work your meal is to order one of the grilled items, which then comes with pita, hummus and a boatload of salatim (little salad dishes) that they are happy to refill if you'd like. In this case, we opted for the whole branzino for two, which is done with tomato and ginger.

The salatim arrived. It's an incredible spread--10 different choices in individual bowls--with hummus in the middle and fluffy, warm pita on the side. Where even to begin... We both dove into the hummus, tearing pieces of pita to dip into its creamy, olive-oil topped goodness, and then it was on to the salatim. While they were all winners, a few particular favorites: celery and pineapple with schug (I'm normally not a celery fan, but this won me over), cabbage with pickled raisins and amba, the Persian bean salad (wow!) and the zucchini with corn (maybe my fave). It's easy to fill up on salatim, so I tried to pace myself, though I probably didn't entirely succeed.

In the meantime, a few other items appeared. These included a fabulous yellowtail crudo with avocado aleppo crisp and pomegranate seeds--such a great pairing (loved the pop of the pomegranates against the fish)--and french fries with tehina ketchup. Truth be told, I'm not usually a big french fry guy, but these were awfully good, especially with the sauce, which had amba in it (therefore, rockin' a bit of a mango vibe). 

Then there was the cucumber salad. Well, it was cucumber with tomatoes, long hots (a pepper) and feta. Now I've had many a Middle Eastern salad with cucumbers, and typically, they're fine but kind of boring. No boring here. In fact, it was the best dish starring cucumber I've had in recent memory. Or possibly any memory.

That brings us to the whole branzino. It was perfectly cooked, so moist and tender, and the ginger and tomato were a perfect and unique complement. Accompanying the branzino was flavorful rice to use as a base. My poor dining partner tapped out a little bit into the branzino, but not before she'd declared it delicious.

Somewhere through this wonderful experience, I had to double up on the Salty Lion (yes, it was that good), and a plate of beets (accompanied by dukkah) arrived, also yummy.

So what does this leave...? Dessert! Dessert is included if you order one of the grilled mains, and on this night it was brown-sugar vanilla soft serve ice cream with Sicilian pistachio-rice crunch and sour cherry. While I usually tend to eschew soft serve in favor of...well, whatever one calls the non-soft serve variety of ice cream, this is not your usual soft serve. The flavor and texture were fab, and it was the perfect way to end the meal.

I wish my dining partner had been feeling like her usual self, but that just gives us all the more reason to return when she's at 100 percent. Laser Wolf is, like Zahav, a great experience from start to finish. (And the day after with our leftovers!)",2021-08-02 00:27:14

I called at 8am to make a 9:45am reservation on Saturday. My information was taken and that was it. I arrived promptly at 9:45am and was seated, my friends arrived closer to 10am due to the inadequate amount of available parking. Parking is a nightmare at this location. As soon as my friends sat down, the waitress came over and asked if we knew that reservations were only for a 1 hour time period? I was so confused because when I called to make the reservation, the employee failed to communicate this information. Shortly after, a manager came out and told us that we only had 30 minutes left on our reservation. I asked if we were being rushed and he rudely laughed and said no, but you only have an hour. I told him that we were unaware and nobody told us about the ""1 hour time limit"", he continued to rudely say well you should have all been on time for your reservation. (Which is besides the point) Looking around the restaurant, there were still empty tables and the place wasn't at full capacity. After the back and forth with the manager, we were ready to leave after being treated with a rude attitude. The next 30 minutes were rushed, we ordered a drink and food. After a few bites, the waitress asked if we were going to need boxes. Are you serious? 

Let's talk food! I ordered the Veggie Benedict with bacon and instead of English muffins, I added the veggie fritters with a side of hash browns. As you can see in the photo, that's not how it was served. So not only was I limited on time, my order was incorrect and I had to wait for them to bring out my side of hash browns. I ended up shifting my eggs benedict to the veggie fritters, my food was cold by this time. The veggie fritters and hash browns tasted like they had been sitting out for awhile and they definitely have decreased in size. My rush meal was not good at all. 

My overall experience was the worst! With their employees failing to communicate their reservations policy, terrible customer service, unprofessional management, subpar food quality, and awful parking this definitely deserves a 1 star rating! 

Due to covid restrictions, I can understand a 90 minute-2 hour time limit and in my recent restaurant experiences, that has been pretty common. But a 1 hour time limit, you're really trying to rush your customers and not give them an opportunity to enjoy their meal and drinks. What a disappointment this restaurant has become! There are so many other awesome restaurants in the area that offer better food and service!",2021-06-16 17:31:45

I googled the venue address and chose this hotel based on distance from the venue & online reviews. I was extremely impressed. We arrived on Friday evening around dinner time, so glad that the hotel was right off the main drag and only a few minutes into town. The exterior of the hotel leaves a lot to be desired, as it's nothing special. The check in was quick and efficient, and the staff was very friendly and accommodating (I requested that my sister who was checking in the next day be placed close to us). We were assigned our room and off we went. The Atrium looked really nice, although we never had a chance to really check it out. Our room was on the 4th floor (top) and had a balcony. The furniture, bedding, and TV were all updated and modern, and the room was quite spacious. The bathroom was standard, with the exception of EXTREMELY POOR LIGHTING, really my only complaint about the room. It was really difficult to do my makeup. It included some really nice hotel toiletries, but no shower cap, which was weird. The bed was VERY comfortable! We didn't go with the sleep number bed (I had heard mixed reviews and couldn't risk a bad sleep) but the regular king was awesome. Despite being right next to the elevators, we were pleased that the room still seemed very quiet. The doors to the floor also required a room key past a certain time, which I thought was a nice security feature. Underground parking was free, which was great, as well as WiFi, which was not so great. The connection was poor so I was slightly disappointed. There was an internet cable that my boyfriend hooked his laptop up to, and that seemed to work fine. The pool and fitness centre were AWESOME. We got to enjoy the pool and hot tub both nights we were there and it was lovely. The pool temperature was literally perfect and the hot tub was so relaxing. I love that the fitness centre is actually a full GYM. I was disappointed in myself that I did not get to use it (too much wine at the wedding the night before! Haha). The only downsides to our stay were housekeeping knocking on our door at 10AM, but that was our own fault for not hanging the Do Not Disturb sign. Another was their advertised Thanksgiving Brunch on Sunday, which I called down to inquire about. It was $28 per person!! I just thought that was ridiculously expensive for a hotel brunch. Anyway, we really enjoyed our stay here and I would not hesitate to stay again on my next trip to Edmonton. It is close to everything, and really easy to get anywhere in the city. I think the price was a little higher than usual because of the holiday weekend, but I felt we got our moneys worth.",2012-10-09 17:52:11
Dz--uIW9vVnsvlee0Wy5Kw,fJM_1YrTqlVPjgq2_ObDOA,wGjD-JlJmqPuG5oTvxMKGg,4.0,7,4,5,"Just came from there this evening to hang out with friends. Let me start by saying this place is CUTE! So colorful and vibrant, it makes you happy. Even the menu posters hung on the walls are fun to look at. 

With COVID still affecting us, VIVI's adhered to social distancing. The seating (yes, they had seating) was properly distanced. They area is well spaced and clean. People that came in had a natural tendency to space themselves out with out the need for floor markers or being told. So I felt safe being in there. It feels crazy to even add this, but these are the times we live in.

So, onto the beverages... If you're not familiar with Bubble Tea, TAKE YOUR TIME WITH ORDER and DON'T BE AFRAID TO ASK QUESTIONS. They have a menu on the wall, but they also have a small yet very colorful paper menu that can help you choose. I recommend starting simple. Go with what you know and like, unless you came with a bubble tea expert that knows you well. Im not gonna lie, I like bubble tea, but I am far from an expert. 

Their beverages consists of Cream float Series, Yakult Drinks, Milk Teas, Organic Milk series, Fresh Fruit Series, Slush Series, Flavored Teas, and a Special Signature list. Prices are maybe a little bit more than Im used to paying for bubble tea. 

I ordered 3 mediums. Oreo Cream Brulee, Flaming Brown Sugar, Coffee Jelly Bubble. The Oreo drink was very chunky, you definitely need a thick straw for that. I had it with milk tea, so it took away from some of the sweetness of the oreo. 

My eldest daughter had the flaming brown sugar with milk. According to her, it was sweet but not too sweet and tasted like caramel towards the end (she forgot to shake it before popping the straw in). She said it reminded her of a caramel frappe from McD's. It had a good amount of tapioca , but probably could've done with less. She said she would order this again.

My youngest daughter, she had the coffee jelly drink with milk tea. She did not like this drink. She ended up switching drinks with me, so I got to taste it. I actually didn't mind the taste. I was mostly milk tea tasting with a hint of coffee. For coffee lovers, that would not be a good thing. This drink though, it had a ton of jelly and a ton of tapioca balls. Every sip from the straw was like a machine gun of jelly and tapioca being shot into my mouth. I did not appreciate that.

Now, unto food. YES, they serve snacks! These go very well, with the teas and atmosphere. It's a small selection of Asian 'finger foods' but perfect for just hanging out and sharing with your friends. Nothing heavy. They have popcorn chicken, popcorn shrimp, takoyaki, Taiwanese BBQ sausage, and fried yam.

I ordered popcorn chicken, takoyaki, and the sausage. Takoyaki, The best way I can describe is like a seasoned omelet with seafood (octopus), shaped into a ball and fried. If done right, it can be delicious. This kinda fell flat. Mine was undercooked, while it was crispy on the outside it was very mushy in the middle. It also had one bit of octopus, and lacked a good amount of fish flakes that would 'dance' as a topping. It could have used a good sauce to go with it, there was none available, except Sriracha. 

The sausage tasted good, I dont think they make their own so I cant really judge them on it. It was tasty and sweet. 

The popcorn chicken comes in different flavors, pepper salt, spicy, garlic, curry, and basil. I picked curry. I can say, this was the best of all 3 foods that I ordered. Crispy outside, juicy center, flavor was on point. Would go through a drive through just for this. 

Since I was with friends, I also got to taste the fried yams and my daughters got to taste another flavor of popcorn chicken. Fried yams, it's just lightly coated sweet potato fries. It was also good, but yeah..it's just sweet potato fries. The other flavored popcorn chicken was also tasty to my girls.

Overall, I give this place a 3.4, my daughters say a SOLID 4 out of 5. They want to go back for sure. I wouldn't mind either as I would like to try other drinks and I loved the popcorn chicken. I'm also curious about trying out their popcorn shrimp now. 

They also have a rewards system through the clover app where you buy so many teas from them and get one free after 10. The clover app is free to install and has other businesses that you can also visit for rewards.

Note to self: I dont think either of my daughters like milk tea. We will have to remember that for next time. 

TLDR; Drinks were super chunky, food decent, price decent, service great. I will be coming back to try new stuff. Thumbs up.",2020-09-28 04:24:16

Close student community
Walkable campus

I spent four years here as an undergraduate, and wouldn't trade the experience for any other school. La Salle is small enough that you get the personal attention of your professor, but it's right in the middle of a huge city with a thriving arts, culinary and social culture.

I've broken down my review into the things I would want to know as a prospective undergraduate.

Classes:
I never had a class of more than 25, which for a college is fantastic. It might seem like a lot more work than a lecture class, and it is. You will get noticed if you skip classes, and many professors have strict attendance policies. It's nothing like the stereotypical 300+ you might imagine, but that's a very good thing. They offer multiple instances of most classes in order to keep the size manageable.

It really helped me connect with my professors on a personal level, and allowed them to do the same. The environment is much more conducive to learning in an interactive way. I can say that in 4 years, I didn't once feel like I was being lectured at, but rather felt like I was being engaged as a participant in a discussion. The classes are also small enough that, in my major, I got to know many people with whom I had multiple classes, instead of just knowing just the people in my dorm.

Professors:
In 4 years, I only ever had a few professors who I truly thought were not capable of teaching on a college level, if at all. The following comments are directed at those who do not fall into the small minority, as the lions share of those with whom I trusted my education were excellent. Because of the small class sizes, professors seem less 'professor-ly' and more conversational. There are no TA's, and all the professors seem willing to help outside of the classroom to make sure you're getting what you need. Often, I'd find myself in line at the union next to one of my professors and we'd end up having lunch together. It's that kind of school.

The professors here are not second rate just because it's a small school; La Salle has a good draw for professors because of it's location in Philadelphia. I can only speak for my major, but those with whom I had class all had experience in the professional world, and many still worked in that world outside of the classroom. They brought a level of experience to my major coursework that was directly applicable to my post-graduate experience because of their proximity to the material they were teaching.

Social life:
There are plenty of opportunities for late night activity on campus. There is not much by way of entertainment in the neighborhood, so you've got to either head into center city, find something on campus or stay in your dorm. The campus activity board provides something to do almost every weekend, game nights, late night shows, etc. As wel, there are a few student groups that sponsor things (plays, musicals, concerts). While many of the regular events are sparsely attended, they are available if you want to do something besides play x-box in the dorms.

Greek life:
Didn't participate, but it exists. There are no official campus houses for greeks, but several rented townhouses in the surrounding neighborhood provide 'unofficial' venues for parties. The greek life is rather subdued here when placed in the stereotypical fraternity or sorority context.

Dorm life:
There are several dorm locations, as well as townhouses and apartments. La Salle has a large commuter population, but living in the dorms is something of a rite of passage for college. All dorms have a vague funky smell, extra long beds, cinderblock walls, tile floors and a host of stereotypes in residence, and here is no exception. The campus is not dry, and drinking in the dorms does go on. If you're trying to decide between commuting and being a resident, I would definitely recommend the latter. I met some good friends just sitting outside my dorm (Katherine) at a picnic table my freshman year, and you can't get that going home every night.",2010-04-02 14:14:50

I hurt myself a few months ago. You know, one of those ""bend-and-twisted-while-trying-to-pick-up-the-70-lb-dog"" injuries. I saw the chiropractor every three days for several weeks. No more gym. I was devastated. However, yoga was acceptable AND recommended. Yoga Harmony just happened to be the closest to my apartment with a GREAT introductory deal. And I am so glad it was!

I was skeptical. My first experience with another yoga studio was not pleasant. Very cliquish. But at Yoga Harmony I was immediately greeted and welcomed. Rachael was very accommodating and kind. Even during the class she discreetly helped me learn the poses without disturbing the other participants. If you are first time hot yoga, this is the BEST studio to learn. I didn't feel like I was any trouble. I, also, had the pleasure of a class with Nicole one afternoon. She is so personable and welcoming. As soon as I told her about my injury, she knew who I was. I love when companies show concern for each individual client! I was taught a few modifications before class even started.

We all play favorites so I'll share mine: If you want a good push before you start your day, I highly recommend Tara's 6am class. She is a bright light on a groggy morning to energize the rest of your day! Because the classes are smaller at that time, I felt like I got much more attention on improving my form. Each of the other instructors I've had has their own technique so I think everyone could find one they really respond to the most. But all are focused on clients doing the moves correctly, being present, and increasing self motivation. And it makes a difference that they all make a point to learn names! 

The instructors' attitudes are contagious. The men and women at the studio are just as welcoming and kind. Some of them look like they have been doing yoga for decades. Standing next to a perfect triangle or standing bow is extremely intimidating... But the classes are focused on eliminating the competition and reflection on yourself. I left every class feeling proud. And a little stronger.
After 2 weeks and 10 classes, my chiropractor is blow away at my progress. I've only visited her twice since starting classes (once only as a patient discharge formality).  I wish I had found Yoga Harmony before moving. Cannot wait to find my way back to Nashville and become a ""frequent flier"" again. Thank you for everything you do for your clients!",2014-07-25 18:57:21

The hotel is a unique property with a variety of rooms, some with an ocean view, some not. We stayed during the week so traffic was light and the city was relatively quiet.  The weekend is much different, people everywhere, very lively so if you like peace and quiet, this is not the place for you.  I travel with ear plugs and sleep like a baby so i had no problem with noise.  The property is an old but updated, however, if you are there on the weekend, expect to be near a wedding party, bachelor party, bachelorette party, or any party for that matter.  Don't blame the hotel as this is common in a beautiful location like Santa Barbara.  The staff is a mix of seasoned hospitality veterans and some new to the job and still learning about customer service.  I will say I experienced some of the most honest, and willing to help people at this hotel that I have ever experienced.  I had stupidly left a large sum of money in the safe and didn't notice until i arrived home.  I called and Georgina, the housekeeping manager had the money, which was turned in by the housekeeper who cleaned the room.  It was locked in the safe at the office until I could return to pick it up.  I expected that I would not get the money back, and was overwhelmed with the honesty and professionalism of the staff in getting the money back to me. 

When I returned to pick up the money, I watched one of the supervisors deal with a guest who was upset that her room was not upgraded like the others in her party.  She was rude and demeaning when the supervisor trying to assist her was asking questions to see why this happened.  He was incredibly professional and apologetic the entire time while the guest acted like an entitled, petulant brat.  It was discovered that the rooms were booked through a travel agent that had some in house upgrades available and the travel agent was the one who allowed the upgrades and to which rooms.  She then said that she paid too much for her room then, since the other's received an upgrade.  The supervisor kept his cool, provided her a reduced rate and she never once thanked him.

So say what you will about the staff, what I experienced and witnessed was above and beyond!!  Thank you to the entire staff for a job well done.",2017-01-31 00:07:24
aOHyCTv2O5HJbNawY3yghA,ACLqiJm0oofNZmn_0Ch1Mg,8l4ZOvZ42wbf0TNdjiMGVA,1.0,1,0,0,"Delaware Moving & Storage Inc., who is an agent of Wheaton World Wide Moving, hire employees that consist of the most UNSAFE, unprofessional, disrespectful, unprincipled, combative, rude, careless, chauvinistic, and did I say unprofessional, people on the face of the earth. 
(1) they arrived 30-45 minutes late 

(2)When I returned, I noticed two out of the three packers were no longer wearing a covering over their faces (Wayne and the other guy who was not Jeremy). I also noticed that Wayne and Jeremy were sniffling and Wayne sounded congested. I did not ask them to put the masks back on because I put myself in their shoes, . . .

(3) Jeremy approached me and asked me where were my items going to be delivered, and I said Harrisburg, and then he said, how far is that away from here, and I said about two hours. Looking back on this line of questioning now, I do not believe Jeremy's employer's notified him of the details of the job. I say this because immediately after that conversation, Jeremy's demeanor changed entirely; a full 360. I told Jeremy before he went out the front door not to leave without me because I wanted to follow them or I wanted them to follow me. .

(4) Several minutes later, I got a call from David, and he said, Jeremy, is refusing to deliver your items. We are trying to find another driver who can take the truck to Harrisburg. I said, ""Why? I don't understand. What was the reason he gave you? David said Jeremy told him that he asked me to sign some documents. I then said, and I signed them. David then said, Jeremy said you had an issue with a security guard that works there, so I guess someone who works there told him that. I was like, what? So what does that have to do with him delivering my stuff? I then told David that nothing Jeremy said amounts to a valid reason why Jeremy is refusing to deliver my stuff. David said he would contact Jeremy's manager and call me back and he would also try to find someone else to deliver my items. 

I started to feel very uneasy by all of this, so I rushed out of the apartment, returned my keys to the office staff, and went outside to see if the truck with my entire life was still outside. I did not see it. 

(5) David called me back and said that Jeremy's supervisor said that Jeremy is going to deliver my stuff. I expressed to David that I do not believe there was ever a reason that he should have declined to deliver my stuff because nothing happened between us. David did not like my response and said, ""You should be happy that he is going to deliver your stuff. You don't need to say anything else. Just say thank you and be happy about it."" I was like, Woah! So I told Dave, I should be happy that you all have agreed to pack my items and deliver them and that you are actually going to deliver them after saying a few moments ago that you were not going to deliver them AFTER driving off with all of my items in your truck? David's response was, you did not pay us though. We have not received anything from you. And I said, and you have not delivered anything, which was our agreement! I immediately said David, like I told Jeremy earlier, this conversation is going in a negative direction and I do not wish to argue with anyone. David responded, ""Your problem is you talk too much."" I said, David, if you did not want to hear me talk at all, you could have sent me a text message stating Jeremy changed his mind and agreed to deliver my items . . .

6)Thirty minutes later,I receive another text from David that said, I got another text saying Jeremy is not delivering your items; we do not know if he will or won't and we are trying to find someone else; his supervisor is contacting him now; ill let you know as soon as possible. I replied, ""Okay. This is extremely unprofessional, and David said, ""AGREED YES VERY MUCH."" I then sent a message to David pleading with Jeremy to deliver my items. I literally begged him and I even told him to tell Jeremy that I would send him 100.00 directly if he would just deliver my items. NO CUSTOMER OF ANY COMPANY SHOULD EVER HAVE TO PLEAD WITH THE COMPANY TO PERFORM THEIR END OF THE CONTRACT! I immediately pulled over at some unknown location. I asked David for the address of where the truck was located with my items because I started to feel as though I had been scammed. . .

I was about to call the police to report my items stolen when David texted, ""As I was reading your text, I saw a text from my operations telling me that They are delivering and are on the way.""  

When I arrived at my new address, the moving truck was not there. . . Jeremy and Wayne eventually showed up with my items, and I felt relieved. I decided to stay in my vehicle while they unladed my items to ensure that Jeremy would not feel un feel uncomfortable, or whatever it was that he felt earlier in the day, again, and drive off with the rest of my stuff.

USFKkshRKpSxmY7xWiZvlg,WFXqCsd97UsXcE8K_uQ4_Q,0paFcSaR_aaJbRopdcw1Cg,1.0,2,2,2,"So, gross. My parents read that this place made one of the stl food zines top 10 bbq joints in stl, so we went to try it out last weekend.

All of the sandwich descriptions looked super tasty, and the one with brisket, fried jalapenos, bbq sauce and cheese sounded like my fave, but I'm particular about my brisket, because I usually don't like the sliced kind since a lot of times it's fatty and wet. I normally only order brisket if it is chopped into pieces. So, I asked the counter dude how they cut their brisket, he's like all practically stoned by the way, and dead pan is like we slice it, you can get it thick or thin depends on how you want it. So, after serious debate, I decided to take a chance on the brisket. Dude didn't ask me how I wanted it sliced but it didn't matter anyway.

BRISKET WAS LIKE ACCORDION MEAT. It was so mottled with fat that you could literally pull on it and collapse it like a fking accordian. It was like the side view of those honeycomb blinds. It was like the wall of some intestinal track. And, there was like Fat surrounding the edges. I couldn't eat it at all. 

Normally, my dad would be like just eat it, or point at a piece and say there's nothing wrong with that piece, but this time his look was pure pity, and as I started eating my cheese and fried jalapeno bun sandwich, he gave me a rib and then a chicken wing from his combo platter. 

Oh Joy! I thought, this looks good. But no, neither of them had taste, it was so depressing and gross to be trying to eat something that had ZERO taste. We all agreed on this aspect. The hand cut fries I had were also without seasoning, and tasteless. My mom got the pulled pork sandwich, and I think she fared the best of us all, but only because her pork had an egg on it so it had some sort of flavor. The pulled pork was in good shape, it wasn't wet or greasy or fatty.

On to the dining room..it looked like it hasn't been updated since the last defunct business left. The carpet was completely worn and gross and it was so hot in there. Normally I would try to understand a small business that had a shitty a/c, but i mean, put some shades over the windows or invest in a new unit or something because sitting in a hot restaurant is one thing but sitting in a hot muggy SMOKEHOUSE with a shit ton of MEAT COOKING is another.

As we were leaving my mother also commented on the state of my brisket saying she wouldn't have eaten it either. And it's obvs that this dude was using the crappiest quality brisket he could find, at least on this day. He should be ashamed to sell that shit. I mean I guess I could have asked to see a sample of their brisket before I ordered it, but who wants to be that person? Next time, I don't care where I am, I'm asking before I order!",2011-07-29 20:33:47
hJEw3inlVrea8oJD3rDIMg,yL-aGpv0oe_ldhia3uQptg,aWYn5TveRUk2LuOExDnt1A,2.0,0,0,0,"Went to Martines after a great experience there last summer, but found it to be a very poor experience this time.  The drink menu was OK, but the drinks were weak and a bit overpriced.  Barely got a buzz from two rounds.  Had what was described as little neck clams appetizer for $18 and was told it was a big portion.  What came were about 16 cockle sized clams about 1/4"" in size, more than $1 per miniscule clams which were not little necks.  Little necks are 2"" in size.  Not only was this a rip off, but bordered on an intentional misnaming.  It came in a tasty broth, but no bread to dunk.  we had to ask for bread which came too late and was hot on the outside but frozen in the middle, clearly not fresh.  When I told the waiter, he didn't seem to care, did not apologize and did not offer to replace the bread.  We also had the beet hummus lite bite with carrots, which came with two tiny carrots in a small bowl of hummus.  Again, no bread and we needed to ask for a couple more carrots to dip.  I ordered the pork loin entree.  I have made pork loin at home and had it in restaurants many times.  Its the filet mignon of pork, tender, lean and about 2-3"" inches in diameter unless pounded thin and made bigger.  I don't know what they brought to my table, but it wasn't pork loin.  What came to the table was a 1"" diameter by 4"" log of some meat completely wrapped in grizzle. Pork Loin doesn't have grizzle. It was tough, chewy and rare in the middle, not what you want to see with pork. I sent it back after one bite, feeling both my clams app and my pork loin entree were improperly misleadingly named.  I went with the Scallops instead, same as my partner.  The staff did not apologize for the horrible pork, the manager did not come by to ask what was wrong, they offered no accomodation for the poor quality or the wait while my partners entree got cold waiting for my second choice.  I had excellent scallops the night before at H2Ocean in Morristown (see that 4/5 star review).  No comparison with what I got here.  The 4 (not 5) scallops were smaller, tougher and had a fishy odor indicating they were not fresh.  They were swimming in an oddly flavored sauce with a spoonful of jasmine rice and undercooked flavorless Romanesco, barely decent.  The dessert menu had four unappealing really boring choices which we skipped.  Don't know if the place has a different chef in the off season, but the experience versus this past summer could not have been more stark and not in a good way.  Food and Service gets one star.  The charming dining room with river view gets one more, but pick someplace else when in New Hope.",2019-12-09 02:01:24
U42BpvXjJsxNEZTsDkcZhg,GYt3N67dTDXsMB9jSbk14Q,UcdjvDYQg6B1Ht9FEqNKnw,2.0,1,0,0,"I tried here. I really, really tried to give them a chance but alas, this review HAS to be updated.

Little Caesars of Roslyn, you continue to disappointed me.

I'll start with what is positive: price and location. I can walk to your store. The $5 hot and ready is SUPER convenient for me to grab on my way to a girlfriend's house. That is, when you actually have them. Twice now, there were no pizzas ""hot and ready"".

I will tell you what your number one problem is and what is holding this business back: Employees.

Every time I go in there, I see a new face. I understand that the average age may be teenager and I don't disparage that. Hey, I washed dishes at that age too. However, these children are not properly trained; especially on the phone. They have zero communication skills.

For example, I called yesterday (12/04/16) around noon for a pizza. I gave the girl my order and the conversation had come to a natural close. I said ""Ok, thank you"". *CLICK* She hung up. No ""thank you, goodbye, thanks for calling, etc"". Nothing. Just a click. It was rude. Even the Greeks that don't speak perfect English across the street say ""thank you, goodbye"". It is just common courtesy (or at least it should be).

The other indecent I had was a few months ago. I kept calling and calling to place an order and all I got was a busy signal. This went on for over 15 minutes so I figured I'll just walk over there. I tell the girl behind the counter that I've been trying to call and their line is busy. There was no one else in the store. She tells me ""Uh...we are busy"". I was immediately suspicious. ""Really?"" I ask. ""Is this your number?"" I show the number of the pizzeria saved in my phone. She confirms it. I dial and put it on speakerphone. Busy signal. ""Why isn't your landline ringing right now?"" I ask. She just smiles and asks if I would like to order. 

This tells me either they took the phone off the hook or someone else working (not working?) there was using the phone out of my sight. I didn't see anyone else but the girl behind the counter.

There was a ""Help Wanted"" sign up yesterday when I went to pick up my pizza. I agree that this place does need some serious staffing help or else they aren't going to make it. This is a shame because once you get past the lousy employees, and wait, the pizza itself is good. But with the volume of turnover, the hassle with ordering, and inconsistent pizza-ready times I'm going to have to go somewhere else in the neighborhood. Luckily in my previous review, I listed how many there are in the neighborhood so we will not be without pizza.

Good luck, L.C. on getting some new, quality, staff members in there.",2016-12-05 20:47:58
FlJv5wWkujxytMRxxL9X_Q,cufhYFdyrUAt4SWe-m0grQ,88fozCHR1kA0WmUQS21TCg,4.0,10,5,9,"There's a lot of potential at Rosemary.* It's less than two months old so that factors in to my rating. I think once it gets its sea legs it will be a measure of cocktail bars/lounges that come after it.

Let's start off with the good: Nashville's cocktail/lounge renaissance continues unabated. If you enjoy a good, well-made drink, Nashville is serving you up exactly what you want. Surprising that East End didn't have an option like Rosemary before now. I arrived to ponder at least four cocktails I wanted to try. Not being able to make a decision, I asked my server and she suggested the Avalon. Gin has long been my least favored major spirit. But, these days, it seems that I am spending my drinking time and money on gin-based cocktails. So it went with the Avalon and I don't regret a thing. It's a visually appealing combination of gin, midori, lime, and cucumber. Served in a sort of glass I didn't recognize, the light green hue of the drink added to my enjoyment. The midori cut the herbal quality of the gin to make for a light (but potent) summer cocktail that got the party started. The cucumber and lime added to the drink's freshness and seasonable sensibility. Adding to the interesting cocktail menu, the space inspires conversations, pictures, hanging out, and dancing. The playlist was decidedly 70s. Purposeful, not kitschy. Since it's mid-summer in the Mid-State, mugginess and mosquitoes are a thing, so I stayed inside. There are, about, six distinct spaces to post up so choose wisely. I'm not one for soft, fabric seating in dark bars (give me metal and wood any day), so I opted out of the den area (my favorite visually) and sat in the open cocktail table area. I dug it and the place wasn't so crowded that it was hard to hear my drinking buddy.

Now, the growing pains. The music that I enjoyed so much was loud, uncomfortably so. I wasn't here for/on the dance party weekend. I was here on a Monday. At 6. Keep the volume down. If things are this loud this early, no way the space is able to maintain a vibe that makes sense with the design. The drink I had was lovely but when I tried to get another, I waited 20 minutes and gave up. Again, this was a Monday at 6. The bar wasn't packed and there were two people behind it. I am slow to call them bartenders as I witnessed them play on their phones and giggle with each other rather than attend to the customers. 20 minutes for a drink in a slow bar (within view of said bar) doesn't make sense. I considered getting a bite to eat but the advertised food menu wasn't available. Because I am such a fan of the qualities mentioned earlier, I am willing to let the headaches mentioned here go. But these issues need to be addressed. There's a lot of potential at Rosemary. I am expecting the bar to live up to it.

I didnt look at the clothing, because we went in there for furniture and kitchenware.  The dishes were a good price, I got some pretty stoneware bowls in great condition for $1.99/ea, but the furniture was ridiculous.  I saw stuff that had chips out of the finish and terrible wear on it with paint and nailpolish splashes on it for like $24.99.  One of the coffee tables wasnt even solid wood and it had dog chews all over the legs and also had nailpolish and paint on it (almost all the furniture did) and they wanted $29.99 for it!  it wasnt even a nice piece of furniture to begin with!  We tried to bargain about another table.  It was an IKEA table, and it hate the style of table name under it on a sticker, and we looked it up on our phones and the ""new"" version of the same table, which was much nicer, was $19.99..... Goodwill wanted $9.99 for it! It wasnt ""new"", had some wear and the corners were rounded from use, and it was the older version of it, at least 5 years old.  We pointed that out and they wouldnt give us a discount.  said, ""thats why its half price"".  We got it anyway because we needed SOMETHING and, well, it was only $10 lol. Plus it was the ONLY thing without nailpolish on it!  but yeah... their prices were ridiculous!  

oh... and dont forget to check out the extremely F'd up leather couch with cracks galore and DUCK TAPE all over the middle cushion!  for freakin $50! Its something you would see on CL for FREE and STILL no one would want it! they are INSANE!

PS... for the idiots b****hing about there not being a fitting room, many MANY thrift stores dont.  I dont know about SB, but about 80% of the thrift stores in the midwest dont have them.  especially the smaller ones like this one.  They cant afford to police the shop lifters like reals stores do.  and since there are ssssoooo many ways to stick clothing under things and into your purse, etc, because there is no one monitoring the cameras in the back, its just easier.  Some of the stores, such as good will and Salvation army, at least the ones in the midwest, will allow returns with the original tag ON it, and the receipt, for instore credit w/in 3 days. 

so... thats my two cents!",2014-03-14 18:58:38
wwdNb2uqrZLNVC5S3tYVhg,Gg3awu97Zb42u1xYPA27gw,2oFeY8vJy_ujQPbmmnKSdw,1.0,13,0,0,"Our cat fell very sick and we took her to AMC and had an appointment with Dr. Trosclair today. I was supremely dissatisfied with Dr. Trosclair - she is abrasive, harsh, and rude, and also UNHELPFUL - I paid for an exam and left with almost no extra information. She was basically reprimanding me for not buying bloodwork and other diagnostic tests. Dr Trosclair, when I come into your office, I am paying you for your medical advice, and you can be courteous and patient with me. That's what good customer service is. I am not paying you to sit there and be reprimanded for not buying your products. I really tried to be clear with my questions and present my concerns about my cat, but your responses were very unhelpful because you clearly were only interested in putting our cat through some more diagnostic tests and then having us buy further treatment later down the road. 

For example, our cat had a large, hard, swollen piece of tissue on her leg. I paid to get a physical exam to ask Dr, Trosclair about what that might be. I had to ask Dr. Trosclair several times before she would even feel the cat. She said it was not a lymph node and that the cat did not have an infection. Great. So I asked, 'what could it be'? Her first response was ""you have to get a sample and test it to find out"". I asked ""what are some common explanations that you would expect to run into""? She very quickly rattled off a list of terms that I do not know. In my mind I was thinking OK, great, you gave me a list of medical terms that I know nothing about and nothing about what it means or even what kind of treatment you would need and how that would improve my cat's health. I tried to push her to actually expound a little bit so I could have some useful information, but she was defensive and abrasive. Really just rude. 

It seems like their mission here is to get you started down a road of spending: first on diagnostic tests to just figure out what is going on, and only then can you start to get treatments. And they don't like it when you try to get something useful out of the physical exam, so they berate and reprimand you for not getting diagnostic tests. It is a reasonable expectation to have an idea of some of the possible things a diagnostic test would show, and what the treatment would be for it, BEFORE YOU GET THE TEST. I have NO problem paying for medical care, but I work hard for my money and I am going to make sure it is being used for something useful before I spend it, and I CERTAINLY will not be REPRIMANDED AND PUNISHED for not immediately jumping on the bandwagon and paying for diagnostic tests. 

Dr. Trosclair was unhappy that I was asking questions and trying to get as much knowledge as possible out of the exam. She was practically scary with her abrasiveness. I was extremely unhappy. She was so scary that I have to write my impression here, I was too scared to say anything to her face but I wanted to walk right out of the appointment. Dr. Trosclair was not a helpful doctor AND her customer service was terrible, she made me feel terrible. Probably because she is used to telling EVERYONE nothing but ""get more diagnostic tests"". I asked many clear questions on the kinds of problems that diagnostic tests find and what the treatments are -- NO GOOD ANSWER. Lots of words and names but no REAL information about the state of my cat's health. Getting medical advice should be made as clear and easy as possible for the customer. If you explain why I need something, I will buy it. But I am not going to be reprimanded into buying something WHEN YOU WON'T ASNWER MY QUESTIONS AS TO WHAT THAT WILL LEAD TO. 

Dr. Trosclair, your attitude is terrible, your customer service is repugnant, and your medical advice is nonexistent.

EDIT 12/26/15 - We visited another vet today and the doctor ACTUALLY FELT the cat and immediately said that ""something was very wrong"". She did an ultrasound for $50 and said ""I will spare you the expense of bloodwork and other diagnostic tests because she won't make it"". Thankfully we found someone who could give us that information without leading us through unnecessary hoops.",2015-12-23 04:15:07

Yes that's right, 115 years and counting. That is called winning right there my Yelp family.    

You have got to love a place where you walk in with empty hands, and leave with a box, or boxes of pastries. From cookies, cakes, and specialties like their cannoli. Their cannoli can be filled with mascarpone, ricotta, or even chocolate.  Even their different variations of fruit tarts, and torte will make you crave for more. Isgro's rum infused delights, like a rum brick, rum baba, a pesca alle creme, that just makes you want to howl at the moon. 

My personal favorite is the ever so lovely, seductive pastry with that enticingly beautiful lobster tail shape. What is my obsession? My addiction? My kryptonite? It is an Isgro Sfogliatelle. An euphoric bliss of pleasures rushing to your taste bud with every bite into that flaky pastry. Filled with ricotta cheese with hints of vanilla, and orange to it that will handcuff you. Simply orgasmic with that powdered sugar sprinkled over top like it was a gift from a high power. This will forever be my love.  

What will be the outcome from this adventure of all adventures you ask? Happy faces reacting to the different varieties of deliciousness that Isgro's has to offer. Isgro's you've got us hooked, this is where you separate the fools from the diabetics.

This crew over here at Isgro's Pastries do an amazing job in feeding our addiction,  accommodating to our sweet guilty pleasures.

 Mind you, during the holidays Isgro's has a line when you get there, so please don't be intimidated by it. If you pass on it, you basically made a huge mistake. What is best about this line is as you wait, employees will come out and feed you. You know you need to keep that energy up, and why not with some delicious samples of their pastries. If the weather is a bit nippy, Isgro's has a table set up with piping hot coffee to keep you warm . Not to worry, if you need some of that ""extra octane"" to keep that motivation going.  Isgro's will send out their employees with a tray of generous sized samples of liquor to keep you warm, and in that ""jovial spirit"". They loved my silly ass when I was double fisting  Sambucca, and Amaretto. (You need to be 21+ of course.)

""Isgro, potresti avere altri 100 anni di successo!"" I will translate to my non speaking, or reading Italians out there. ""Isgro, may you have another 100 years of success.""

Part of the reason is because of lackluster/uninspired food, but another is because I don't feel like eating the same shit over and over again. Oh, you guys have calamari? And what's that? It comes with an aioli? How fuckin' fancy! I've never had that before!

With that being said, I'm kind of torn on Triumph and their chain-like ways. First off, we showed up on a Sunday night at  4:55 (note: if you ever see me eating dinner this early, it means that I'm insanely hung over from a night of bad decisions, and I'm technically eating my breakfast; so come over and buy a brother a pick-me-up cocktail). We walked into the restaurant, and were then told by the hostess that it would be a few minutes before they could seat us, because they do not open until five. 

WTF.

Last time I checked I wasn't in line for a Nintendo Wii, nor was I waiting for a general seating concert of Blind Melon, so let me sit the fuck down. Didn't you read the note I just posted on Yelp™? I am fucking hung over. Sit me down at a table and water me while I look over the menu--certainly that will take up the five minutes of ridiculous time that you have me waiting in your foyer trying to bait me into purchasing a TRIUMPH t-shirt. 

Anyway.

So, we finally sit down, and I like what I see--modern, clean space, and a ""moto-motif"" that wasn't nearly as bad as I had been expecting. But then I open the menu and find what I fear may be the biggest sign that St. Louis' dining scene is going in circles.

More and more I see that St. Louis' non-chains are morphing into carbon copies of each other--oh look, there's appetizer A! Oh, and entree B! What? You serve your desserts in pseudo amuse bouche style glasses? How original! 

On the flip side, there were some interesting takes done by Triumph. They had a ""Road Trip"" option on their soups, which was a flight of all three of their soups (though part of me suspects that they did this only because they found the retro-mod serving ware on crazy discount, and wanted an excuse to use them), and they also had an edamame ""hummus"" that wasn't amazing, but was definitely worth trying, if only to see what edamame hummus tastes like.

The Lady Friend had a sandwich, which tasted like it came from Bread Co.; our friend had the Beef Medallions, which were good, but I expect at least  that level of goodness for the price (see Revival review), and I had the Fish and Chips, simply because I was curious to know how an Asian-inspired Fish and Chips would go down. Not that great. 

I know this review sounds totally negative, but it's not. It's more of a lamentation on the potential future of the St. Louis dining scene. Overall, Triumph is a very solid restaurant that serves the same stuff as other very solid restaurants here in the Gateway City, and to make up for it, tries to get creative with interesting apps and entrees, that don't really impress. The best thing about Triumph is their menu pricing--on nearly every entree they have a regular and a smaller serving option. So, you can get exactly the amount of food that you want, for exactly the amount of money that you want to spend (i.e. Beef Medallions for $20+ or $15). 

Is Triumph amazing? No. Would I come back? Certainly. Do I hate their hostess? 

Fuck yes I do.",2008-12-05 07:01:11

I wait all year for my one week of vacation time and the only place I want to spend it is at The Peppermill.  I save up all year long and then shop the internet for the lowest prices on my favorite Tuscany Suite.  This year I received a promo from The Peppermill, plus I am supposed to get a 20% discount on my room because I have a rewards card.  Well that's great but after the discount theses ridiculous charges show up.  If I am paying to stay at a hotel at nearly $130 a night then why do I get charged a resort fee to use the amenities that should come with staying at the hotel and then to pay a tax on top of the resort fee, a resort fee tax. That is BS.

  I had so much respect for this hotel and I just loved staying there.  I would actually cry the night before having to go home.  But the fact that they are taking advantage and gorging themselves on the ridiculous taxes saddens me.  

The staff are outstanding and they were even courteous to my service dog. The food is amazing and the pool, I could just float in it for eternity. 

 What does make me a bit sad is that this July I finally thought I convinced the rest of my family to give The Peppermill a try.  We are going to spread my father's ashes as a family and I thought well let's stay at The Peppermill, Dad always wanted to try it. And I made reservations at Bimini's for a special dinner to sweeten the deal.  But unfortunately they are going to stay at GSR because it is cheaper (and nasty in my opinion) and because of the big jump in fees I might have to join them. 

 I will try to get some more work in before my trip so that it can be affordable but it isn't looking good.  They could charge whatever for a room that isn't the problem. 

The problem is that you can't go overboard on charging ridiculous fees for things that should be included with the price of the room.  And you can't offer a discount if you only negate it with a build up of ridiculous fees.  This July might be the last time I stay there but if the prices keep going up and nothing to show why they are rising, just stupid fees, then I will have to try another hotel.",2019-06-29 02:25:00
oy0hrJFUAL9CyVcGx9D_Mg,eQB6K65YTZdEa8uxsF83VQ,9IGKHnZLa_bvzR2qS7xpuQ,1.0,2,2,0,"Well today the incompetence, moronic, and inept Old Chicago staff finally lit my fuse to the point I'll never visit any of their establishments ever again. So let me give you the 411.

Old Chicago has from time to time mini-beer tours celebrating various special occasions (Oktoberfest, Cinco De Mayo, etc.) where a patron (who has a World Beer Tour card) consumes usually eight to ten beers (only can get credit for four beers per visit) to complete the mini-beer tour and receive a commemorative T-shirt.  My problem is on my last two visits and one prior to these I didn't received credit for the four beers I drank for the mini-beer tour (did get World Tour credit).  

Two weeks ago during my last visit I asked the waitress why I didn't get credit and she went and asked the manager.  She returned and said she didn't enter them in correctly and the manager told her she would have to wait 24 hours to reenter them to get the mini-beer tour credit and assured me she would correct the problem as she worked the next day and kept my receipt to reenter them.

Well I went today had a late lunch and another four beers paid and got my receipt which showed that the previous beers were not entered for the mini-beer tour as well as these additional four.  I asked her why I once again I didn't get credit.  She replied, ""I didn't know you were taking part in it.""  With a face of utter surprise I replied that you saw my World Beer tour card so why wouldn't you think I wouldn't be partaking in it?  She said she was sorry and would gladly go and immediately correct her shortcoming as well as the other waitress' mistake.  

That's when it hit me.  

They are all clueless at this frickin establishment!  If this waitress indicted she could rectify the problem for all the eight beers then either the manger doesn't know his own system and told the other waitress incorrectly or the manger just wanted to jip me again out of credit and have me return again and consume additional beers or this waitress didn't know what she could or couldn't do.  Plus I was peeved the other waitress didn't do as she promised she would. I personally think the management trains their staff specifically to be this brainless and obtuse.

I told her not to bother as I wouldn't be returning to this establishment or any other Old Chicago establishments in the future.  Not that the loss of my $50 per visit will kill their bottom-line or send them into bankruptcy but when friends again ask me to catch a game there or attend a birthday party I'll tell them not no but HELL no!  Hopefully that will sway them to pick a different venue.  Don't get me wrong, great pizza and beer and I drive 40 minutes from my home in Sahuarita area to get there which says a lot but once you get on my bad side you stay there.

It will also, have our already established BBQ restaurants adjusting their game. WildSmoke has entered the competitive STL BBQ market with an outstanding menu, customer service and atmosphere. My drive from the city to west county was totally worth every mile. 

Today, I was greeted by a cheerful hostess who thanked me for coming in on their first day and explained the flow of their business. I then went over to the counter to order, I already knew I wanted Burnt Ends, so all I needed to select were my sides. My BE's""s came with two regular sides and I selected Root Beer Baked Beans and on the recommendation of the cashier I choose Sweet Potato Gratin. Being extra hungry (no breakfast) and being a fan of Mac-n-Cheese, I ordered a Premium side of Jacked Up Mac-n-Cheese. 

Once your order is taken, you're given one of those numbered pagers that sit down restaurants give you when waiting for a table. You then select a table or booth and wait for your food. After a short wait, a friendly runner/server brought my food to the table. My device didn't even vibrate, he just knew where I was. 

All the sides are made in house and you taste the love and creativity that went in to each of them. The Root Beer is made in house and when it is added to their baked beans, it gives a sweet twisted taste that makes these baked beans taste better then any that I have had at any other BBQ restaurant or backyard BBQ. 

The Sweet Potato Gratin, deserves its very own star on a culinary walk of fame. The thinly sliced sweet potatoes were layered and topped with a crispy brown sugar top. This side was spicy enough to give my throat a little tingly burn and to have a few beads of sweat appear along my hairline and forehead. I want this recipe! I want it at Thanksgiving and every BBQ meal I enjoy. They were so good, I wonder if I need to create a list for Sweet Potatoes here on Yelp. 

Their Jacked Up Mac-n-Cheese, is made with traditional small elbow macaroni. It is evenly covered in a rich creamy cheese sauce. I normally like it to be backed, but the flavor is good enough, that I didn't mind. 

Finally, I have found a BBQ that knows how to serve burnt ends. They serve them as burnt ends, as full pieces of meat. I am so tired of some BBQ joints trying to be creative and dicing and slicing their BE's. They sauce and toss their ends, with just enough sauce to coat them lightly. As I enjoyed the tender pieces of meat, I had no need to add additional sauce. 

I had the opportunity to meet and chat with the owners. I was also impressed with the hustle and bustle of the staff in making sure the opening day went smooth. I was so impressed with this lunch, I taking a friend back tonight for dinner. I gotta try the ribs, corn on the cob, onion rings, red neck potato salad and of course the Bourbon pecan pie.",2014-01-28 19:13:32

The other reviews are correct that it gets pretty noisy and rowdy here on the weekend.  On Friday evening I was at the pool and had noticed the poolboy was rather irritable and slurring his speech and a bit later there was some sort of altercation where I heard the poolboy yelling loudly as he was taken away in handcuffs by a police officer and the hotel manager.  Super classy.  On Saturday, the pool became a Spring break resort with loud thumping music, drunkenness and crowds.  During the week the pool had been relaxing and pleasant, but that was no more.  I found out they open the pool to locals who can buy a pool pass so most people at the pool were not actually hotel guests and hotel guests get no priority access so things get quite crowded and rowdy on weekends with people coming there to party.  My room was overlooking the pool which was quite lovely during the week, but on the weekend it was awful.  I was here for business for a conference in the building and I had to wake up very early on Saturday to give a presentation and wanted to take a short nap mid-afternoon but that was impossible with all the noise coming from the pool.  It did quiet down some in the evening but there was still a good amount of noise.  I feel so bad for the people who are right over the bar where the music was playing, as I was across on the other side of the pool and it was still so loud from there, plus all the drunken people screaming (there was some sort of large birthday party down there at the time).  And I wanted to use the pool that day for a relaxing swim but that was impossible with the drunken partying crowds. The hotel also seemed quite a bit busier on the weekend in general and I had to wait long periods of time (5-10 min) to get the elevator to come and you couldn't take the stairs to the lobby since the stairwell doors are locked (see my earlier post).  The room service also was not great and they never even replaced the old bar of soap after 4 days so by the final day it was mushy and gross.  And sometimes they didn't clean the room until mid afternoon. I saw the cleaning lady fixing up my room once when she came late and I didn't want to have to ask her to come later and risk not having it cleaned at all.  When she replaced the towels, instead of bringing in towels folded neatly, she brought in wrinkled towels loosely hung over her arm that I'm not even sure were clean as they looked like towels might look after you hang them up to dry on a hook after a shower. And the cleaning process was quite minimal with the living room area not even cleaned at all.  And the bed sheets were not changed at all in the 4 nights I was here. The bed only had a sheet and a very thin blanket with no thicker blanket or comforter. On the weekend I had a difficult time calling the hotel operator to make a request as no one would answer the phone for a long time.  There seem to be a lot of families with young children here given the pool and it's not really great for a business traveler despite the conference meeting rooms on site. And the extra blanket I requested from room service was covered in old blood stains :( (see photos).",2017-07-30 01:53:21
e4dhP5skCAzb76WUMD96qg,I0ezkVvCcBnavJf2soWHjA,tcvNBC65Gsa4cH1_gyucpQ,5.0,8,6,6,"""Oooh yeah, Noord, we've been meaning to go."" It seems like that's what everyone says as we launch into our rambling about this Dutch spot. This has been happening pretty frequently lately, because all we do is talk about food, first of all, and secondly, dinner at Noord was an excellent experience all around, leaving us with plenty o' food-talk fodder. We had been in the same meaning-to-try boat. We finally went, what the hell were we waiting for? You too. Get on it.

For our wedding anniversary we brilliantly decided to head Noord. Had to early-bird it on the reservation this night. In the 5:30ish dusk of an unseasonably warm Fall Wednesday, we had the cozy little restaurant all to ourselves, and a breezy, open-windowed seat facing out to the streets. You know that Passyunk's good for the people-watching, most times. 

At 5:30, I will report, you may enjoy watching people hurrying home from work, or carrying yoga mats, or my favorites, the line of people waiting for the bus. You know you always got some characters in the bus. 

Service couldn't have been sweeter, starting with the fact that our server complimented us on both bottles of wine that toted along with us. ""Oooh excellent, what's the occasion?"" He asked.

Guess who loves to feel like a wine genius. Guess who will easily let the smallest of kudos go to her head and call herself a, ""wine genius?"" Exactly. Appeal to my vanity, world. Do it.

He drew us a heart with a number 15 in it, to mark said occasion, on the white paper topping the white table cloth. Awwww. Dude. Ole Kathleen thought that was the cutest.

The food, right? Get to the food. We loved it. And here, I loathe to admit, as a self-proclaimed insufferable food-know-it-all, I just don't know that much about Dutch cookin. If pressed, I'd most likely bark guesses at you like,"" Fish?! Cream?! Dill?"" Oh yeah, it's all that, but much more. Our dinner left us all curious enough to wanna become Netherlands' foods expert geniuses.

The bread to start the meal was a jaggedly ripped hunk of a semolina loaf, grilled til the bread's torn innard shards were charred little peaks. Served with a tasty little compound butter, we unabashedly accepted more, when offered, to soak and savor every scrap and bit of sauce. Dope bread for all the dipping.

Speaking of sauces, that escargot starter concoction was unlike any other escargot preparation that I've I've ever had. And I do enjoy some snails as a fan of the cooking of the French and as a connoisseur of witch's brews. 

We couldn't decide between a couple of the appetizers and our server steered us toward the sautéed escargot. Good directions there, sooo happy bout that. The sauce, I'm saying: herby, roasted cherry tomatoes, garlic confit and juicy mandarin orange slices came together in the most magical way. Then it was studded with these perfect little toasty cubes of sweet and buttery brioche croutons. 

During the Noord ravings that may or may not culminate with me grabbing you by the collar, screaming, ""Try it!!! Go!!!"" we are constantly on about this dish and that uniquely delicious sauce combination. One o the tops.

The cheese and pickle board was also a winner. Especially dug the goat cheese custard most, amid all the board's  goodness of some well aged gouda- the kind that had those little butterscotchy crystal bits, a melange of housemade pickled vegetables (including one pickled green tomato that somehow amazingly tasted, to me, like tomato-textured salami), cold potato, and grainy mustard. 

For our main courses we both ordered one of the night's seasonal specials; still Summery-meets-early-Autumnal. Sauteed Atlantic Pollock was topped with beautiful blue crab, grilled corn, sour cream, and spikes of the sweet and sour flavors of segments if pickled peach. Killlaaaaaaahhhh... Such a good dish there. 

Beyond capacity be damned, we're gonna have dessert on our anniversary. Of course. Oh and I Love an almond flavored cake. So that had to happen. That dense but soft, crumbly, buttery almond cake topped with a dollop of brandied cream was absolutely, totally wonderful. I'll say that it hit the damn spot despite the fact that there was nary a spot left to fill after our feasting. You can always find a spot. With a glutton's gumption, you can.

So I wasn't lying. I can go on and on about this cozy Dutch BYOB. A much shorter story would read: We loved the great cookin and excellent service at Noord and if you've been meaning to go, you should. Don't sleep.

Z27qDe8OTGvPFAtYMpwnuw,TwhJuUJ84N9DZdPsKeybfg,SJM5bSgqdmAPSiuB4MWNIw,5.0,0,0,0,"I love La V - Vietnamese Fusion! My favorite item that I get most of the time is the Beef Pho. (Everybody here probably already knows that it is pronounced ""Fuh"".) The Beef Pho is a delicious soup that is simmered for 12 hours. It consists of clear beef broth, rice noodles, white onion, cilantro, and slices of beef. On the side, you get a plate of crispy, fresh Culantro (not cilantro but a flat herb that is best described as having more bite and pepper than the often mistaken cilantro), Thai basil (sharp and biting), Jalapeño, bean sprouts (fresh and crunchy), and lime wedge. You are supposed to add them a little at a time as you go, but first tasting the broth by itself. It also comes with hoisin sauce, (a sweet dark sauce made of soybeans), and Sriracha which is nice and spicy. Believe it or not, they even have other sauces that are hotter. Be careful with them. I needed a lot of extra napkins to mop up the profuse sweating. (I still loved it though.)

I cheat and eat the noodles like spaghetti, using a fork and spoon to twirl them. This way I avoid the slurping and splattering onto my sports coat, tie or shirt. However, it's ok, even preferred, that you stick your face into the bowl while slurping. You get a hit of those aromatics while avoiding a messy splatter. The Sliced Beef & Meatballs Pho is the same, but has meatballs added to the sliced beef. It's also super tasty.

(An interesting little tidbit is that pho is served primarily at breakfast time in Vietnam.)

My other favorite at LaV is the Seafood Pho. If I remember correctly, it has shrimp, clams, mussels, squid, and scallops. Maybe Jason Saal can help me out here.

Another must-try item if you've never had it is the Boba Tea - tea with condensed milk, and sugar that tastes delicious. The distinctive characteristic of Boba Tea is the tapioca balls which have a consistency like gummy candy balls. It's fun to suck them through the extra wide straw and chew them up.

The Spicy ""Hue"" Style Noodle Soup is super delicious!

For me, this has the perfect amount of spiciness; measured by taste / heat in the mouth, and by how much I sweat. If I sweat on the top of my head, (which I did), it is perfect. If I profusely sweat from every pore in my body, then it is too spicy. This Spicy ""Hue"" Style Noodle Soup has the perfect amount of spice. However, if this scares you, the good news is that you can request it less spicy.

(One of my pet peeves when I go to an ethnic restaurant and request spicy or extra spicy and then get the food as mild as can be probably because they assume the white boy doesn't know what he is talking about - that's as annoying as being cut off while driving.)

LaV, thankfully delivers perfectly on fiery. Just be careful with some of optional hot sauces.

Besides the nice red-hot sting, this soup is so wonderful because you get several different flavors and textures. Flavors - vegetal, meaty, salty, tart, tangy, piquant, and savory. Textures - hard, soft, chewy, meaty, crunchy, gummy, crispy.

The ingredients that deliver this scrumptious party-in-your-mouth are: cylindrical rice noodles (they are hollow and fill up with the tasty broth), beef flank, pork surimi, and pork knuckles. The knuckles are on the bone, but fall right off.

They are served in a red pepper and lemongrass beef broth topped with white & green onions, and accompanied with a fresh veggie plate which is similar to what you get with the other pho dishes.

The veg plate leaves out the Jalapeño since the soup is pretty darn spicy to begin with, and adds a type of cabbage / slaw mixture in lieu of bean sprouts. You also get the lime wedge and Thai basil that normally comes with the pho accompaniment.

As I said in my last review regarding the fresh veggies and herbs; You are supposed to add them a little at a time as you go, but first tasting the broth by itself.

Here's some real interesting info I found out while talking to Jason Saal, the GM - LaV is now open until 3am on weekends, and they are now serving brunch on the weekends too. I saw the brunch menu, and I wanted to try everything! So, remember to request the new Spicy Noodle Soup, and add LaV to your brunch and late-night / early-morning drunk munchies rotation.",2015-12-31 20:38:28

I had my first experience with Triumph Grill on NYE at 6:30 pm for dinner. I had a reservation and my bf and I were seated quickly upon arriving. The place wasn't busy at all, yet in the dining area where we were seated there were three other tables of diners, and only one waitress. She was stretched but was definitely eager in helping the other tables ahead of ours. We waited for some time to be greeted, but she did stop while passing by to say that she would be right with us. After a while longer, she came back and took our drink orders. After having received our drinks for a few minutes, she passed our table and asked ""how is everything?"" That's strange in that ""everything"" was literally just cocktails. We understood that she was wrapping things up with two of the other tables (giving checks and such) so we let it go. 

After a while longer, she came back to take our food orders. I ordered the cajun shrimp pasta and the boo ordered a sirloin with NO ONIONS. She wrote it down and rushed off. A different staff member brought our dishes, and what was there sitting on top of the boo's steak? FRIED ONIONS. We weren't impressed at all. After a few minutes, our waitress came back with an almost exact replica of his steak, saying ""you were brought the wrong steak. this is your steak,"" and swapped it out. Mind you, THE ONIONS WERE STILL THERE! He stopped her and expressed his concern about the steak. She INTERRUPTED him saying ""that's just for decoration, there are other onions that weren't put on your steak."" WTF?! No apology, blaming decoration, and interrupting with an irritated tone of voice. No bueno.

After she ran off, the table of two sitting close to us asked us if our food was cold? We replied that it wasn't cold. They told us that their soups and entrees were served to them cold. I explained that we were not impressed with our service so far, and they stated that they've had good experiences here in the past which is why they decided to come here for NYE but that their experience this evening was awful. When the waitress returned to their table, I heard the women complain about the temperature of their food. The waitress INTERRUPTED them saying ""we have a cold kitchen. We don't have a hot kitchen."" ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?! Like really?! I've never heard of a restaurant give that excuse for why the food is coming out cold! Never. Ever.

Although my pasta was good, I've received the same quality for about $8-$10 less elsewhere. The boo thought his steak was okay and finished it. I should also mention that I had the Paris Manhattan cocktail, and it was good. Our bill for two entrees and two cocktails came to $77. I inquired if the two chocolate desserts (cake and flourless torte) came with ice cream, and was told ""i can add ice cream for an additional charge."" I passed. I wasn't in the mood to be served by that woman any longer that night, or to give this restaurant any more of my time or money for the evening, so we left, somewhat disatissfied and turned off. 

Based on this experience, I probably won't return here, as it was nothing really to write home about. Cool ambiance (dim lighting), cool motorcycle museums (from looking through closed glass doors), interesting selection of music although a bit out of place with the atmosphere of the restaurant (""Baby Got Back"" was played among other random assortment of 80s/90s pop and hip-hop music), but not enough to overcome average/decent food and terrible service.",2018-01-02 17:16:06
LuOfzO0cDSJRlPJhfmYgKQ,Q8ehc_ZPMZxQXeomyqGIhw,xYEeA5rK8nQxSbETixCQbQ,4.0,14,0,0,"Really, in my back yard?

Craig Laban (Philly Inquirers master restaurant reviewer) gives Hans three bells (Excellent) out of four. For those that follow Craig, we know the rarity of a three bell restaurant as most of his reviews are one or two bells. So this obviously caught my attention.

Hands down, Hans Dynasty is the absolute BOMB for Chinese cuisine. Simply awesome.

I ordered take out only, so I cannot comment on the table service. Although, the dining room was completely full and smiles could be seen everywhere. The staff seemed friendly and were attentive while I was waiting for my order to be completed, quickly welcoming new guests as they walked through the door.

The decor is modern Chinese and definitely reflects the origin of the menu. Visually, it is a mix of complimentary textures and colors, Large slate tile married with natural woods in warm red tones. The space is small, and fills quickly, but the noise level didn't seem too bad.  In the back of the dinning area was a finishing station, mirrored with a large frosted window behind which the primary kitchen. Every so often you see bursts of flame through the frosted glass as dishes are prepared. Way cool.

The dining area is very clean, even after a full year in business.

So here's what we got witha brief review for each.

Sweet and sour cucumbers - Crisp, bright with a nice sweetness and hint of spice. Each diagonally cut wedge was nearly the same size demonstrating real attention to detail and of course, some serious knife skills.

Dumplings with chili oil - Savory and salty (not too salty though). These are the best dumplings I have ever tasted. The sesame seeds added a nice texture to the soft dumpling.

Dan Dan Noodles - I have to say, this was not a hit for me. The flavor was obvious and the spice well-balanced. The noodles have a licorice overtone. Thats not a criticism, it just doesn't favor my palette. I can see why people like this dish.

Chicken with broccoli - Again, this was a huge winner with myself and my girlfriend. Nice sweetness and a really unique flavor. I NEVER order chicken, but I would order this again.

Double cooked pork - This was my favorite dish on this visit. The pork was tender and juicy, thinly sliced in a wonderful sauce. It did have a little kick, but like all other ""spicy"" dishes, it was never overpowering.

Pork lo mein - This is my usual favorite noodle. Again, this may sound repetitive, but the best lo mein I've ever had. Tons of flavor, perfectly cooked. Period.

In all of our food, the freshness of the ingredients shined through. The flavors were well balanced against the spicy ingredients. In addition, each dish was unique. Nothing had a similar taste or flavor. 

My girlfriend and I could not stop eating. Even after three plate fulls, mixed with eat menu item, we were ready for more. We settled on saving the rest for lunch the next day. The portions are pretty good for the price. All the food listed cost a total of $54. A great value.

Look, this is a must stop. Wether you go to the Philly, Exton or Royersford locations, just go.

QwggaJEpj2QnNf7yfaH3jA,nGDVBx7hOgN59jGV_eSsgg,YUtYV7iXqiUX19gFBiy9SQ,1.0,7,0,0,"Went here for lunch today with my hubby to be. We were short on time, as he's only allowed an hour for lunch. We picked a table, attempted to flag a waitress down, and finally one came.  She gave us our menus, asked for our drink order, then immediately asked what we wanted. We asked for a couple minutes to look at the menu, so she walked away, took another table's drink order, then immediately came back. We asked for a couple more minutes, and had to flag her down three times for her to come back. Strike 1.

We ordered the $7 crawfish pie; I stuck my fork in expecting there to be filling. There was filling....at the very bottom. The top was a pocket of air. Strike 2. But, I let that slide, as it was his favorite place for roast beef poboys. 

We waited for our lunch until he couldn't wait anymore. He asked the waitress if we could pay and just have our food boxed so we could leave. She leaves his card at the table and goes to the kitchen to ""check our order"" (mind you, it had been over 45 minutes). He has to get back to work, so he left WITHOUT HAVING LUNCH TO EAT and I waited for her to come back. She finally comes back, 5 minutes later, food in hand, smiling. I told her he had to leave to go to work, and asked nicely for boxes. The smile left her face and she not-so-gently put the plates on the table and walked away for boxes.

She comes back to the table with 2 small boxes, grabs MY sandwich off of my plate with her bare hands and throws it in a box. Umm, excuse me? I can handle my own food! Then she says one won't be enough for his and storms off to get another. I quickly grabbed his sandwich, and stuffed it in the box. She comes back, I told her I was able to fit it, so she grabs a fist full of pickles from his plate, holds them up to me and says, ""Do you want the pickles, too?"" Not now that you've put your hands all over them!! Strike 3! I'm sure that's a health code violation or two right there!

She took my card to run the bill, $30 for a crawfish pie, half shrimp poboy, and a whole roast beef poboy. Oh, and his diet coke, I had water (which I'm sure they would have charged for if they could have). $30! It took another 10 minutes to get the card back, and she sent another waitress to bring it to me. Strikes 4 and 5.

I called when I got home to speak with a manager. The girl who answered made me repeat everything to her twice. She told me the manager/owner wasn't in. On a Friday. At lunchtime. Yeah, okay. Finally, the kitchen manager called. He was nice-ish about it, apologized a couple of times, but said he would have to have the dining room manager call me. Well, here it is, after 10 pm and no call back. Strike 6.

Definitely NOT going back, and would highly discourage anyone else from going. Unless, that is, you're okay with your food being touched and picked up by a waitress who deals with dirty cash and dirty dishes all day.

For 3 days I called, emailed more than one person and facebook'ed messaged seeking the answer to one simple question (the order of the nights line up). Not one person within the facility answered, replied or contacted me. I called the number on their website multiple times within a 3 day period during the hours that the website says they are open. The voice message on the phone also says you can call the box office within one hour of show times to speak to someone, which I did call, again numerous times and every time it went straight to voicemail. I emailed the address on the site and I also emailed the person in charge of bottle service, and neither cared to reply. And through all of this I went to their facebook page and asked the question and again, no reply.

Does management not have phones, or email or check their fb page? or do they simple don't give a f**k about answering a customers question about the nights concert? The website did not make it clear exactly who was going to be headlining the show and all I wanted to know was the order of the line up. My question was asked repeatedly for 3 days, up to within one hour after doors opened, with ZERO response. 

I just need to know what is the actual process in ignoring a paying customer when they have a question? Do they read the emails and messages and say ""I don't care about answering this paying customer's question""...or do they just delete emails and messages without reading them? does no one answer the phones?..do they just let it ring and ring? Is the phone even in the facility?

Not that my problem is their problem but I was under a time constraint that night and my night was being scheduled around one of the performers which is the only act I was interested in seeing. Being they did not reply, I missed half the show of the one I wanted to see because no one cared to reply to me in 3 days.....3 DAYS!!....AFTER REPEATEDLY ASKING/CONTACTING!

As a last resort I even called the organization selling the tickets (not the republic box office..as stated above, i called and only got voicemail after voicemail)  and while I did actually speak to a human being, even they could not answer the question and told me to contact the venue.

And since I'm bashing the management I may as well point out for their mixed drinks (for anything requiring pineapple anyway) they use that disgusting fountain/syrup artificial mixture for their mixed drinks. They should use pineapple out the can..the real stuff..not that fake mixture b.s.",2017-05-08 15:10:23

After posting a Yelp review on icon I got a call from the office saying she wanted to talk to me but I knew it was just going to ask me to take it down. So when I dropped off my rent check, the manager came out and said was the Yelp review directed to her and I said it was to the whole management working in the office. And about the apartment being dirty when we moved in, she said I should have said something ( which I have before and nothing happened ) and she can help but what is there to help, you're still going to charge me for everything. 

I didn't even mention in the last post how my car was towed in December despite me having a parking spot that I pay $150 each month for. So many people have parked their spot outside the garage and blocked me and have made me late to work but nothing happened. I wrote so many notes on people's cars to move and told the office people keep parking there but they didn't do anything. So one morning I left my car out for maybe 15 min and she towed my car. When I asked if she towed it she said no and then I asked the tow guy out side the apartments and he said she called. She lied. Apparently I was blocking ""employee parking"" but there was so sign that said that or in our lease. Where I parked was were the electric car goes but it wasn't there for days. I had to pay $360 to get my car back and she only gave me $150 off!! I pay my own rent and everything and I don't have money just to blow on being towed because I blocked her spot. 

Again I have lived here for 3 years and this past year has been my worst year living here because of the new manager. She says has made the place better but she hasn't. My roommates have had so many issues with her as well. Example being her mom has a handicap sign so she parked in the designated handicap spot and she left a note on the car saying next time it will be towed because it was only for residents and guest. Yet she was a guest and she spends thousands of dollars on her daughters rent. Another incident happened with a key and her mom wanted the corporates number but she wouldn't give it. She was so disrespectful

The view we had was amazing!! BUT with a management like her I wouldn't never live here again. I loved the location and it being furnished but it's not worth it because how much you pay, the management there sucks",2016-07-19 18:36:43

I had managed to reserve a table for the Sunday Prix Fixe dinner and it did not disappoint.  I remembered last time that I had wanted to try the stuffed pigs foot and was told to just call ahead and ask about it.  I did and we, mostly I (more on that), were able to get the last one.

From the entrance to the seating everything was what one would expect from a top restaurant.  Courteous, attentive service with warm smiles and friendly expressions.

The soup this evening was a chilled watermelon and beet gazpacho with roasted baby golden beets and pickled watermelon rind.  My only critique of this dish, which is also my only critique of the entire meal, was that the watermelon rind was too large to obtain and eat with the small demitasse spoon and cup.  Otherwise, the flavors were fresh, vibrant and helped to awaken our senses to the oncoming meal.

During the course of dinner our server took great liberty in refilling our wine glasses even though there was a point when I should have put my hand over my glass and waived my napkin.

The guinea hen and foie gras galantine and seared foie gras was the second course for us.  The galantine, served room temperature, had a great rustic appeal that matched the style of cooking established by Chef Pierre.  The foie gras was amazing as always.  Those of us fortunate enough to have experienced the foie gras from Bibou in the past know that the quality and care taken to the liver is perfect.

The next item was our reserved item.  The foie gras stuffed pig's foot, crisped up and served over a bed of braised lentils.  Easily one of the best items of the night.  The crispy pig skin and gelatinous'y innards complemented with the soft foie gras were simply perfection when accompanied by the lentils.  I could eat that dish every day, although it may have dire health implications later on.

For entrees, I opted for the oil poached arctic char with corn, broccoli and a corn-uni emulsion.  The sauce, poured table side, was the perfect balance of sweet and salty complementing the char and the sauteed farro.  My wife went with the petite filet that was accompanied by a potato gratin and a marvelous sauce medoc ($5 supplement).

Chef Ron graciously complimented our meal with the assorted cheeses of the evening, some of which were left on the plate as my stomach was reaching near excess.

For dessert, we shared the chocolate pot de creme and floating island with homemade almond pralines.  At this point, my wife had to finish the sweets as I had reached capacity, but she informed me with every bite that they were all exceptionally tasty.",2014-11-17 22:58:10
gLpRD1kTJiDv18HVZ7CIAg,CZL4uF5XQqHmWAkC4wZFUA,deNOTM_X7PF8W3E2cKWXyw,4.0,1,0,2,"As soon as I heard about Juniper Cafe in Strathearn (which isn't a corner of the city that I visit all that often) I was excited to check them out. They've got a reputation of being one of the most kid-friendly restaurants around and as someone with a small child, this is appealing to me. In fact, their entire vibe felt pretty familiar and reminded me of Lazy Daisy's Café in Toronto, a favourite place of mine that is also incredibly family-friendly. Juniper was also given the ""Don't Skip the Dishes Here"" designation in CBC Edmonton's Best Restaurants 2019 (which means that the plates are too pretty to order-in). I visited on a Sunday morning and was ready to brunch! (What else are Sundays for?)

The space is a lot larger than I expected it to be and it screams homey comfort. You can tell that many of the large tables are meant to be used communally, which is a surefire way to bring people together. The restaurant promotes the idea of community in many ways and I especially loved the small (sectioned off) play area for kids at the back of the room. They've got glowing hanging stars, a rustic country-fresh atmosphere, and a very cool (and large) gallery wall featuring all sorts of interesting objects and art. In ""normal times"" you'll even find blankets hanging from the chairs for added coziness. The friendly staff seated us quickly and I found myself contemplating a brunch cocktail, as one does. It had to be the Sunday Caesar (A savoury combination of Raw Peppercorn gin, hot sauce, olive juice, clamato and worcestershire - $12.00) being that it was Sunday, after all. I always love a caesar but the ingredient that piqued my interest in this one was the olive juice. You'll often see pickle juice in a caesar but practically never olive juice! I loved this idea because I love olives. Unfortunately, I found that the beverage wasn't anything too exciting overall and I've certainly had better caesars in my day. This one seemed kind of watered down and lacked the punchy flavours that the hot sauce and olive juice had promised. I did enjoy the skewer, however, adorned with a pickled jalapeno and a green olive.

Moving on to the food, I love everything that Juniper strives to promote; Fresh, seasonal, homemade, and using organic and local products whenever possible. They even have a chalkboard that lists all of the local producers that they use and I noted many familiar names. The breakfast and brunch menus are extensive, with tons to choose from. Right at the very top of the page is a suggestion: ""Start your brunch with..."" I was not about to say ""no"" to a Warm Scone (With honey/lavender butter and berry compote - $4.50). If this board isn't the most lovely thing, I don't know what is. We were offered two different types of scones to choose from and selected the blueberry and rosemary flavour. I absolutely loved everything about this little experience. The scone itself was delightfully warm, pillowy soft on the inside, with a nice caramelized crunch on the outside. I loved the way that the rosemary came through, with the herbaceousness playing with the sweet berries. I especially loved the compound butter with honey and lavender mixed in. The tart and sweet compote was wonderful as well. I would order this every time.

The rest of the menu is filled with every breakfast comfort food that you know and love. They feature bennies and waffles at Juniper but of course you'll also find bowls and big breakfasts and even huevos rancheros. But if there's one thing that they're famous for, it's the Juniper's Handheld Bennie (Our signature sandwich with roasted potatoes, it's a masterpiece built on a Portuguese water bun, a perfectly poached egg, arugula, your choice of bacon, spicy pulled pork or roasted vegetables, topped with housemade hollandaise and either chipotle or lemon-garlic aioli - $17.00) and I had to try it for myself. I really enjoyed seeing a whole new take on the ever-popular eggs benedict and thought that they took this brunch classic in a really interesting direction. I chose to have mine made with bacon because Juniper uses Irvings Farm Fresh bacon - which I am certain is the best bacon in the whole world. I also selected the chipotle aioli for a little bit of a kick. I liked that they're using a Portuguese bun, which has a thick, crispy crust that makes it perfect for saucy sandwiches. The egg was indeed perfectly poached and oozed a golden yolk that I continued to dip my sandwich into. The bacon was absolutely ideal, of course, but not just because it's Irvings - it was cooked to my exact liking as well (and I didn't even have to ask). Extra crispy! The smokiness from the bacon and the aioli was a perfect match. This sandwich is definitely messy but that added to the overall experience which was a delight. The flavours were great and this is certainly a banner menu item that has been well thought out and executed.
The roasted potatoes were decently nice as well, cooked to the right tenderness and lightly se",2020-11-17 18:18:27
XCemuLWGfSJzP6DbYHLYIg,ZuZoDTOWb2MTjgD-UirS0Q,lX1nMfMRK7zfOZBLMzCKdw,1.0,1,0,0,"I live in New Brunswick New jersey, however because of business,  I often to travel to Warrington, PA.   January I took My Certified New 2011 Kia optima  which I purchased with 20,000 miles was serviced for an oil change at this jiff lub,  I was due and did not want to be over the well due oil change to much longer. 
 The screw was friendly I, must say, the service manager explained to me that I needed to add synthetic oil because the car had a GDI engine which stands for gas direct injection,  I would also need a cabin filter, the manager showed me the old filter compared to the new filter, I agreed, the filter was not as white as the new one and had them do what was best for the vehicle. 
 I had been noticing drips of oil was in the drive way, however though it was just from visitors and  last night while driving to PA  from NJ, when taking off from a light I could slightly hear clicking noises however with the windows were  up it made it appear that it may have been a car/truck driving beside me, the sound got louder and I pull off the high way right away, the first thing I did was check the oil, the dip stick had a burn strike,  I couldn't really see it well and when I put it in front of the head light and swipe the dip stick (3) times to see there was no oil I couldn't understand why, I understand I drove a lot and is almost do for another oil change but to just run out?
 I spotted an Auto zone across the high way in a shopping plaza, I bought 3 things of oil which was 5w30 thinking the clicking would get better, and it did a little.   I drove about 45 to 55 mph with no noise, never any oil lights on my dash for about the next 12 miles and park it until morning.  Jiffy Lube is only 1.8 miles from my business which is why I choose to go here before heading back Jersey.  
I took the car back to Jiffy lube at 10 am before they got busy and customers were there, I did not want to hurt this jiffy lube reputation and have them lose business if someone over heard the issues I was having.  I was meet at my car door like I was the day i took the car in back in January and the same friendly members.
I explained what was wrong with my vehicle and provided my receipt to the manger, he stated that he would take it in and have a look, they discover that the oil drain plug had was night tighten and sealer was not on or around oil drain pan drew also stated that my oil filter was was not screwed in properly, now I'm not to happy but keeping my cool. 
the girl at the front desk, (Not the manager)  had come out to explain what was done to my car, she stated that all my fluids had been topped off,  the oil was over full and the would drain some and had more of the 5W20 because I had added 5w30 and that could have harmed the car because of the velocity in oil types (wow) now I'm getting pissed.
I explain that I only added oil because it was bone dry, and I put oil in the car so it would have oil and would not kill my engine, she stated well we added more and everything is fine however its still making the noise, I asked her to explain to me what was going to happen because this is clearly there mistake, she stated that she would have the GM manager contact me.
I want to be very clear about this, I bought this vehicle for piece of mind, meaning I have a 10,000/100,000 mile power-train  warranty that would cover such major components like an engine, however I do know that warranties do not cover thing others have destroyed so it was never about getting someone to correct another mistake, it s clear whom made this mistake and should be responsible.
I took my vehicle, to the nearest Kia dealership which is 6 miles away, was told it was the engine due to oil and my require a whole new engine,  I can not explain how that made me feel, only having the car for 7 months.
I contacted Corporate and explain to them what the issue was and what I had done about it along with everything that was done when i took the car back to the Jiffy lube,she provided me with a claim # and stated that a district manager would contact me regarding the claim.
I received a call an hour or so later from the district manager whom also attempted to explain to me about oil types and because a dip stick does not have oil on it does not make it empty and that I should have contacted jiffy lube at the time of break down, (are you kidding me) really 730 pm contact jiffy lube.  
Its funny how somethings are clear, cut and dry and someone still tries to pull the wool over your eyes as a customers, I call them crooks, hustlers, ect...and thats just how I feel, Like I've been robbed and I'm picking up the pieces on my own.
A engine cost thousands of dollars and now I'm sitting waiting to hear back from the dealer and the District manager whom stated that he would call back in 30 minutes and its been over an hour.
All of this for 104.00 oil change that should have cost 38.00, but I let them sale me and I've learned a big lesson.",2014-03-11 18:07:26

We arrived our first night and decided to get something to eat nearby since it was late. We walked over to Ole Saint and noticed it wasn't busy . First mistake. I gave this restaurant two stars because the food wasn't too terrible.. well, it wasn't the worst that I have ever had. We had a waitress named Whitney or Whitley. Not quite sure, I would have been more certain about her name if she had actually looked at us while introducing herself. She stared across the room so much, I wasn't even sure she was talking to us. I wanted a glass of wine so I asked for a wine list. She said they had one. Instead of hunting one down for me, she decided to take it upon herself to tell me what wines they offered. Which is fine but if you can't pronounce the variety of wines, then excuse yourself and get me a list. I just ordered a Cabernet to move things along. I also requested waters for us. She comes back, with no water, and takes our order. I ordered a medium cooked hamburger and my boyfriend ordered wings. She decided to memorize our order, which should have been done easily. Right? No. She came back by our table to ask if I had said ""well done"" for my hamburger temperature. I corrected her and yet, I got a well done hamburger. Never got the waters we asked for and she never came to check on us. She finally came to our table after we were finished and asked how we enjoyed our food. At this point, I'm done with the terrible service, I didn't even reply and simply asked for our check. We hand her a credit card to run and she comes back over to literally toss the check presenter on the table with no pen to write with. No manners and no apologies. My boyfriend had to go wander off to another table to get a pen from another check presenter left on a table. As being a waitress myself and knowing tips are what we live off of is her only saving grace she had with us tipping her. Wasn't a good tip but there was still one. I would not return to eat here on our next trip. Someone needs to retrain her before she takes another table.",2018-05-10 23:05:47
FPPyKc4wEeObSbmLto9MJA,Khe-fzQpJ0xPlPwFckBjHA,7Iv-6B0EH-yVo5o_VnykWw,4.0,7,2,4,"When the National D Day Museum opened in 2000, I was there at the opening ceremony. Touring the museum, I thought it was so nice and such a fitting tribute to the Normandy Invasion. A nice and different addition to the New Orleans tourism scene. I again visited a couple of years later when the Pacific wing was opened which added to an already nice experience.

A week ago my opportunity to visit again the new National World War 2 Museum (as it is now called) presented itself. Understanding the museum has now expanded to 5 buildings I decided to pay $6 extra for the second day ticket in case I needed it. I also bought the submarine Tang: Final Mission experience and the Beyond All Boundaries film. I arrived at 9:05 a.m. after parking my car in the adjacent museum garage. First thing I noticed was all of the construction going on outside. Since I bought my tickets online, I went straight to the will call window to pick them up and avoided the line that had already formed at the regular ticket windows. Be sure you buy your tickets online. During the day the regular ticket window line got to be very long. The will call line was always short. You will save a lot of time buying online and picking them up at will call.

The first thing you do after you get your ticket is to board a train for an imaginary trip through time that is really nothing more than a solicitation to also purchase the Dog Tag Experience. If you aren't interested in getting that, you can skip this and head directly to the exhibits. 

The construction going on is to expand this museum even further. However, I think it also adds to confusion. I had left Building 1 thinking I had seen everything going to Building 2 when I realized that I missed the original D Day part of the museum so I went back to Building 1 to go through it. I think this is a mistake that a lot of people could make.

Building 2 is primarily for the Beyond All Boundaries movie, gift shop and dining opportunities. Honestly the movie was a slight disappointment to me. It has a bevy of celebrities doing voice overs and there are nice special effects but for some reason I expected more. It isn't a movie but a montage of events that occurred during the war with special effects. I gave it a 3 but no more. Fortunately it is only $5 to attend and takes up almost an entire hour. You have to reserve which show to attend when you buy the ticket just as you have to for the Tang: Final Mission. Building 3 contains the European Theater of Operations (ETO) against Germany on one floor and the Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO) against Japan on the other. You will spend a lot of time here. 

Building 4 is mostly about aviation with full size aircraft suspended from the ceiling that include a B-17 called My Gal Sal. There are 4 levels to this building which lets you get very close to the suspended aircraft hanging from the ceiling including actually looking down on some of them. This building also houses the Tang: Final Mission which costs an additional $5 and is an inter active recreation of the sinking of the submarine where you participate at different battle stations. While at your battle station you watch the battle overhead from the conning tower's perspective. I gave this attraction a 3 also. Building 5 consists of the rebuild of PT 305, a motor torpedo boat from the war. This tour is free but only given on certain days. I went on it and found it was worthwhile. The boat is scheduled to be finished and moved out in January 2017 and put in the water. I don't know what Building 5 will be used for after that.

I finished going through the museum in one day. This included the Tang and the Boundaries movie. I had time for lunch and the PT Boat tour so I didn't need to use the second day ticket however it was a full day. I enjoyed the museum as it is very impressive and all age groups will like it. I would give 5 stars but for the construction. Unless you have to go now, I would probably recommend to wait another year or so for the construction to finish. Besides that the construction will bring more exhibits to see.",2016-08-19 21:16:23

Deceptive trade practices are an understatement.  The owner Carl is obnoxious and verbally abusive once the contract is signed, especially, when you call him on his deceit.   His daughter the finance administrator also is rude and indignant.   The audacity is the picture of Jesus one wall of the office. The sales man Jack is straight out obtuse. My next review will have the pictures of the tactics used to hide the extensive damage/problems with the car I bought which was simply fragrant disregard for my life and the lives of my children. Their idea of safety check is getting it to pass SMOG.  And I am fairly confident that the car only passed because of the battery reset, because 2 days after I signed the contract and drove it, the engine light came on.    I bought a 2017 vehicle that was supposed to have manufacture warranty still available as it only had 35,000 miles.  I was told was abandoned by owner for financial reasons. Within 3 weeks after purchase, I had to have it put in the shop because the car was unsafe to drive. It had been in a collision (not disclosed) and there was damage that effected the car's safe ability to drive on the road.  When I called the sales rep to advise of the numerous problems with the car, he simply said to me ""I told you that car salesman lie and you could trust anyone, even me""  When I spoke to the owner, he told me that I could trade it in somewhere. Or I could pay for all the parts to fix it (3800.00) and he would have is mechanic work on it...wouldn't that have been the way the car should have been sold in the first place, you know with the safety check on the car?  And would you, after finding all the hidden problems, trust the mechanic he has?   

Well if you have been swindled by NEVADA TOWING you don't have to just take it.  

Nevada's deceptive trade practices are helpful, but are generally limited to prosecuting deception after it occurs.  For information on local swindles, and or to report a person or a local business engaging in deceptive business practices, contact a state consumer protection office. Along with in-state resources, federal organizations like www.consumeraction.gov, and nationwide nonprofits like the Better Business Bureau at (www.bbb.org) and www.fraud.org can assist you with consumer fraud complaints, from filling out the complaints online to finding the appropriate local, state, and federal agencies with which to file a complaint.",2019-08-26 23:11:40

Upon arrival, the restaurant opens to a chandelier-topped minimalistic bar area and an open seating area decorated with modern accents. Overall, the interior is bright and welcoming. It took several minutes before anyone greeted us despite the eye contact we made amongst the staff. Eventually, a waitress approached us and asked us to wait for her as she arranged the tables to accommodate a party of five.   

After being seated for 10 minutes, a waitress stopped by our table to ask if anyone has taken our drink orders yet. After answering with no, a soft-spoken gentleman arrived to take care of that. In regards to the menu, there was a fabulous array of vegan and vegetarian offerings available such as the avocado rolls, crispy tofu salad, and fried brussels sprouts. Moreover, the non-diary option of almond milk for the Thai tea and coffee were offered as an alternative to the usual half-and-half cream.

For the appetizers, we ordered the avocado rolls and Tom Yum to share. We specifically noted to the waiter that we were going to share the bowl (3-6 people) amongst all of us. The food runner was unaware of this request as she brought the bowl out and promptly left. We tried to get the waiter's attention on a number of occasions, unfortunately, his attention was engrossed to the floor. Afterwards, we tried to get ahold of the other waitress on the floor but she blatantly ignored us despite our attempts. In the end, the food runner arrived with the entrees. We explained to her that we did not want the Tom Yum anymore because the soup has gone cold--the food runner's tone of voice, attitude, and behavior in apologizing to us was underwhelming. After being given our bill for the dinner, excluding that item from the balance, the server did not give an apology for the Tom Yum soup.
 
I ordered the Chiang Mai Noodle (Khao Soi)--a famous Northern Thai curry noodle dish with yellow curry, steam egg noodle, pickled mustard, red onion, fried shallot, cilantro, and crunchy noodle. My food was mediocre at best. Overall, everyone in our party believed that the food was subpar and did not possess the flavors of authentic Thai cuisine.  

Originally, we were planning to try their desserts, however as we were so disappointed with the execution of the entire dinner we declined. 

Ultimately, the service was appalling--in fact, there was no service whatsoever and the food was not up to standard. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone. This is unfortunate because this restaurant has so much potential.",2018-05-08 23:58:55

I keep trying new Indian places wherever I go, but none ever comes close to the quality and taste at Priyaa. I have turned more friends on to this restaurant than I can count on two hands, and it's no suprise they keep coming back on their own. The buffet is amazing for trying something new, and I always appreciate the chat with Ganesh asking how life in Chicago has been since the last time he saw me.

 For about 6 years now I've been coming for dinner as well and  I order the same combination of things whenever I go, soliciting chuckles from the sweet and patient servers Divya and Pavana. I get the Thali dinner which comes with a main dish, rice, two pooris, papadam, sambar, dahl, raita and gulab jamun. I substitute the sambar and dahl for mattar paneer and bhindi masala, and I substitute the goolab for fruit salad. 
I order an order of naan, and if friends are with me, we'll get the onion pakora as an appetizer. 

Just typing all this out makes me wish I were hopping in the car right now to head back down to my hometown St. Louis to have dinner. Thank goodness I'll be coming home this weekend! Priyaa is always my first stop when I come back to St. Louis, whether I'm flying or driving. If I'm flying, it's ten minutes from the airport, so I hop on over on the way to my house about 30 minutes west of the restaurant. If I'm driving, it's just off the highway on my way back from Chicago. 

Even if Priyaa weren't ""on the way"" to my house in St. Louis, I'd drive out of the way to eat there. I've traveled from California to Italy to Scotland to Mexico and then some, and Priyaa is still my favorite restaurant in the world. Despite it's humble establishment on Dorsett and Mckelvey, the food here is consistently extraordinary, making it the perfect place for catching up with old friends, skipped high school lunch periods, family dinners, and even a peaceful meal alone.


A wonderfully family-run place with the best Indian food I think I'll ever have, Priyaa is the first place I think of when I come home to St. Louis and the first place I miss when I'm gone.",2013-06-01 17:30:58

It was friday night during their yelp eats 2011 promotion so the place was really busy.  Under the conditions, I thought the staff responded very well.  Did we wait to get a table? yes, but not as long as we thought we were going to have to (good expectation settings.)  Did we have to wait a couple of turns to get our drink order in while we waited? Yes, but once it was our turn the bar staff gave us their full dedicated attention.  Did our server have a lot of tables to focus on?  Yes, but our water glasses were still always full and our table was cleared promptly.  I know events like this can put a strain on a staff and it is nice to see this team rise to the occasion.
I had to take one star off of my review because the noise level was so unbearably high that it was difficult to have a conversation at the table.  At first we thought it was just because the place was so busy, but even once the dining room had cleared out a bit (only four tables seated) it was really loud.  I am not sure why the acoustics in the room carry sound the way they do, but I felt I had everyone in the room in my ear; everyone except my date across the table that is.
The drink menu is beer.  A couple of options on draft and then lots of bottles.  There is also some wine on the menu, essentially one of each of the major varietals.  I would have appreciated a little more breadth in the drink options.
As far as food goes: we ordered two items off of the yelp menu and then their Jimmy's BBQ sampler.
The best thing we had was the seafood gumbo, one of three gumbo options in their gumbo sampler.  It had a lighter roux base than the other two gumbos and a very well developed, complex flavor.  The andouille, while present did not overwhelm the other ingredients and the result was something I could have eaten an entire gumbo bowl full of.  My husband and I decided that come fall, we will head back here just to enjoy this!
The duck gumbo was good.  I found the roux to be a little too dark for my liking and the heat from the andouille was very forward in this gumbo.  Even with those quibbles though, I would eat this again, as they did a good job incorporating the duck so that what could have been a very heavy, greasy gumbo was instead quite pleasant.
I wish I could say the same about the vegetable gumbo.  I was by far the worst thing we tasted this night, with flavors fighting against one another.  
We also ordered the hush duckies.  The outside was crisp but we found the inside to be fairly dry, a little like day old cornbread.  I was expecting a little more depth with the bacon and onion, but we found those flavors to be almost non-existent.
The BBQ sampler is a big dish of meat, well worth the 19.99, and was more than enough for the two of us, especially after the appetizers.  We actually brought more than half of it home!  This platter includes ribs, smoked chicken, pulled pork, brisket and a side (we ordered the mashed potatoes which were really, really good.)
Of the different meats, I thought the brisket was the best.  It was fall apart on your fork tender and smoked to perfection.  My least favorite was the pulled pork, which seemed to be very gristly and greasy.  
All in all it was an okay experience.  We will be back for the gumbo once the weather starts to cool down a bit.  But if we want BBQ, we will probably find another option.",2011-07-16 14:13:19

The Don Cesar (the hotel where this restaurant is located) is a beautiful hotel.  My boyfriend and I toured the hotel before we went to dinner.  We were both VERY tempted to ditch our hotel room at the Sirata resort and upgrade to the Don Cesar.  Alas, we used hotwire, so our stay at the Sirata was prepaid.  

After touring the beautiful hotel, we had a drink at the bar while we were waiting for our table.  Both of us ordered mojitos which were wonderful and refreshing.  While drinking at the bar we got to gaze at the huge fish tanks filled with beautiful tropical fish.   The restaurant has apparently been recently remodeled and is lovely.  It is open and inviting.

Once seated at our table, we were greeted by our server Randy, who was amazing.  We ordered a bottle of wine.  There are affordable bottles of wine even though this is more of a fancy pants place.  Then we were served an assortment of bread (including one with olives, a bread made with cheese, and a multi-grain bread) with assorted butters.  After we placed our order, we got an amuse bouche.  An amuse bouche is always such a nice touch.    

Our appetizers arrived first (obviously).  I had the tasting trio.  It was fantastic!  This included beef carpacio, tuna tartare, and a prawn.  I enjoyed the carpacio the most.  This one was so well done with the beef thinly sliced making it almost melt in my mouth.  

After appetizers, we were served sorbet to cleanse our pallets, which is another nice touch.  I had cast iron grilled prawns, and they were fantastic.  The stuff on the side was the best part (although the shrimp itself was really good too).  The side included pureed cauliflower and artichokes.  I don't even like artichokes, but this was an exception.  My boyfriend got the lamb chops and he said that it was the best lamb he has ever had.  It included a lamb confit that was so rich and tasty.

Finally we got to dessert.  I had the smores.  It had home made marshmallow (which are so much better than mass produced marshmallows) and graham cracker.  It was finished at the table with a wonderful, rich chocolate sauce.  

After all this, we got spoiled again with truffles (key lime pie and peanut butter and jelly) with our bill.  Our waiter Randy told us the former head pastry chef for all the Ritz Carltons has retired to Fort Myers and his retirement pastry shop is where these truffles came from.  These were a special part of the meal too.  The peanut butter and jelly truffles excited my nostalgia for PB&J that was a staple when I was a kid.  And the key lime pie was sweet and tart at the same time.  

We got out of there for just under $200.00.  I realize that is a large sum of money, but if you have a special occasion, this is worth a splurge.",2011-07-10 01:22:45

My bff's daughter decided that she wanted to go to Sizzler for her birthday dinner (I would bet that she chose Sizzler for the dessert bar! Lol) anyway, we were a party of 8. We arrived at 6:30pm on a Tuesday evening.  We ordered our meals at the counter and were then seated. 

4 All You Can Eat Salad Bar's
1 steak & salad bar special 

We were at a large table with our friends & the waitress brought out several baskets of the coveted cheese toast.  The toast is probably my favorite thing that Sizzler has. The majority of the slices of toast were perfectly cooked and some were just soggy.  It was strange. We asked for more toast several times, but it never arrived.  

The Salad Bar
The salad bar was so bad that it deserved its own section! Lol.  The lettuces were all soaking wet.  They had 3 different types and each one was wet.  I ended up putting my lettuce on my plate, took it back to my table, and dried it with several napkins.  It was crazy.  I have never had to do this before.  The utensils at the salad bar were a mess! My son found a pair of tongs sitting fully submerged in the nacho cheese.  He fished it out with another pair of tongs and made an employee aware of where the tongs were found.  She simply said, ""Oh, that's where those went"" and then walked away.  She never replaced the nacho cheese.  At that point, my son refused to eat anything else.  He was disgusted by the idea of how many people touched those tongs before they were lost in a sea of nacho cheese.  

The steak & baked potato
It was poorly cooked.  The steak was under seasoned and very fatty.  There were probably only about 5 bites of the steak that were edible.  The baked potato was a hot mess! It was so overcooked that as I put my fork into the potato, the inside turned to a consistently similar to sand! It was disgusting.  

Service
We would have made our server aware of our issues, but she didn't show up very often.  We didn't get refills on our drinks and she never checked in on us once our food came out.  She did however, inform us that they were closing early because the staff earned a pizza and movie night.  They were very motivated to get everyone out of the restaurant so they could have their party. 

I won't be giving Sizzler another try. I spent over $70 to feed my family of 4 and we all ended up having a bowl of cereal once we got home!",2018-08-25 05:46:59

Meanwhile not many people showed up for the reservations they claimed were on the books.  I then witness them seat 4 people ""inside"" who did not have a reservation.  Strike Two: We ordered two of their signature cocktails a Big Guava and a Apple cider old fashioned.  My cocktail was sour and had NO guava flavor in it.  It tasted like lime and rum only and watered down to boot.  My husbands ""Old fashioned"" was nothing like an old fashion and was pretty much straight bourbon.  My husband attempted to order two different wines from the menu ( the only ones offered by the glass) to be met with them not having them but no alternative offered.  Server didn't seem to know the menu well, couldn't offer any other wine suggestions nor know the game of the day and had the excuse I'm new.  Strike Three:  I ordered the lacquered Delmonico medium and my husband ordered the bone in ribeye medium rare.  The food arrived and I was presented a flat iron steak ( which I did not order).  I told them I had ordered the Lacquered Delmonico and they took the flat iron back.  My husband cut into his steak and it was well done.  So his went back as well.  They did put a rush on our corrections but here's where they failed again.  My steak was cooked medium (pink in the middle) but the texture of the meat was VERY tough?  I've never had a Delmonico steak that's tough?  Instead of having a nice sear on it, it had a charred burnt taste.  The lacquer sauce on it couldn't save the burnt taste that overpowered the whole steak nor fix the tough texture.  My husbands ribeye steak came out half raw and half well done and also with a tough texture.  The sides we ordered were ok except for the Bella mushrooms which were so over marinated that they lost their flavor and were like rubber because of it.  We didn't bother complaining because the manager had already comped our steaks while they were being remade because of the screw up with our order.  For the price you'll pay the meat quality is horrible.  We've bought better quality steaks from Sams club.  For a restaurant that has meatery in their name they need to take a look at who they are getting their meat from because the quality is awful and the cooks need to be retrained on how to properly cook/sear a steak.   We will not be back.",2021-02-07 15:37:32

""""""""""""""""""""
To whom it may concern;

My name is (deleted for privacy) I am a 25yr old female.  I went with my best friend and my two 15 year old cousins. I was enjoying my night until I went to the corn field haunt. Let me tell you what happened.... I was first scared by two actors which was fun but one actor started asking me where my boyfriend was, which seemed a little odd but i thought it was just something scary/teasing he was saying. The two actors then left as we kept walking. Probably 10 mins later my group bumped back into the tall actor again (I'll refer to him as ""Joe""  from now on to cut down on confusion). I was messing with the battery on my tobacco vaporizer because it fell out of my pocket and it wasn't turning on. Joe asked if it was a vape and I explained yes it wasn't turning on. Joe asked to see it then saw I have a ""tile"" device taped to my vape. Basically if you press the button on my tile it will ring my cell phone so i can find my phone. Joe starts to ring my phone from my vape trying to be funny. After he does it twice i ask for it back. He says he will give it back if i give him my number.... Then my friend chimed in asking what was going on , I said ""he wont give my vape back"" Joe says ""that's cause she wont give me her number"" . My friend was very shocked by this but we are both really nice so she just went along and said ""what do you mean?"" to Joe. Joe said ""she probably wouldn't want to date a 6'7 black dude"" ... Keep in mind this is all in front of my 15 year old cousins!!! So Joe starts to ""playfully"" walk away with my vape constantly ringing my phone and asking for my number... He does this until he guides us to the exit. Then when he does give me my vape back he asks if I have a tinder... Which is basically an app for people trying to hook up... Then asks if i have any social media he can have... 

So now that you know what happened let me say my two cents. This behavior from a male staff member to someone PAYING to be there is completely unacceptable. I just wanted to enjoy my night with my friends and family. NOT BE OBJECTIFIED. I already deal with unwanted advances in all other situations. But when I'm there PAYING to have fun and be entertained I should not be harassed and have to explain why I'm not dating/wont give out my number. And to top it off in front of my young cousins. It made not only me but my entire group extremely uncomfortable. It ruined my night because as a woman its very frustrating to be objectified when i'm just trying to have fun at a haunted house! And by an employee!! Like where do I get a break and just get to be seen as a person not as a sexual object... 

Honestly the biggest waste of $30 I have ever spent.
""""""""""""""""""""

The worst part is i sent this on a Friday I called them the next day to ask If that email is checked often, the man on the phone said it goes to the managers/owners cell phones.  The man said he would leave a message for them to check their email. I waited until Monday  and sent another email saying this doesn't seem to be a high priority... the email was titled ""sexual harassment by employee/actor"" FINALLY on Tuesday I get an email apologizing from Mindy ... Mindy didn't offer an compensation for the horrible experience... and the email was SENT FROM HER IPHONE! Proving she had access to this email through her phone. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone looking for family friendly fun...",2018-10-27 03:37:47
8n8Bq2r-oa4KBbUpne_k5A,A9cXP_K95FRor1qxuUEu2g,ZamcoxNtToUXvMvwF5Yk2w,2.0,0,0,0,"While my wheelchair journeys through Indiana largely consist of visits to local restaurants, on one particular night I found myself in Plainfield, Indiana with only one truly local restaurant nearby that I already knew was a higher-priced option that didn't make sense since I was on a fundraising event. So, instead of heading for a fast food option I opted for an attempt at a better and healthier meal at Bob Evans. 

Since Bob Evans tends to attract an older customer base, the expected accessible entryway is common among all locations. The layout tends to be friendly to wheelchairs, as well. 

I was seated at a comfortable two-top; the atmosphere was rather loud, but workable. I browsed the menu, which I believe had recently changed, and was surprised that it seemed like the usual ""down home"" options I expect at Bob Evans weren't quite as evident as I'd have expected. They still have some options, but it seems like they've diversified their menu and I didn't really get that sense of ""farm fresh"" that I've usually gotten from Bob Evans.

I opted for an order of fish and chips along with my usual unsweetened iced tea. My server dropped off the food and left rather quickly. It took me a couple minute to realize I needed ketchup, or is it catsup, and I kept trying to catch her eye as she served a couple new tables. As I couldn't find any on available neighboring tables, this caused my dinner to become more warm than hot by the time she returned several minutes later. 

The food? It was pretty close to abysmal. The fish tasted like slightly higher-end frozen fish sticks while the fries were modestly good thinner cut fries. It was definitely not satisfying and made less satisfying by the lack of a refill throughout the entire meal - though, I was offered one ""to go"" when she brought the bill. 

The service was somewhere between non-existent to slow - initially friendly if not particularly hospitable, though once the food was dropped off it was definitely disappointing. This was especially true since I saw other servers checking on customers on a regular basis. 

I'm not a regular diner at any Bob Evans, though I've been to several and can easily say this was on the lower end of the Bob Evans experience. There are far too many options in the area and if I would return to this area there's no question I'd make another choice. 

I'd really hoped for a quality meal after a hard day of wheeling. Instead, I got a disappointing meal and service that made me wonder if my presence mattered. 

In short, I won't be back.",2017-03-25 13:45:23
Ce2Qy6MlPAzgdFvaDfp3AA,4wfkBu9NH24iwQirpfFIKw,MoEZGIWnOfOLR7oEj024hQ,2.0,6,0,0,"I am a fairly new member (3 months) to LA Fitness, I previously belonged to 24 Hr Fitness in another state and the differences in comparing the two are huge. In terms of going and it being fairly clean (I haven't experienced the bathrooms being dirty as other yelpers have commented...just the toilets being wet from the swimmers being disrespectful and not drying off first), machines mostly in working order, there being enough of the machines, an OK variety of classes offered, my opinion is yes this gym has these. What this gym doesn't have in comparison are HUGE workout areas, separate rooms for women's only fitness, towels available for their members at no charge, huge clean bathrooms with showers and separate changing areas, all day and late evening child care, a fantastic Juice Bar/cafe for healthy lunches. I realize the Andorra is just a strip mall space and is only doing what it can with the leased space. 

However this brings me to my biggest complaints about this gym: 

1). The lack of professionalism and friendliness of the staff (particularly the front desk):  I have been brushing it off each time I go, but I am NEVER greeted with a hello, or even someone looking me in the eye. Most times someone will only reach out their hand to scan my card without even looking up from a computer. There's a big Beef Head who works the front desk who is particularly snarly but the real crem de la crem here is a female ( Ops Manager) by the name of Amanda who is just down right mean. I had an encounter with her the other day that left me fuming. She refused to allow my cousin (who was visiting for the Holidays from another state) workout (although I had a free 3 day pass for him) because he had been a member a few years ago. (it was the Eve of Christmas Eve....thank you, Amanda. Merry Christmas to you, too) After speaking with the GM about it, 5 days later nothing has been addressed (the GM told me he can't stand her and gets tons of complaints on her, but he's not her direct supervisor so he can only ""pass along this info"". I understand policy is policy but the way in which I was spoken to by her was appalling. I have literally heard other members and staff talking about how awful this woman is and that she berates her staff and has even brought some of the Kids Care workers to tears. Uh...HELLO??! LA Fitness??! When you have a wicked witch as the FACE of your business when your members walk in the door, and they are able to see and hear her treating other staff like crap you may want to rethink your business strategy. 
 *Also beware: There is NO way to file a complaint on their web page, and the GM has essentially told me he has no idea who or how I should contact someone. But I'll keep searching

2). The Kids Club is closed from 12-4. I'm sorry  but I REFUSE to believe there are not enough parents out there who would KILL to be able to work out at this time of day. REALLY??! Are you trying to save $40 bucks LA Fitness by letting your $10/hr employee only work from 8-12, then have another person come in 4-8??!! Totally lame, and this is a MAJOR disappointment in comparison to other gyms. 

**I have to say that the Kids Club employee Miss Kim is AMAZING!!! My daughter LOVES to come with me to the gym because she knows she will get to see Miss Kim. This woman is truly wonderful with the children~she is so caring, easy-going, knows how to handle all of them will such grace. I'm sure other members reading this who utilize the kids club will attest to her greatness. I hear the other moms complimenting her EVERY time I'm in there about how wonderful she is. 

**I also must compliment Leonard, a personal trainer here at this location. While I've not signed up for his personal training sessions (can't afford them right now), I love to observe how he trains his clients. He's so positive, motivating and clearly pushes them HARD. He really stands out from all the other trainers in that he is ALWAYS engaged with his clients, and devotes his time 100% to them ( I often see other trainers looking completely bored with their clients or talking with other trainers during their clients sessions). 

3). Third biggest complaint is the juice bar: I realize that this is contracted separately so there is no affiliation to LA Fitness, however there is hardly anyone ever actually there to help you and again, the employees are quite rude and unknowledgeable. Also, an employee admitted that all of the juices are made with an artificial sweetner. Great. 

Being from the West Coast, I can truly say the standards of service are VERY different here and it's apparent anywhere there is customer service of some sort involved. However whenever someone is paying a MONTHLY fee to go, they should up their customer service game.",2011-12-28 01:38:07
D1nZ-HJTcAC8lwybdVJqcA,ITaYhgI8Zet4oAeF75JLXg,eWOFiCILPoctkbHv8DqzGw,5.0,0,0,0,"We just had our wedding reception at The Fess Parker in Santa Barbara, outside on the rotunda. We ended up getting both DJ and lighting services through JAS Productions. Our event was black tie and we wanted the DJ and music to fit the classy theme (no chicken dance type stuff and no ""let's get ready to ruuumble"" style ushering.

My wife and I had several conversations with Justin over the phone and emails throughout our engagement, communicating with him our vision for the day and what we wanted and especially what we didn't want.

Justin was really good about asking us questions about the type of music we wanted, what kind of equipment we needed, and just overall vibe of the day. It's incredible how worth it this was to spend all this time talking to him, because he nailed it.

The music was really good and he kept people on the dance floor. He is a really good DJ and not only is he good at finding the right tune to play next, but also the seamless transitions between tracks was stellar.

The behind-the-scenes aspects were also really professional. We had all kinds of ""what if"" questions for him and he gave us a lot of confidence. One of the most professional marks I would give him is when he told us he keeps a spare laptop, mics, and pretty much spares of every other piece of equipment with him at the event. This is really admirable and is something every professional DJ should be doing, but not all do!

The other behind the scenes aspects that we liked was the online portal. There is a special section on their website where you can add and cross off certain songs to be played for the night. This portal was available as soon as we booked him and we had months to think over which songs we would want to add. Also, all the paperwork was handled through this portal, digitally, so that everything was clear (people's names, which song was for which dance, etc.)

The lighting was also pretty good. We paid for extra lighting through Justin because the rotunda is huge and we didn't want to pay for the hotel's astronomical lighting prices. Justin took care of all the lighting out there and it ended up turning out really pretty.
A tip for others- the hotel usually charges some sort of a fee even if you're providing your own lighting through a vendor not associated with the hotel. Well, since Justin's lighting was battery powered, we didn't end up having to pay the hotel anything because nothing was plugged into their power outlets.

Anyway, great DJ all around. Justin ended up being one of our favorite vendors. He was easy to talk to and really went with the flow. I'd recommend him to a friend for not just a wedding but any other big, organized party.",2016-08-16 03:25:58
P8M6Z2ZjyTc-7Ck0CvIgfA,_4GAyLP3qbMF2UNcotPEzg,V56WagY-UGiVTF9PYEIfRg,5.0,8,0,0,"Prestige Lebanese delivers authentic, fresh delicious and affordable Lebanese cuisine that tastes just like it should with a spectacular view.  

Quickly for those who can't read to the end, I am already addicted to the crispy crunchy and delightfully non-greasy felafel appetizer served with a perfectly prepared tahini ($4.95), or as a wrap for the same price..  Add to that home-made red pickled carrots, beats, cabbage and cucumber and you already know that you just got lucky in the middle east department.  Savory, well-textured hummus is served in a deep dish garnished with whole garbanzos and splash of olive oil served with plenty of thin style pita ($4.95).  

Prices for apps are around $5, wraps hover around $6 and the entrees range from $8 to $14.  I could stop here and be perfectly content, but there is much more to explore.

The restaurant looks fantastic.  New owners recently transformed the formerly plain looking room with a HUGE mural of the Roman ruins at Baalbek that covers an entire wall.  The travertine floor and folks lounging with a hooka pipe ($12-14) on the sidewalk add to the illusion that you are actually sitting in an outdoors cafe in Lebanon.  The walls are painted in muted taupe and burgundy that showcase the large stage near the center of the restaurant.  With its modest liquor bar, Prestige Lebanese also puts on all-night weekend parties with famous singers that attracts people from as far as Orlando.

You are still reading, a good thing, because I also can report on the some of the items on their comprehensive menu that I have tried so far.  Each has been good to excellent with no ringers.  Today I was particularly impressed with the kafta wrap ($5.49), a nicely portioned grilled ground beef kabob with the right taste wrapped in a pita with some salad and tahini.  The beef shawarma wrap ($6.49) was deeply marinated and very tasty with a completely different flavor profile compared to the milder flavored but delish shish kabob made with fillet mignon.  
My favorite salad so far is the Prestige salad -- a typical finely chopped salad with tomato, cucumber, green pepper, onion, lemon juice and olive oil. 

I had to order the arabic style coffee which was served with our meal in a decorated copper lidded pot arranged on an elaborate tray with proper cups and saucers.  Needless to say it was also delish.  

There isn't much to criticize.  Service is friendly and attentive.  The proprietor, Rania once lived in Switzerland where she learned the restaurant business from her parents. The restaurant already runs like clockwork with food coming out hot and surprisingly fast.  Keep in mind that its a new establishment, and not a ready-to-franchise concept.  In the meantime, enjoy the food and if you are into the party scene, check out their next event.",2011-09-28 06:19:38
xLzRlP6It_2Gwv6kDQxvew,NyKFSZALO2r987KWjjkLzA,bRQ2eZDWDVo2BDHDH3dF0w,4.0,5,3,3,"After lamenting to my husband that I was going to be presentless on Christmas morning (not entirely his fault, as we recently purchased a scooter and had agreed that would be our joint Xmas pressie this year), he offered to take me over to Borders to see if there were any books that I'd like to find waiting for me under the tree. Instead, I wound up popping into Muse Boutique and I'm so happy I did.

One thing I lament about Nashville is that it's only recently getting away from ""mall culture"" where everyone throngs to Green Hills or the like in order to buy the same old stuff at chain stores. I prefer being able to walk around and pop into boutiques with funky brands that let me show a bit of personal pizazz in my clothing rather than looking like I just stepped out of a Gap catalog. 

I was really pleased with the selection of clothes at Muse Boutique! Lots of very trendy stuff that is perhaps more geared towards clubbing or nights out, but those willing to comb the racks are sure to find a few versatile outfits. Given the rather glam slant of the clothes I expected them to be rather pricey, but I wound up founding everything very affordable and reasonably price... even more so because they were having a 20% off sale! I wound up snagging a really cute cream-colored dress with ruffle sleeves (love!) and leather trim, and a black coat with plenty of snaps and straps which pleases me to no end. Also, as others have mentioned, the shoe selection is pretty awesome with lots of statement footwear that had my shoe fetish kicking into high gear. I refrained from picking up any new footwear but I make no guarantees about my next visit...

The only thing that disappointed me a bit about the clothes was that the sizing definitely runs small (probably because there are a lot of designer brands here), so not everything is going to fit ladies who have curves. Also, the store doesn't offer refunds on any merchandise - just exchanges and store credit, so choose wisely! According to the sales girl I spoke with, they get new stock in up to three times a week so there are plenty of excuses to come back and lots of turnover should you have buyer's remorse... which thankfully I haven't! I'll definitely be back!",2010-12-23 18:22:15

I have been to the one on the Hill and the one in Chesterfield, and I think out of all three I like the one in Chesterfield the best. Although, it's been about 4 years since I went to the one on the Hill, so I don't know for sure. 


I didn't really feel welcome from the moment we walked in the door. It was clear that we needed a reservation, and we did have one, but it was odd to me because so many tables were empty and it was a freakin' Monday night! Our server was cold and detached. He mumbled his name and I can't even remember what it was. 

I ordered a glass of wine and the veal nunzio which is my favorite. It didn't take long to get our food which was a pro, however. The veal wasn't as hot as I'd liked when it arrived, and the cheese was a little too cold for my liking as well. Also it came with brussel sprouts--EW--and I don't remember it coming with that. It didn't say that on the menu and the server didn't mention it or ask if I wanted something else like green beans, which I actually would have eaten! The brussel sprouts smelled like a mixture of an old man and a fart, which made me want to puke. Ew, ew, EW! The veal was otherwise pretty tender and good. It came with fingerling potatoes which weren't too bad. Sean ordered the toasted ravioli which was good although the dipping sauce came a little cold too, which confused me. Does it always come cold because the ravioli are so hot? I don't know. It was weird. But I tried the ravioli and they were good. Sean seemed to enjoy them. 

Our server didn't ask if I wanted more wine until I was done eating which was a bummer. The waters did get filled up pretty quickly though, so kudos to the busgirl. There was a tray sitting in front of us with all of the old dirty dishes from other tables and it kept piling up. Ew. Not professional at all.  They should have moved that to a place where no one in the dining room could see it. 

Overall, the experience was only saved by the food. And even then, my veal dish was $28 or so and I did NOT think it was worth the price. It wasn't even that warm when it showed up and it came with nasty smelling brussel sprouts. Sean's toasted ravioli cost around $10, but it did come with quite a few of them, I think around 11 total, so it wasn't a bad deal. I just think the veal dish is WAY overpriced. For $28 I could probably make double or more of what I had, and omit the nasty veggies and probably would have enjoyed it more. Even if I added crab meat...still cheaper and more portions if I made it myself. 

I don't know if I would bother to go out of my way to go back here. They certainly didn't earn my return business. Like Sean said ""yeah, it's in a casino. I don't feel so bad about putting my feet up because I am sure they've seen way worse!""",2012-09-13 22:58:24

Firstly, going into this was extremely overwhelming. Having a party during a pandemic?! Should I? Could I? Turns out, I could. I am so glad I did. I pulled together a pretty tight guest list to surprise my husband with a little party. Even though the guest list was small, I wanted to ensure folks felt safe. Which is why I had some pretty specific requirements: private venue, outdoors, with activity elements, and somewhere easy to get to for people from Orlando. 

The Getaway provided a perfect check for all my boxes. From there it only got better. Working with Brett was easy, he took my (many) calls and responded to my emails. He helped me set up a pre-order for our large party. The order included their pineapple wings which I would recommend to any wing aficionado, I also ordered the fish dip (My husband and I order fish dip every time it is on a menu, this is one of our mega lame games, I can't explain it.) which I was equally impressed with.  Brett also facilitated day of coordination by filling in the team and ensuring our space was set up and ready to go. (My guy, if you ever read this. You are an angel. Thank you.) 

Now as far as the actual party went? So fun! Wildly fun! The Getaway is an awesome place!!! It's well maintained, super cute, there are sooooo so many activities. We were able to bring our own paddle boards so that folks could jet off in the water for some playtime. There are plenty of hammocks. They provide jenga and cornhole. It was a hostess' dream. AND I didn't even have to fill my guest's drinks, because the awesome service team was totally on top of it. Major kudos to Matt and Aaron for being A team, even in the Florida heat. 

Things to keep in mind if you plan to host an event at The Hammocks at the Getaway:
-There isn't music, so bring speakers or maybe ask if they can set some up? Luckily the live music was loud-ish so we were able to hear it a little bit. But the lack of music was the only hindrance to the vibes. 
-The contactless menu thing was a little rough for the setting. If you're hosting an event I would print out little drink menus to provide your guests with, this way they do not have to scan the codes or waste the server's time asking a bajillion questions.
-Most importantly...bring bug spray. Lots of it. The bugs were out. 

I can't believe it took me having to throw a party for my husband to finally pay a visit to The Getaway. The name is crazy perfect. It was literally like being on a mini getaway. The experience was completely immersive and genuinely so enjoyable. Knowing how incredible it is...I cannot wait to go back.",2020-09-28 20:01:01

Omni Nashville Security is negligent, rude and told us ""these things happen"" when we woke up to a strange man in our room (he was in our room for 25+ minutes while we were sleeping!!) Two police reports have been filed and Omni said they would follow up, but have not. It's a nightmare situation made worse by Omni's lack of urgency, negligence- could not imagine how this situation could be handled worse!

My girlfriend and I woke up to a stranger in a hooded sweatshirt holding his flashlight lit cellphone over my bed at 2:30am. I immediately and intensely told him to leave. After trying to hide in our bathroom and me getting up to plead with him to, ""please, leave,"" he finally complied. We immediately called the Omni security team who took more than 30 min to arrive, and lied twice saying they did not have security cameras that would be helpful to us, leaving the intruder plenty of time to get away. Hotel security also said they could not provide us with the peace of mind of who the hooded man might be, they even suggested it was our fault because our door must have been open. We were told to ""calm down"" and ""these things happen."" 

FURIOUS at the reaction to an unknown man being in our room, we called local police and additionally had an outside security team with our company get involved only to find out that there were indeed security cameras that were extremely helpful, and the man had been in our room for 20+ mins, even answering the door to Omni security who was satisfied with his account that everything in the room was alright without even identifying him, that must have been what woke me up. (Side note: They could have given a description of his face if they would have handled this correctly.) 

Our door was closed, we were waiting for a third roommate to come back so the deadbolt was not on, but this career intruder was roaming the halls turning doorknobs and pushing on doors. Omni later reported to us that the integrity of their automatic locks were not always consistent, yet they did not encourage us to us the deadbolt when checking in, this is irresponsible. Members of the security team reported to management that there was an intruder, but he left before we returned to the hotel... another lie.

Though there were countless valuables to be had, he only took a small sum of cash and one credit card, but had plenty of time to leave his own property throughout the room, even into the far corner (showing he made himself very aquatinted and could have taken whatever he wanted.) This man had other plans and the Omni team not see severity of the situation, lied, and told us to ""calm down."" 

This man was very confident, cool and collected, and even told me he was security. He will do this again and Omni squandered their chance to stop him, because of the personal egos of the staff that responded. 
I will forever feel violated by the stranger in our room, and disrespected by the reaction of the Omni security team, including Chris Morrison, and in disbelief that their guests' safety does not mean more to them. Don't  misread my intentions with sharing this, I am very grateful we are all okay, but want to remind others to be vigilant. Take matters into your own hands and deadbolt your door, and always stand up for yourself when people put you at risk. Omni security needs to do better, you are not safe here.",2019-12-24 21:12:13

UA is a great, big, beautiful university. I encouraged my kid to go there because it offers a full array of schools - medicine, nursing, business, engineering, business etc. which is worth considering because if a student wants to switch major, it's do-able, without having to transfer out.  From the get-go he felt at home there - in fact he went ""off"" other colleges he was considering once he spent a day on the UA campus. The accommodation on campus is varied - some older dorms, some newer ones (the older ones seem a big roomier). The meal plan worked fine for his first year. He finished in four years and lived in a variety of settings - dorm room, mini dorm off campus, frat house, shared house with another student in his final year. There is a lot of choice in and around the college.  I'm not sure if they still offer this but when he attended, if you stayed on over the (hot) summer and took classes they offered them at a reduced rate.  It is definitely a college where your kid will grow and mature - the whole point of college, imo.  Just a word of warning - the Tucson/UA campus police take their duties seriously and have a method to curtail too much wild partying in off campus housing which entails a registry of addresses where there has been a loud party and a red paper front door ""wrap"" that must stay in place for x number of weeks after it is posted which announces a ""no parties/large gatherings"" ban - so if you or your kid thinks living off campus will ensure your hedonistic enjoyment for the academic year - think again. When he graduated in 2010 at the height of the recession (from the Eller School of Business) he had a full time job within six months and today works in the Bay area for a major tech company.  
A huge number of Californian kids go there and I have to say I think the university is superior to many of the Cal State colleges just because of the range of schools, the facilities, the school spirit. Also, be aware that many faculty are retired to Tucson from east coast ivy's and choose the teach a class or two for retirement ""fun"". This is a benefit because their teaching standards are high and the classes can be demanding. I also want to mention the learning support that is available - I think it is in the library area but it is up to the student to seek help. In the end, college is what you make of it but there is something for everyone at U of A.  Downside now is the cost of tuition and board - now estimated to be in the mid 40K for an out of state student. UA has gone up cost wise but is probably on par with hundreds of other colleges now - it's a national disgrace what students and their families are expected to pay and very much tied to the lending institutions who are in bed with the colleges - but that's another subject entirely.....
In a nutshell, a great college for academic choice and for discovering your academic interests.",2016-04-19 00:33:08
_4zn6CN-bvWLGTG7fn7liQ,SEz2uN0jrJTPXH3bM1PFhQ,tyDEseGSr6NIsk7S63uMqA,5.0,0,0,0,"While five stars is slightly generous, giving this place four stars on here would be a disservice. Somehow I always end up starting my reviews complaining about the lack of a half-star option.

Anyway, we arrived for our 6:00pm Saturday reservation very surprised that the place wasn't mobbed, especially after being announced as Eater Philly's Restaurant of the Year. However, with the way the restaurant was organized I think we probably would've been comfortable even if it was full.

You don't want to hear about all of that though. You just want to know about the food.

We opted to take the ""tapas"" approach and order strictly from the ""Small"" and ""Medium"" sections of the menu since none of the large entrees were especially appealing to us in comparison.

Dish 1: Hearth Baked Sourdough - Four huge slices of sourdough ""toasted"" in their wood oven and served with parmesan butter. Nothing revolutionary, but definitely a good start.

Dish 2: Octopus - Octopus cooked perfectly, but the congee wasn't anything to write home about and the hot sauce seemed completely out of place on the dish. The spice was somewhat welcome but the flavor really wasn't.

Dish 3: Sweet Potato - Possibly dish of the night, reminded both of us of Vedge's mastery of non-meat dishes. The combination of flavors was incredibly unfamiliar (one of the main reasons we were drawn to order the dish) but worked beautifully. I was concerned that texture would be an issue with the potato-avocado combo but the char from the grill added some great flavor and texture, plus I believe there were peanuts sprinkled onto the dish which worked surprisingly well and added a very necessary crunch.

Dish 4: Lasagna - Wow. A savory dessert if there ever was one. So perfectly rich. The waiter said that this should probably be in the ""Large"" section of the menu, and I would have to agree. Although we were warned ahead of time, the size of this dish really filled us up, and definitely prevented room for dessert.

Dish 5: Duck Breast - I'm a sucker for duck and bok choi so this was definitely a dish for me. A little heavy on the sauce (although it was avoidable), but the duck was cooked a perfect medium-rare and was definitely a pleasant end to our meal.

Despite the fact that the food was (mostly) amazing, what will probably draw me back here is their interesting cider rotation. I am a pretty avid craft beer drinker, and while their beer list, while small, is actually very good, I found myself wanting to try the interesting European ciders they were serving by the glass. My wife ordered the German cider, which was their sweetest option, and she was very happy with the depth of flavor that's mostly nonexistent in American ciders. I asked for ""the funkiest"" of the three available and was provided with an amazing Spanish cider. Next time, I will definitely opt for the three cider flight.

As many others have said, the food here is definitely pricey in comparison to similar small-plate options in Philly. Worth the price? Yea, probably, but brace yourself if you're more accustomed to a Tria-esque check.",2014-11-23 06:36:10
K97Y4MWhZB_55aoiBB69Dg,lhuRHeXQmhQhH4_Vy_EAsg,2wwhMKlfpOd0dpk_AQdt8w,4.0,1,0,0,"I wish there were different categories for food and the rest of it.  Let's start with the positive.  The food.  What we had was absolutely spectacular.  The veal was so tender and absolutely tasty.  Seasoning was perfect.  My wife had an interesting past dish that was unlike anything I had had before, and was delicious.  It is clear that the pastas are made fresh, much like the breads and everything else.  I kid you not.  If you dressed up the place, trained the staff, etc, these dishes could be served at the much more prestigious next door neighbor.  Prices are fair, and its great food.  

The bad news is the ambiance sucks.  From the beginning, I started thinking that Gordon Ramsey really needs to do kitchen nightmares here.  It's just bad.  Waitresses are dressed too casual.  They're nice and friendly, but when you ask for opinions on dishes, a proper server should be able to discuss.  It would take so little to make the service great.  One real positive on this end (which made me bump to 4 stars) was when we asked about wines and the waitress got us two taste samples.  Nice touch.

Then there are the flat screen tvs.  11 of them by my count.  Not at the bar mind you, but everywhere in the restaurant.  I love ""A History of Violence"" as much as the next cinefile, but do you really want to watch some of those scenes (or Resevoir Dogs, Godfather, etc) while you are trying to eat a romantic dinner.  Thank god the sound was off, but it would have been nice to have had some kind of background music.  

Lastly, the place was pretty slow on a Sunday night, but there were several tables.  Towards the end of the meal, some Jersey Shore juicehead wanna be comes in there and while swearing loudly, starts ordering shots.  He may have been associated with the place as his girlfriend went behind the bar and started mixing things, as he yells at her.  It was unpleasant, and really, should not have happened.  There really needs to be a floor manager to handle these kinds of situations.  But no one said anything.  And this guy (and entorage) was so loud, drunk and obnoxious that it was difficult to enjoy the meal.

This place needs to decide what kind of place it wants to be.  If it wants to be Jersey Shore's version of Razoo, it can do that.  Its a great location, and the staff seems to like that kind of thing.  If it wants to do great food and fine dining, it can do that too.  The food is spectacular.  Really.  But when I eat good food, I want to be able to enjoy it.

Changed my mind...back to 3 stars again.  It needs a makeover and it needs a proper manager.  Gordon Ramsey could make it a 5 star place...and I am being serious.  The food was THAT good.  The rest of it is THAT bad, but would be so easy to fix.  Ahhh screw it, I am generous.  4 stars.",2012-04-23 13:34:47

The staff has always been helpful and friendly, so I've had no issues there. On 7/20/16 I dropped my car off because my engine light had come on, then shut off. I needed to pass emissions and wanted to be sure there would be no issues.

After getting a phone call from Firestone, I was told I needed a new fuel pump and I should have various other work done. I agreed to the fuel pump replacement ($600 + $98 for the use of the computer diagnostics) but wanted to wait on the other issues due to the additional cost.

After picking up my vehicle I decided to look at the Courtesy Check list after going home, which I never do because I trusted them to tell me about what's going on and to take care of it.

They must use some sort of Magic 8 Ball during this ""Courtesy Check"". The first clue was the washer fluid was marked off in the green OK box. My washer fluid was completely empty when I brought it in and wouldn't even squirt.

The oil level box was marked off in the red box with a hand written note that stated ""low 1q"". I couldn't understand why this wouldn't have been mentioned to me during that first phone call. I checked the oil level myself, and it was fine.

The brake fluid box was marked in the yellow box as suggested, and the copper PPM were circled at 30. The brake fluid in my car was flushed about 1,000 miles prior to this visit, and it will be good to go for some time.

I can't help but wonder if I really needed that fuel pump, or was it just the Magic 8 Ball? Have I been spending hundreds of dollars again and again on work I didn't need?

I happen to have all of my invoices dating back since 2009. I guess it's time to look them over.

I don't know a lot about my car, but this has inspired me to learn more. I guess I should be thankful to Firestone for that.

I will never spend money in a Firestone location again, even if I need to push my car past one of your stores to get to another shop that charges more.

*******Update on my 7/21/16 post*******

On 7/22/16 I returned to Firestone at 7950 E Speedway to ask about my previous visit. The Courtesy Check list appeared to have been done by someone that didn't actually look at my car. The staff member I spoke with the first time didn't appear to be working.

I didn't get the name of the new guy I spoke with, but he was friendly. I showed him the invoice from my visit, and told him of the inconsistencies on the list.

I asked new guy why the brake fluid flush was marked as suggested when it was done 1,000 miles ago, he said the copper in the system was 'probably left over from the flush' but the current level was at ""new car"" levels, and was good.

When I pointed out my oil was reportedly ""1 qt low"" on the check list new guy replied ""maybe he checked it in the wrong spot"".

I pointed out the washer fluid was marked as good, when in fact it was completely empty. New guy nodded.

I asked new guy how would I know I really needed a fuel pump if these other items were incorrect. New guy responded ""because he's a master mechanic"".

There you have it folks. Master mechanics know when you need hundreds of dollars in repairs, but don't know how to check the oil or washer fluid.

Our party of four had Saturday night dinner two weeks ago. The interior is casually elegant; sort of a minimalist take on a steakhouse. At least one in our party felt the bare white walls were too spare, giving the eye nothing to rest on. The rest of us were content to rest our eyes on the menu and wine list. ;-)

The acoustics of the place were very comfortable. A fairly constant light hum of ""white noise"" from conversations around the relatively small property, but never enough to distract from the conversation at our own table, and we never had to raise our voices to hear each other.

The service was excellent! Janet was an extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive server. She gave great recommendations for food and wine.

On the whole, the food was very good or better. The chef started us with a complimentary sample of their beef carpaccio -- quite an appreciated surprise by all at the table. It was top notch.

I didn't pay much attention to the bread basket set for us, but two in our party were simply in love with the salted butter that came with it.

Then the two ordered appetizers: braised pork belly w/mustard greens and a wasabi sauce (excellent! our favorite dish of the night), and abalone ""fish and chips"" w/lemon-chile mayo (good, but could have had a little more zing to it).

The four of us then shared three entrees: local halibut (good, but nothing special), grilled prawns w/crab-stuffed red pepper (excellent! second favorite dish), and a grilled petit fillet.

The fillet was primarily for my girlfriend, who does not eat fish or seafood. She had wanted the Kobe burger but they had run out. This was unfortunate because she was very disappointed with the steak. Although the rest of us did not have the same reaction, she was convinced that it had a peculiar flavor and ate very little of it. One of the other members of our party eventually concurred that there was something slightly distasteful, but not so much as to render it inedible. My girlfriend, however was adamant. She is familiar with eating all varieties of steaks, and she has a better sense of taste/smell than I do, so I had to take her word for it.

Fortunately, dessert left us with a good taste in our mouths. Among the three of us we enjoyed a fancy root beer float, some very tasty mini apple fritters (not at all heavy in the gut), and a savory plate of cheddar w/shaved fennel and honey. That last dish was paired with a glass of Madeira, selected for me by the chef. The combination of flavors and textures was a fantastic way to end the meal.

All of the above -- plus two bottles of wine from their impressive list of local and exotic imports -- resulted in a rather hefty check. But we had an enjoyable time for a special night out with friends (and let me mention again how great the service was) so we were satisfied with the outcome.",2007-10-08 20:04:35

 My refridgerator would quit when it was hot out (this was the first time we used it) so came home early and called service department, was told it would be three weeks before it could be looked at. So, we made due with a non-working fridge till one day we needed the generator, which started fine but generated nothing, no 12 volt or 110 volts, (this should have been checked in the pre delivery inspection) so came home early again and called to schedule an appt. with service department. Was told we could bring it up next Thursday at 10 am. I had a previous engagement, so ask if I could bring it up Wednesday the day before, was told no. so I ask if I could bring it up on a Saturday, was told I would have to schedule with the one who worked Sat. but he was not there. So called back the next day and scheduled my repair for the following Sat. finally got it up there and went through all of my needed repairs with the service writer, three weeks later I go to pick it up and, I will admit the generator worked (so far), but there is a lot of saw dust all over the floor where they were working, the spring shackles were never greased before delivery so I attempted to grease them myself and four of them would not take grease, I was told when I picked it up they were all greased and no problem was found, was told they took grease just fine, so when I got home I tried to grease them and surprise the same four fittings that would not take grease before, still won't. 
I could go on and on but out of all the items that were to be fixed under warranty, and I was told they were fixed, the only thing that was actually fixed was the generator,  they glued a door, and there is  stain that was dripped on the floor from fixing a door, and the mess of sawdust that was left on the floor where they worked on the generator.
This has been the worst service experience of my life, if I could, I would immediately sell this camper and get a different one, just because of this dealerships service. By the looks of the reviews I am not alone in my review.

I stopped in here while shopping some of the nearby boutiques last weekend on a visit to Nashville and was EXTREMELY APPALLED. If I could rate this place negative, I would. It almost put me in the hospital for the rest of my trip.

I have a very severe, life threatening, allergy to nuts which I stated to the blonde woman working when I entered. I asked if by chance any of their products were safe for me to eat or if there may be possibility of cross contamination. She wasn't friendly at all, but told me that I would be perfectly fine. 

I then ordered two chocolate chip cookies to go after again, checking to see if they contained anything with nuts. I left the store, and happened to look this company up online to see what their story was....I ended up finding nutrition information for some of their cookies, which included the ingredients of their chocolate chip cookies. The same is ordered. 

The ingredients state in plain sight that the cookies contained almond toffee with roasted almonds! It also had allergy information about the cookies containing nuts and being produced in a facility with several kinds of other nuts. 

THANK GOD I somehow looked at this before eating the cookies or trying a sample which they put out for people in the store. Had I eaten them, I would have gone into anaphylactic shock. 

I returned back to the store later that afternoon to let the girl know what happened and how terrible it would have been had I eaten the cookies she told me didn't have nuts in them. She looked blankly at me and said ""well yeah, they have almond extract in them"" which wasn't even accurate. There were two other people at that point working with her in the store, none who spoke up at all. I again stated that this was really very Important, and that people who have allergies need to know, because someone could end up in the  hospital or even dead from a mistake like this. Not one of the 3 apologized or showed any remorse, they just asked if I'd like a $5 refund for the 2 cookies. I took the refund, and again stated that it wasn't the money I cared about, but the fact that this whole experience wasn't ok.

Any food related business needs to be aware of allergies and the ingredients in their foods, especially with all of the different kinds of allergies people have today. I was SHOCKED by how poorly they handled this, and would caution people away from this place.",2019-12-29 15:50:22

Last May, I purchased two all season tires at Canadian Tire in South Common. I had two different all season tires that I had purchased previously the summer of 2016, and needed another two for my summer set. Canadian Tire in South Common did not have the same tires that I already had, but they did have two all seasons that fit my car in stock. I purchased these two, and that day they placed all four tires on my car, and took my winter tires off. 
In the fall, I opted to go to the Windermere Canadian tire for my tire changeover to winter tires, as south common didn't have any appointments that worked with my work schedule. I was very impressed with the service I've always received in south common, so this spring I decided to go back and have them change my winter tires to my summer set (the very same summer set they installed exactly a year ago). 
I made an appointment a few days in advance, and arrived at 8:55am (my appointment was at 9:00) and watched them pull my car in immediately. I did not receive a call until 2:58pm, where the gentleman on the phone claimed to had ""called and left a message that morning"" when I have no previous phone record of them contacting me that day. The guy on the phone proceeded to tell me that I only had two winter tires, and two seasonal tires, so they could not complete the tire changeover. I asked him ""so you're saying I have 6 winter tires, and 2 all seasons??"" And he begins to tell me that no, I only had 4 winter tires and 2 all seasons. I told him that I know for sure I had 4 tires in my car that morning. He then puts me on hold, and picks up to say ""you are correct, you have 4 tires but they're the wrong ones and we will not put them on"". I told him that it was the exact same set they had put on for me the year before, which he confirmed that they did the tire changeover for me last May, but he's ""not sure which tires"". Over and over again he reiterated that I had 2 winter tires, and 2 all seasons, and they refused to put them on. I told him I know for a fact I have a proper set of summer tires, to which he responds ""your only two options are to order the same tires you bought last year, or buy two different ones"" and at this point we had been back and forth on hold, and half of the stuff he was telling me wasn't making sense. I told him not to continue working on my car, and I would be in later with my boyfriend. 
Later when my boyfriend and I had gone in, my winter set of tires were on my car, and the lady behind the counter told me she didn't know what was happening, but her service manger would call me in the morning. 
The next morning the ""manager"" calls, and tells me that he has not spoken with his tire tech, so he's not sure who was correct. I told him once again that they had sold me two of my tires, and put my tires on for me a year ago. He tries to say that maybe I brought in the wrong tires. I told him that I only have one vehicle with 2 sets of tires, so no, they were the exact same tires as previously. I told him I felt as though they had tried to take advantage of me, as I had gone in alone, and they tried to tell me the ""only options I had"" was to spend more money on tires at their location. I also told him all I was looking for was an apology for the waste of my day, as I already was planning on going elsewhere, and he told me he's ""sorry for the experience but without talking to his tech, he's not sure what's going on"" but asked me to email him pictures of my tires ""so he could really see who was wrong"". 
That same day, I sent him pictures of my tires, and screenshots of the website where it clearly states all 4 of my tires are all seasons. Over two days later, no reply. 
I will not be returning, but they did not seem to care in the slightest. Beware of the scam artists behind the service desk who may try to convince you to spend more money than needed.",2018-05-28 13:07:55

I ordered a large Hot sake as soon as we sat. The staff kept walking past us for about 10 minutes when I flagged one down and told here were were NOT having All You Can Eat. I told her our order:

Deluxe sashimi dinner
Beef teriyaki with shrimp tempura 
(Large Hot Sake)

I have been reducing my Carbs the last few months and I remembered they had a nice sashimi deluxe dinner with 16 pieces of fish. It includes miso soup, cabbage salad, a small bowl of Rice and the fish (salmon, tuna, shrimp and yellow tail. The fish pieces were generous and fresh (if not frozen?) 

One of the servers brought us our Miso Soup and still no Hot Sake. I asked about it and the person apologized and got it. When she returned with it, I told her there was a problem with the Miso. She immediately asked if it was too salty. It was extremely salty, and I asked how she knew. She said that sometimes people complain that it's too salty. She took The soups away and my wife ordered a "" watermelon limeade drink.'  After about 10 minutes one of the servers brought my wife's beef teriyaki with shrimp to the table next to us. They said it was not their dinner, and I told her it was ours. I reminded her that we still did not have my wife's cocktail, she said she had not made it yet. I asked her since we're already having dinner if it was possible for her to make it now? So she said OK and left. She brought it within a couple of minutes and my wife did like it. 

The food was actually really good. My wife really liked the teriyaki beef and though the shrimp was more breaded than it was tempura, she enjoyed it.
Salad had a bit too much dressing, as well as the miso soup to concentrated? 

The main issues we had, besides taking forever to get hot sake and a cocktail, Was they never came back and asked if it we wanted  anything more. Never offered us another drink or hot sake. They never once asked if our food was satisfactory. Finally, they never cleared anything off of our table. Our table had tons of dishes (please look at the photos) and the table was small. We actually had no room to pack up leftovers. 

They were plenty of workers. At least four in the sushi area and four or five servers running in and out of the kitchen. There was only five tables and half of the bar was full. It's a shame as we could've had more drinks, and definitely wanted a dessert.",2021-10-01 04:18:56

I watched the coffee scene come up and evolve into what it is today. For the last few years I was in Portland, I frequented Stumptown cafes several times per week, as well as other notable bars. I still receive reports and samples from Portland and I am affiliated with a high-end roaster in another state. With all of that on the table, I'll proceed.

On my way to Portland Brew for the first time, I was excited and hopeful, but my expectations were reasonably high. After all, if you want to represent the Portland coffee scene - which sets the standard for most others - you better bring it. Still, I did not wish to make a specific comparison to another bar; I just wanted to feel like I was sipping a cup in a Portland cafe.

In short, I was disappointed with the cup, in terms of the flavor profile, overall composition and presentation. It was not the worst espresso drink I've had, but it was truly uninspiring. The atmosphere was a bit bland; although, I heard some music that sounded like it could have been any number of college-radio-oriented Portland bands. Sadly, it was not enough to evoke the level of bittersweet nostalgia required to actually change my perception of what I had in my cup.

I have been back twice in the last 2 months, hoping that my initial visit was just an ""off"" day for them. Unfortunately, each time, the espresso drinks were worse. I heard more predictable music and saw more of the attitude I'm used to behind the counter at many Portland coffee shops. However, when I get a touch of attitude or pretense from someone behind the bar at Stumptown, I give the barista a pass, simply because the cup is stellar beyond compare. One sip and all is forgiven. 

Like I always say: I only hold you to your own standard. So, if you want to represent Portland-style coffee, you better bring it. Based on my experience, Portland Brew is not that. I wish with all my heart that it were, because I would move in and drive up their sales by my emphatic and relentless endorsements. Maybe one day, but for now, I cannot recommend Portland Brew to anyone curious for a taste of Portland coffee.",2014-11-29 17:54:57

In modern times, the ""Big J"" was modernized with radar and missiles to serve in Ronald Reagan's 600 ship navy in the Mediterranean and later return to the Pacific.  Her guns went silent in 1991 when she was decommissioned from active service and later ceded to her namesake state to become a museum ship in 2001.

We'd come here over 10 years ago (long before Yelp) and I owed the NJ a return visit and a review.  It's fitting that we came back on Veterans Day also.  A lot of history is encompassed in her steel hull, from her birth at the Philadelphia Naval shipyard across the Delaware river to her present berth in Camden, NJ.  From her triple 16"" gun turrets that fired on beaches of Leyte Gulf to her modern Tomahawk missiles, New Jersey is a national monument to the sailors that fought for our freedoms for over 50 years.

You can tour the ship on your own or have a knowledgeable docent to show you all the ins, outs, ups & downs of this 58,000 ton vessel.  Along the guided path, you see the crews quarters, the luxurious Captain's cabin, Ward Room and and the gigantic Crews Mess that fed almost 2000 crew members 3 squares a day.  Walking on the topside decks, it's like a time warp when you see the WWII era weapons like the 5"" anti-aircraft gun turrets, right next to the high-tech Harpoon missiles, Phalanx CIWS and radar systems.  You can also feel the history of the thousands of sailors that walked on the teak wood decks before you.  You'll notice some of the teak decks are currently being renovated & replaced and look incredible.  Just be careful as you go up & down the steep ladders and don't miss crawling into the tight confines of the aft 16"" gun turret.

New Jersey's 3 sisters all became museum ships as well, with Iowa in Los Angeles, CA, Missouri in Pearl Harbor, HI and Wisconsin in Norfolk, VA.

So if we wanted the full bottle the price was double, we decided on something and she ordered it by the glass for the each of us. Mind you our reservation was at 830 by this time it is now about a quarter after 9. We have ordered our dinner in between all this. My fiance and I order the Chateaubriand for two and our friend orders the petite filet, asparagus and a seasonal salad. Her salad looked fine and no issues there. Then at about almost 945 our dinners come out. This is where it went rapidly downhill. Her steak was under cooked, she sent it back. Ours came out shortly after and not only was ours under cooked but everything with the exception of the gratin potatoes was cold. I did try a bite of the meat before we had to send it back and it was ok. The potatoes were good. What came back after we sent it back was perhaps one of the worst meals I have had. The meat had zero flavor and tasted as if maybe it had been microwaved. I've had better steaks at Outback for a lot less money. The gratin had absolutely no flavor at all. At this point it's almost 11. With both dinners going back and the other issues, you'd think the manager would have come over to the table, nope too busy checking glasses for spots. Absolutely not woth the money paid for it. I have no problem with higher prices if the food and service merit but in this case it was an incredibly expensive disappointment. I had read reviews from people who had experiences similar to mine and thought about going to a different restaurant, next time I'll listen to my gut instinct. I will not be returning nor recommending to anyone.",2016-11-15 16:53:39
Vnl_WAHCOKeLDY18zm0CNQ,CELevXfGA3Yl5XiAKmsA_Q,CHchZtKKu5Pjewo2gs9qgQ,5.0,2,3,0,"Okay, so I was hesitant to get lashed for a couple of reasons. 

#1 - I naturally have long healthy lashes, so I didn't see the point. But my natural lashes are very light and straight and curling them and piling on mascara everyday gets old. 
#2 - I've heard horror stories of people losing their lashes after getting extensions. 

That said,  I decided to give NASHVILLE LASH a try anyway. After all, I've heard that some of the biggest celebs in Nashville trust their lashes to these gals, so I should too. 

I've been 3 times and seen both ""Amy's"". They are both AMAZING!!!! One is the owner - one just works there. Both are equally great at what they do. 

I can totally see how if done incorrectly your lashes could be affected. That is why it's important you don't go just anywhere. I can also see why people would ""panic"" when the extensions start to fall off as new lashes grow in, etc. I even sent a ""panic"" text to my girl saying - OMG I think my lashes have broken off.  BUT if you look closely you will see that is NOT the case. These lashes are designed to fall off with the growth of your new lashes. And we shed a ton of lashes everyday. So if you see your lash attached to the extension - that is normal!  Also if you see stubby lashes, that is likely ""new growth"" that isn't done growing. Or can also just be that your eyes are playing tricks on you.  When you have these extensions on your lashes look long, full and flawless. So your natural lash sitting next to an extension is going to look like a baby compared to them. 

They are great for a special occasion and I suggest that is when you first get them. But trust me when I say they are ADDICTIVE and you will want them on all the time. I can't wait to have them on this summer - perfect lashes at the beach and pool - what?!?! 

The best advice I can give is TAKE CARE OF THEM! They are already waterproof and ""life proof"" for the most part, but if you touch them as little as possible, wash around them and don't use mascara on them (you don't need it) and buy the $30 sealant to use at home (it's a big tube) - then they will last much longer!",2013-02-04 23:49:03
voAVMldLxBB_pEQVcXTJuA,tUOu1UnFolo6NLQ6c7ws5A,qFLbefcc75RxiMvyibEPhw,1.0,4,6,0,"The Book Gallery has a very garage sale bargain bin feel. The shelves reach to the ceiling, which may not always be a good thing, as even a tall person such as myself has difficulty reaching that tome on the top. The ""old book smell"" that I love is firmly engraved in every page.

My biggest annoyance is how little the owner seems to know about the books he carries. He has no system to catalog books, so if you're looking for something specific, don't bother asking. Just look for the proper section, if you're very lucky it'll be shelved properly. The owner didn't even know who wrote The Three Musketeers! I find that incredibly shocking.

I have shopped here a few times and each visit is worse then before. I refuse to shop here and will go to the other used book stores for my literary fix.

UPDATE---
On the behest of my mother, who thought through a misleading television add that the books were on sale, I went once more into this shabby little shop. I spent a half hour searching the disorganized stacks in search of a short list of tomes she wished to acquire. I was almost done and ready to pay when a man I can only assume was the owner started to demand my name. I refused to give it without just cause which only served to infuriate him further. 

He then said that I shouldn't go about ""bashing shops"". I had no idea what he was speaking of at the time, but had made up my mind that I was leaving. I told him as much and left my purchase where it sat, stating that I would never again, for any reason, set foot in his horrid, filthy shop again. (There were cobwebs everywhere. I can be almost certain that they were in existence before Kidd Carson rode through!) He went so far as to kick me out while I was well on my way down the side walk. 

Once I had left, I figured out the reason for his angst. Before that day, I had a photograph as a profile picture. He recognized me from here, dear friends, and was not pleased with the review I had left. Had he used the review as a way to better his store then I think we may have been fine and I certainly would have amended my review to reflect such improvement. Sadly, he did not and lost at least three customers that I can think of, perhaps more. 

This was a mistake on his part because, you see, I spent $40 at a used book store just an hour later. Word of advice: If you make a poor review of the Book Gallery, be prepared for repercussions.",2011-02-07 17:11:40

It's one of those spacious geometric shabby chic loft style restaurants which, is loud and echo-y. Try to snag a seat upstairs next to a window. I liked that part of the restaurant the best. 
Not only did I get a kick out of the decor I also enjoyed the fact that your water glass is a recycled jar and they leave a couple of recycled bottles full of cold water on the table. 
For some reason I expected the food to be rich, awesome and satisfying. They are the commissary kitchen for 4Hands, a local microbrewery, and the food I've had of theirs has been pretty unbelievable...especially the charcuterie plate!!!!
But instead the offering was really very average and not impressive. They have all of these different burgers, many for 10 dollars each--ok fine. I'm cool with a 10 dollar burger. But...and here's my 'big butt' ;-) for ten dollars it should be cooked to perfection. This burger is not overly big--well that's ok. I don't need quantity. The burgers which claimed to be 'smoked' had no smoky flavor at all. And none were cooked to the specification of each person at the table I got the LGBT, lettuce, goat cheese, bacon and tomato. Despite my burger not coming out medium rare at all, not being juicy (in fact even being dry) I thought the toppings were good quality and a very good combo.
My friend got the smoke and fire which once again was a great combo. My husband got the plain burger, because, hey, if you're at a burger joint you go for the burger right...well you really need the toppings here. The bun is also pretty good and seemed homemade.
In addition to burgers we ordered the big fries which serviced three of us and came with two 'homemade sauces'. We chose curry katusp which I actually thought was good--I'm usually not a fan of curry katusp and the 'horsey' sauce which I didn't think was as good. The fries were average. Not the authentic fresh cut style I'd pictured. And they weren't nice and hot, were slightly limp and none too crisp. If they are indeed house made I'd be surprised. Our other friend just ordered pretzels and cheese sauce and man, was that good! Good cheese sauce --order with confidence!
I do respect that the burgers are grass fed so you're not going to hear me complain about the price. I respected the bun and the pickle was quite good probably homemade.
I could see myself going again. I would lean toward a themed burger, but split it with a friend and probably skip the fries and get a milkshake. 

Yeah, I'll do that.",2012-10-29 01:17:00

Usually food in airports is somewhat decent (or at least has some sort of appeal). This is the only open place to eat at the Reno Airport, bc they are remodeling. We went there twice- this review is a mashup of both visits!

THE ORDER:
Asian Veggie Stir Fry w Brown Rice- 2.5 stars. While the veggies were yummy, there weren't that many :( The sauce was tasty, but definitely not unique. The rice itself was a bit mushy and not very fresh. Portion size was weak. But, this dish did taste good.

BLT w Fries- 3 stars. The BLT itself was pretty good! Crunchy, chewy, etc. The fries were a bit lackluster. Obviously fresh cut potatoes, which is a plus, but overall boring. I added tabasco and ketchup to these poor little puppies!

Bean Soup- 2 stars. We were told this was a delightful bean and veggie soup with a bit of a kick. Sounds good to me! Well, it had some sort of ground meat in it (which i don't think counts as a vegetable?), no flavor and not a hint of spice. I added salt. 

1/2 Mountain House Salad + 1/2 Big Game Meatloaf Sandwich...2 stars. The meatloaf itself was really good; thick, flavorful, dense, etc. It's a blend of venison, beef, and elk.   The chipotle BBQ sauce was a nice touch, but it needed more. I doused it with plenty of Tabasco and it was yummy.The 1/2 house salad SUCKED balls! There was little to no dressing...it was plated on a heated plate and then sat below a heat lamp. That makes no sense...at all. It's SALAD! And, the salad portion was ridiculously small. Might as well have been a garnish.

Cheese Toast- 3 stars. While this was simple and ghetto, it tasted good in an unhealthy, greasy way. Cheddar cheese atop of a weak french roll, served grilled with roasted tomatoes and garlic. It was actually good, just not very gourmet. Looks like something they'd think was fancy at a trailer park.

THE SERVICE:
2 stars. Just bad. Bad cooks, bad waitstaff. There were a few people who were great, like the bus boy, etc., tho, so I can't discredit all of them!

OVERALL:
Well, I guess I'll have no choice but to eat here again if its the only place open still....but, next time, I'll go for a burger and a strawberry shake.  A bit overpriced when you consider slow service and lame portion sizes.

ALSO:
They didn't have any spicy option but Tabasco. No Sriracha, no Tapatio, no chili flakes :(

I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANY TRAVELING YELPER!!

While the service was fine and the space was quite nice, I thought the food was extremely inconsistent and at times really difficult to eat. I went here for restaurant week this week and they offered a chef's tasting for an upcharge ($55/person) from the regular restaurant week special that my party chose to try. 

The good: Of the many dishes they brought out the star of the show was the pulpo (grilled octopus) with a spicy tomato sauce and olive aioli that was aesthetically beautiful and tasted great and showed a clear culinary vision. That dish tasted like something that a restaurant that gets a 26/30 in Zagat should be putting out. The pork belly montadito was good albeit uninspired. It a bit too oily and monotonous in flavor, and tasted like a well cooked slab of pork on top of bread, still pleasant though. A sea bass dish with a thick lemony sauce with a light salsa verde and cockles was probably the second best dish I was served and was also pleasing and a clear demonstration of elevated cuisine. Additionally, the $15 wine pairing (restaurant week special) was a good value for two glasses of wine at a restaurant. There was also an adequate amount of food that was served which was good.

The bad: I had a chicken dish with Brussels sprouts that featured chicken that was so bone dry it was almost flaky in texture and inedible. I regret not sending it back and expressing my disgust in person because that chicken should not have been fed to people. The chorizo pamplona came with a mealy white accompaniment with little flavor and an awkward mouthfeel and I really didn't enjoy it. Their patatas riojanas were well cooked but the wrong size to be enjoyed properly, the inside had too much starchiness and texturally ruined the dish. Think of a bad steak-cut french fry with a decent seasoning. The pan chocolate (chocolate bread) with mousse is something that I could do without as well and was basically a chocolate crouton in a mediocre mousse and left me with a mediocre taste in my mouth that was encompassing of the entire meal experience.

In sum: Overpriced. Inconsistent. Would not recommend. Space is aesthetically beautiful and there is a good selection of Iberian wines. Some dishes were good, but some were really, truly, awful. Sister restaurant Amada is really much better in every way. Disappointing from Chef Garces.",2016-01-22 05:21:56

It is 6:09pm and a lady claiming to be the manager was so very rude to me it was unbelievable. I just found this place and have eaten at this same location everyday this week. My visit on yesterday was a bit offputting because a young lady was at the food counter where food is prepared on her cell phone. She put her cell phone away shortly after I walked up to the counter and then reached for gloves and put them on. However, I don't see the use of putting on clean gloves with dirty hands. Cell phones are disgusting. When I realized that she was the one preparing my food I asked another worker to make it over and they did with no problem. Today, I walk in and the same lady is at the food counter with her cell phone. I ordered my food and requested quite nicely that that particular worker not touch my food. She heard my request and started to yell at me saying ""it's my job to touch your food so I'll just refund you!"" I said ""No ma'am, I'll just have it remade until someone else makes it because I'm not leaving here without my food. She insisted that I didn't have a choice about who makes my food. I asked for the manager and she said I'm the manager so you'll have to just talk to me. I said well if you're a manager then I need to speak to corporate. She said take a card with the email on it, they are right on the counter. Keep in mind she is 2 people away from me yelling across the counter. Another employee begs her to wash her hands but at this point I don't want her touching my food washed hands or not. She disappeared in the back and didn't come out until I was leaving the counter. The cashier apologized. She also told me that the manager was not in at that time. This is why I'm confused about the rude lady saying she was the manager. Her defense was that she was only showing them a screenshot as if that makes a difference. I get it, when eating out, you never know what's really going on with your food but the minute I can see the uncleanliness, all bets are off. I'm not knowingly eating from your cell phone hands. I read on the site that Mooyah franchises are usually ran by families and that may or may not be the reason why the manager believes that it is o.k. for her to behave that way but companies don't get very far treating people this way. Please have someone from corporate contact me.

Y3Sr7ScROMqlYxAQQX0Qbw,A747Rq9d7aY-bQroAIQ3qA,Ps7Q7BOKzJO4nDTUhbk43Q,4.0,1,0,0,"This was our first time at Clear Sky Cafe as we are residents of Orlando and was in Clearwater for my sister in law's 25th birthday! 
To start, I would whole heartedly give this place a 5, however, that is always a tough one for me, but I have nothing but positive statements and regards to Clear Sky Cafe as a first time comer from out of town. 
To start, we were a table of 6 and had come in around
10:30pm, starving and ready to eat. It was on 08/08 a Saturday night, so of course we had to make reservations due to it being a busy night.

Getting right to it, everything was amazing. The food was great, however I felt - it was slightly over priced for the quality of it. I did not like how removal of bacon was not an option for the Two Baked Potato, as that shows me how (maybe?) they're not fresh. However, it's loaded with cheese and scallions and still taste great! Our party ordered everything app (basically) off the menu so we were able to have a variety of things. We had the octopus, scallops w gniocci, Brussels sprouts, raw and grilled oysters, & dynamite shrimp. 


**** Unfortunately, our Brussels sprouts were burnt over the top.
When my boyfriend asked our server if she saw anything was wrong w them, she was HONEST and did say they looked a little burnt. Without hesitation, she was so quick to fix the error. She took initiative of the issue and found a solution she felt that would make us happy. 

Along with a lot of more entrees - portobello flatbread, sesame chicken (our brother was not a fan), lobster Max &cheese, shrimp scampi (MY ABSOLUTE FAV! Only order if you like lemon sauce! It was amazing. ) , Grouper Oscar - this was the dish I felt was over priced. I understand it's market price/market value, however, if that's the case, they needed to make it over top and full of flavor! Unfortunately, we felt it was cooked great, but definitely more bland and definitely not worth $40 for
grouped and veggies. & lastly we had Jumbalaya. 

I'd like to say the food was memorable experience, but what really made our experience wonderful was our server Zoe. She was nothing short of amazing, and I wish I could explain in a greater word of how fantastic she was, but I'm still so full from my meal! 
Zoe was incredible. We had some issues besides the Brussels, like the chicken, and in each scenario she was caring, patient, suggestive, honest, and extremely sweet and nice. This is all coming from a table of (6 total) but of 2 servers, a business owner, and just a tough table
to please when it comes to food! She did everything right in our eyes as a great server, and then more. Her
personality made us laugh throughout our night but also made us happy that we got sat in her section. She was extremely attentive towards all of us and we appreciated that bc things went smooth bc of her. She was truly the start of meals! 

When we do come back in the future, we will ask for Zoe and suggest her to any friends we send to Clear Sky Cafe.

Thank you Zoe and Clear Sky Cafe for a great night and amazing service.",2020-08-09 05:17:41
kP3QRRbw1lll06LJq2BZtQ,VPvzpBnHfY-JUnL7x-gETg,82BEr5Vk1h4tIZAiA6IPGw,1.0,14,0,0,"This doctor's office has been a nightmare for me. I scheduled a routine pap as a new patient and had to wait months for my appointment date. I waited for the appointment because I was told she was a great doctor. I went for a routine pap and was asked about my medical history as a new patient. I have been diagnosed with Endometriosis in the past and continue to struggle with it so I talked with her about that. When I was checking out, as expected, I was told that I did not owe a copay because it is covered under my insurance plan for women's wellness. I received a bill a short time after for the visit and was told by my insurance company, BC/BS, that Dr. Ross had coded the visit as a ""problem visit"", and the visit was now subject to a high copay. It feels absolutely violating to me that as a new patient, you can be billed for a copay after your appointment for answering questions honestly during what is supposed to be a covered yearly women's wellness exam. The insurance company told me that this is a common way for doctors to get out of having to honor the Affordable Care Act's women's wellness provisions. My insurance company told me that there was nothing I could do about it and that every visit is subject to whatever the doctor codes the visit for. I called the doctor's office and was told that because we discussed my medical history, it was considered a ""problem visit"". When I talked with management at Touro about this, they informed me that whatever the doctor codes the visit for is what I have to pay. 

What is the point of a women's wellness exam if you are a new patient and talk with your doctor about your medical history when they ask for it and then it gets coded as a different kind of visit after you leave the office? It is fraudulent and wrong, especially as a female doctor. This is the kind of greed that the Affordable Care Act is supposed to help correct, but it looks like doctors and the healthcare industry will always find a way around the law. 

Before I received this bill, I had scheduled follow-up exams for handling the problems that I was billed for in the ""problem visit""/yearly pap, and had to have lab work done. Dr. Ross is in my insurance network and all labs are to be covered at 100%. The doctor's office was not sending the lab work to in-network labs and I received additional bills for the original pap and another lab in follow-up visits, now subject to out of network co-pays. When I called the insurance company and the lab about this, I was told that the doctor's office was using out-of-network labs and not submitting the claims properly. I just received another bill stating I am going to be turned over to a collection agency for labs that are covered by my insurance at 100%. I have called Dr. Ross' office at least five times regarding these bills and have been told that they would look into it and take care of it. The insurance company told me that even though this doctor is an in-network provider, doctors can send labs to wherever they want and the patient is responsible for the lab bill no matter what the doctor chooses and what your insurance policy says. 

What a racket! 

When doctors and insurance companies wonder why patients are disgusted by the healthcare industry, this is why. Thinking about it all makes me sick to my stomach. 

In general, I found Dr. Ross to be disinterested and condescending when speaking with her. In my experience with OB/GYNs, it is difficult to find a caring doctor when you have female medical problems, but they treat pregnant women with a lot of respect and care. It always makes me feel terrible. Dr. Ross was running considerably behind schedule for every appointment I scheduled with her as I waited and watched pregnant women come in after me and leave one after the other while I was still waiting for my appointment in her office. Dr. Ross literally left me with a shrug about the problems I've been experiencing and it made me feel like I am not a human being. 

I would strongly urge anyone not to choose Dr. Ross or the Touro network if you are looking for good healthcare. This doctor's office/network is concerned with booking more patients than they have time or care for and making as much money as possible from you while you wait for appointments and figure out billing problems yourself. Do not expect high-quality service or care here. If anyone reading this has experience with a great OB/GYN, please let me know! I am searching for a doctor in the area that will treat me and the problems I'm experiencing with respect, care, and honesty.",2016-06-14 20:59:28

I'm rarely excited about the cut, and very few people can style my hair without making me look like a Simpson's character.   When I lived in DC, I finally found a wonderful salon that was affordable AND had a hairdresser that I loved.  However, when I moved to Philly, it became kind of silly to keep trekking to DC to get my hair cut.  One day I bit the bullet and went to the Aveda Institute.  I figured that since most $40 hair cuts look awful on me, paying $16 for a bad cut wouldn't be the end of the world.  

I was amazed at my cut that day, and I've been happy every time I've come back.  Granted, cuts generally take at least an hour and a half (and once took 3 hours), and if having the student periodically check in with their teacher over your hair freaks you out, this may not be the place for you.  But if you're willing to roll the dice and take a chance, you MAY walk out with a million dollar cut and style for a ridiculously cheap price.   Even the not so great students that I've had have given me a reasonable cut, still much better than anything else I could get for $20!

My complaints: it's immensely frustrating to find someone that cuts your hair perfectly, styles it so that you look like a million bucks, and is pleasant chat with, only to realize that in 6 months they will graduate and go to work in some high end salon where they'll charge $100 a pop.

My advice: Keep in mind that it's always a roll of the dice; the more you gamble, the more you stand to win (or lose).  If you're brave enough to give them so room to work (a cut instead of a trim, a style of their choice, etc), you might just get something amazing.  Most of the students get a little nervous when you tell them to do what they want, but since most people just have them cut of a half inch, they also get pretty excited.  I've gotten lucky twice; one girl cut my hair short this summer and it was an amazing cut, today my girl straightened my hair and it looks adorable!  Next time, I might go for a color change, just for fun!

I've also come to Aveda for waxing... IMO, it's not really worth it.  You can get so many cheap, good waxes in this city, that it's not always worth having a student use you as practice.",2008-12-09 19:26:40
VkVQhWhKfN-632Qw0fMvUA,kk6Z7YtXEZlgrCzlKPKQpA,OOH4Y_7s_SpEexhmcyFfxw,1.0,28,4,4,"I've been a customer with Sun East Federal Credit Union for 7 years now.  Their customer service and online banking have recently taken a turn.
I recently moved.  I visited the local branch to discover that the bank requires proof of the address change.  Funny, my other credit union, investment firm and insurance companies don't require this level of detail.  In fact, you can change this information on their websites.  Does Sun East realize this is 2014?  The branch manager refused to make the address change in their system, handed us change of address forms and a self-addressed/postage paid letter.  How much can one expect from a branch manager that posts Continuing Education certificates as if they were a graduate degree posted on the wall in a doctor's office?  Maybe he should focus more on taking care of the customer rather than acting like a big shot.  I don't post my 8th grade report cards at my office.
A few days later, I received a letter in the mail.  It was an envelope with my new address handwritten.  The letter detailed instructions to visit a local branch to get new debit/credit cards issued in lieu of the recent Home Depot malware scandal.  Hackers managed to penetrate their system and compromise credit card information.  We returned to the same local branch.  The place was packed and staff was shorthanded.  After 30 minutes, we met with the Asst. Manager.  She updated our address in the system for one of three accounts.  Apparently, the other 2 accounts had the new address entered into the system.  To the branch manager, that's egg in your face.  I appreciate the rigmarole and the lie.  Next, the Asst. Manager issued new debit cards for us referencing the letter and the Home Depot hack.  Half way through the process, she asked if the letter said which cards were affected by the Home Depot hack.  We didn't have the letter on us, but it didn't specify which cards.  The letter said that each branch is now equipped with card printers to avoid waiting 5-10 business days via mail.  By the way, Commerce Bank (TD bank present day) was printing debit cards at the branch level back in 2002.  Sun East is glacially slow to catch up banking innovations.  There was no detail about specific cards affected, hence the expectation is for the bank to replace each card.  It is incumbent on them, especially if they offered the service in a letter.  The assistant manager said the bank usually charges $5 for replacement cards.  I wasn't about to pay for new cards.  A prime example of the bank making a subtle attempt to capitalize and profit from their customer's misfortunes.  Sun East is supposed to issue the new cards, not be applauded for doing it.  This should be automatic.  Even scarier, the Assistant Manager asked if we, the customer, knew which cards were compromised from the Home Depot scandal.  Why doesn't Sun East know which cards were compromised?  This adds an additional level of concern that the bank had enough knowledge to mail the letter, but doesn't know which cards were affected?  It's scary to think that they handle money.
Finally, I want to comment on the ""new"" online banking system.  Sun East mailed out pamphlets with details and instructions on how to use and navigate their new online website.  Sounds good, right?  Continue reading.  The new online system doesn't offer a memo feature that allows the customer to make a note when making a transfer.  It helps the customer make notes about the purpose of the transfer.  Well, Sun East decided to remove this feature.  I spoke to both the Branch Manager and the Call Center representative and neither knew why.  The Call Center representative could care less.  The Branch Manager said that the new supplier they outsourced the online banking to doesn't offer this feature.  Well, why didn't your bank ask if they had the capacity to keep this helpful tool?  Sun East offered visibility to pending transaction and holds on the old online system.  The new online system did away with this feature as well.  This feature afforded me ability to view any pending charges to my account.  Restaurants have been notorious to double charge my card for meals.  Now, I have to wait for the transaction to post to my account, before disputing the charge.  What's the point of showing me my available balance, if I can't even see the pending charges?  In summary, Sun East is all about saving a buck and investing in downgraded online banking systems.  Hey, we have this wonderful new online banking system with colorful marketing.  It is more like ""putting lipstick on a pig"".  The rebranded online banking system is a downgrade for customers, not an upgrade.  This once great credit union needs to refocus its customer service, innovations and employ a more common sense process.  Responses such as ""No, we cannot do that."" Or ""We're not allowed to do that."" Aren't going to improve your market share.",2014-10-05 16:26:38

I understand people make mistakes.  But when they get your to-go order wrong you think they would understand the urgency of making things right ASAP since the part of the order they got right is rapidly getting cold and turning into more like leftovers than the Friday treat that was planned.  

Ya think that they would let the rest of our order (that they forgot to put in) jump the cue - But our 25 minutes wait for egg rolls was longer than the 20 minutes for our original order and no one even said sorry for this mistake- not once. Finally getting the rest of the order we drove home.

I thought back to the last time we ate at the Wild Ginger and the two of us ordered 4 appetizers and an entree.  I remembered the young man waiting on us saying, ""you want more rice?"" when we went through the 1 cup of rice we were given (you get a pint when you order this entree to go).  I didn't say anything when I saw the $1.50 additional charge on our bill for rice.
These problems are the front of the house I thought- the mistakes and over charging ...... at least the food is still good.

Not Any More- when we got home and sat down to enjoy our cold food (and we really thought it would still be enjoyable) our stiff little scallion pancakes were black on one side giving them not much more flavor than charcoal.  Honestly we tried to eat some of them because by this time we were really hungry.  But the worst was the (one pepper) mildly hot spiced (yet cold to the touch) entree we order and started to scarfed down way too fast.  It was so overly spiced that it was like a volcano erupting out of my stomach.  By the time I knew what was happening - that I just swallowed several mouthfuls of lava- my stomach was throwing it back out.  I was on fire from my stomach through my chest and into my mouth.  Even though most of it came up almost instantaneously the burning wouldn't stop and I had to get it out of me. So for my encore I used my two-fingered friend to rid myself of this horrible meal.  

Now that the front and the back of the house (kitchen) are both a bad bet, I would not recommend stopping in for careless, unapologetic, price-gouging treatment and burnt or very over spiced (stomach fire) carelessly made disappointing food.

p.s. be warned:  this was a vegan meal.  I shudder at the thought of what they do to meat.",2015-08-01 03:48:38
O4wxLUIeWbH59tSDkIf9VA,ZC5O1uLKjSMRqND0S5bgDQ,7xJKAPgtTFPTYknqtqo-8w,1.0,0,0,0,"Last week I was looking for earplugs, a set of two, to be exact. The older sales guy with the glasses and blond hair, when asked where they were, just gave me, an R-U-blind-they are right in front of you, btw I am busy and have no time for you-kinda response. 
He was right, I was standing in front of the display and he was crouching on the other side, doing some kind of work. 
I guess walking around without your reading glasses is not something, I recommend, when visiting the sports man's warehouse in Tucson unless you want to be ridiculed. I didn't took it personal because, that sales guy didn't know me personally. I figured, he is just a dick with everybody. I thanked him for his kindly help and walked away. 
""Hey, Sir....sir, hey""! Somebody was shouting behind me. The shouting got louder. At first, I didn't pay attention and kept walking, but the shouting continued. People kept looking at me and then behind me, when I realized that Mr. Dick was yelling at me. He did this in such calculating way, that it almost sounded as if there had been a problem, caused by me of course. His tone, the volume and his Hey-I am talking to -You, you better respond to me-or-else kind of way. 
I knew he was a dick by the way he had treated me earlier and now it was time to give Mr.Dick his so badly wanted attention. 
I turned around and as soon as I did, Mr Dick, softened his voice and said, ""I got them here, pointing at the display with the earplugs.""
I thanked him but told him that I didn't needed them anymore before walking out of the store. 
Today, I decided to buy a rifle scope for no more than $500 out the door everything included. 
I was hesitating between a few brands and having problems with my eyesight, I knew that ordering online was out of question. I needed to look though them and make sure that I was able to see clearly. 
I went to a few places in Tucson but wasn't able to find what I wanted, so I decided to go back to the sportsman's warehouse. Before approaching the scope section, I looked around, hoping that Mr.Dick wasn't working today. He was nowhere to be seen. That was a good sign! I approached the scope counter and started looking at the different models. Eventually, a young salesman, carrying eyeglasses too, asked me if I needed help. 
I told him my budget and needed to compare a few brands within that price range. He showed me a few scopes but quickly made me understand that he didn't have to much time for me. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to see clearly with any of the scopes he was showing me. Eventually, I looked trough a $499 Leupold and was able to see pretty good. I like that scope but now I had to come up with another $150 for the scope mount. 
Still undecided whether I should go over my budget, thinking of my maxed out credit cards, I finally decided to give it a go and asked the by-now-annoyed young man if the had a quick detach mount for the Leupold. 
He directed me toward a section to where to find the scope mounts and told me to go there and do it quick!
Quick? Wow! I was surprised but expected another Dick behavior, especially since he was getting annoyed, me looking through at least 5 scopes, wasting his precious time. 
I walked toward the scope Mount display and looked at them. I saw a detachable scope mount for $159 but didn't know if it was compatible with the scoop. Since felt pretty disrespected for the second time I decided not yo buy anything at this location and didn't even bother to ask any further questions. 
I lingered around for a while, took pictures of the Leupold, made some phone calls and found the exact same scope for $458 at Murphy's gun
Not only did I pay $41 less, they also offered to mount the scope on my rifle for free and they also had a quick detach warren scope mount for $118. 
I was impressed with their service like always. I have been shopping at Murphy's a few times so far and every time I go there, I get real professional and friendly service. One person at Murphy's that stands out in knowledge, friendliness and helpfulness is Patrick. If you ever go to Murphy's and meet him in person you'll understand why Murphy's is the best place to buy guns & related items in Tucson. Thank you Murphy's Guns for being there when I needed you!

Also a big thank you to Sportsman's warehouse for hiring dicks that helped me indirectly save almost $100 today!

Note: At the front desk of this Sports man's location is a very unpleasant cashier. She has long dark hair and never smiles. When asked a question, she gives you a mean look. Experienced that 3 times with her. Pretty angry person. Otherwise the other cashiers are friendly!",2021-10-21 06:47:01

Real life situation number 1: You are in a cavern in Hawaii. You've retrieved the jewel-encrusted sceptre that O'Malley had hidden there years before, but the narrow opening to the cavern has collapsed. Your sidekick, Felipe, has thrown you a rope from the opening. The only thing that stands between you and freedom is 200 feet of rope and open air. You begin the ascent with ease.

Now aren't you glad you went to Philadelphia School of Circus Arts?

Real life situation number 2: As you are climbing, you hear a rumble. Mount Klauea is angry and has chosen a terrible time to vent. The tremors of the volcano shake the entire cavern, sending rocks and debris falling down upon your shoulders. A boulder the size of a boar hits your pack, tearing the nylon straps. The sceptre begins to fall. 

You wrap your legs around the rope and go upside-down, bracing the rope with your left and reaching out with your right. With perfect form, you catch the sceptre and continue climbing up. Even amidst the din of the crashing rocks, you can hear Felipe applaud.

Now aren't you glad you went to Philadelphia School of Circus Arts?

Real life situation number 3: You can smell fresh air. You have 20 feet to go. You hear signs of a struggle and Felipe's smiling face is suddenly pulled from view. The grimacing visage of Hannigan appears.

""Give me the Sceptre or Felipe dies.""
""Damn you Hannigan!"" You shout.
He holds a bowie knife against the rope and one of his cronies sends down a trapeze.
""Tie the sceptre to the trapeze.""
You know that you have nothing to bargain with. If you don't comply, then you are surely dead. You can hear Felipe shout in protest. He'd be willing to sacrifice his own life to make sure the sceptre doesn't fall into the wrong hands. Oh Felipe...always more bravery than brains.

You affix the sceptre to the trapeze and his men begin to pull it up.
""See you in hell,"" Hannigan sneers as he cuts the rope.

You leap onto the trapeze and begin to swing. The men holding it slide along the ground and struggle to keep you up., knowing that they'll lose the sceptre if they let go. Hannigan draws a pistol and begins shooting. BAM! BAM! BAM!

Bullets whiz by your face. You go into a birdcage and flip under the bullets. After 6 shots, he runs out of ammo and throws his gun at you. You easily dodge and focus your momentum to swing up to the opening. You land on solid ground and turn to your attackers, anger welling within your chest.

Hannigan and his men flee. They know they are no match for you.


Now aren't you glad you went to Philadelphia School of Circus Arts?

Treasure hunting is just one of the many practical fields that will utilize the lessons you learn from this school. I've taken the intro to aerials class and I'm seriously considering signing up for one of the more extensive weekly courses. It is a good workout and you learn a skill set that may come in handy one day. The intro class also makes for a fun, unique date idea if you are at that comfort level in the relationship(seriously it was like couples' night when I went). The instructors are very polite and professional.

So yeah, bottom line - good workout and unique fun.",2011-03-08 16:04:39
dgeHi1-ur-tpINGuRosoCg,9UZlB3fHVe2JBvPw4kRb5g,WutPKleHX3uyKom4xcDE8w,5.0,2,2,2,"So I was perusing the paper during lunch a while back when something in the 'food brief' section caught my eye. A food and beverage museum was opening and having a party. Of course, how could New Orleans NOT have food and drink museum? 

I've attended some pretty swanky parties and some cheap parties, but let me tell you, I think this was some of the best money I have ever spent. Ever. For the miniscule price of $ 60/person, some foodie friends and I attended the opening gala of the Southern Food and Beverage Museum (SOFAB for short). There is nothing finer than hob-nobbing with 27 of NOLA's finest chefs, sampling their signature dishes and consuming unlimited libations. This was off the hook, and don't even get me started about the 'to-go' bags of cracklin'. 

SOFAB is located in the Riverwalk Mall along the mighty Mississippi River and is also conveniently situated at the upriver end of the mall next to the food court. Small by modern museum standards, SOFAB has several rooms (I didn't try to notice if there was a theme in each of them) and in each room were tables and tables of food and drinks. Some of the chefs I spoke to include: Paul Prudhomme (K-Paul's), Tory McPhail (Commander's Palace), Ken Smith (Upperline), Donald Link (Cochon/Herbsaint), and many others including my boy Matt at 7 on Fulton. Everything I had was perfect (and this was before the mint juleps kicked in)! Thankfully, they had printed programs so one could keep track of the parallel universe I just shifted into. Here's what I ate that put me in a 'degustatory rapture':

- Acadiana; Chef Jeff Tunks (restaurant is in D.C.)
Deviled Eggs with Crabmeat Ravigote & LA Chopique Caviar
5 stars - OMG!!! This was so succulent!

- Arnaud's Restaurant; Chef Mike Ragua
Shrimp Arnaud

Oysters Poached in Horseradish Cream with Crispy Bacon
5 stars - Heaven...oysters and bacon...probably my favorite!

- Cochon Restaurant; Chefs Donlad Link and Stephen Stryjewski
Smothered Pig Cheeks over Grits
5 starts - love anything pig! Especially with grits!!!

- Commander's Palace; Chef Tory McPhail
Forever Smoked Pork, over Honey Roasted Ruston Peaches, Pickled Watermelon Rind & Souther Comfort BBQ Sauce

Regina's Butter Biscuits with Smoked Ham & Peach Chutney
4 stars

- Upperline Restaurant; Chef Ken Smith
Duck Etoufee with Jalapeno Cornbread & Louisiana Pepper Jelly
5 stars - ahh yeah, baby! 


Let me just say that I am a huge fan of all the finer dining establishments realizing how good  grits are and that grits go well with just about anything! Geaux grits! The food was amazing but also being served were signature drinks from a couple of restaurants:

Arnaud's: The French 75 (the most popular drink of the evening)
Caf Adelaide: The Sazerac, The Brandy Milk Punch
Pere Marquette: The Mint Julep (my personal favorite)
Also served: Abita beers and blueberry wines. And water. 

The food was so good that I was done after barely an hour. I brought my A-game appetite to this shindig and left with a gloriously happy belly and a slight buzz from the super good Mint Juleps. 
Gawd, I hope they have an opening gala every year!",2008-06-21 14:18:42

From reading the reviews, sounds like a lot of people are bringing up the same beefs - 'room wasn't the nicest', 'hotel was too loud' and so on - you get what you pay for and those guests paying top dollar for their rooms usually get the most deluxe ones and those guests who stay with Starwood the most often (oh hello, loyalty program), are the ones who get upgraded. It's just the hard truth. And in regards to the noise - well, it's a fact that peeps come to NOLA to party and there's just no getting around that. I've stayed at hotels in the Quarter where the street noise from Bourbon will waft into your room well into the hours approaching dawn, but I did not find that to be the case at this property. The location is right on the edge of the Quarter without sitting smack dab in it... I'm not exaggerating when I say I slept like a baby.

The panoramic views from the 11th floor lobby and lounge probably rival some of the best in the city... it's a stunning postcard capturing the enormity of the majestic Mississippi River and the venerable cityscape. Grab a drink, sink into a couch and let the world go by for a few minutes, or an hour!

While the view from my 14th floor room wasn't much to brag about, it was a pretty sweet suite (full disclosure: I am a Starwood Platinum). The upgrade came courtesy of the affable and disarmingly handsome Volker - I was trying to get into my room quickly with a conference call creeping up and Volker made sure I was on my way within mere minutes. 

The hotel connects to The Shops at Canal Place, which houses upscale stores such as department store anchor Saks, Anthropologie, BCBG and Michael Kors. I even had my hair done at the Aveda salon after getting blasted by the rain. The only annoying thing about this property? The elevator situation - you have to take an elevator to 11 to get to the lobby and then transfer to a separate elevator to access the guest rooms. Not terribly inconvenient considering all the good that's going on here, but worth a mention. 

The weekend I was in, rates were available via Starwood's website for $119 (I booked about a month in advance). My advise? Take the deal and run! Doesn't get too much better than the Westin in this range.",2012-08-23 01:44:37
NET9IM2mjb5i3EzPzwzPXw,ELktnffdqgtgMBYf9_AaWg,Ouiw1DmBI-CFd2FEvC0jow,1.0,3,0,0,"I rented a vehicle from Advantage Rent A Car at the Tampa airport in January, because they had the most reasonable prices and availability.  However, this location has a deceitful business practice and they should be held accountable for it - which is where this review will contribute.

I arrived at their location to complete the paperwork to pick up a vehicle, and was assisted by a Manager by the name of Gregory.  Gregory attempted to up-sell me their electronic toll pass for $9.95 a day.  I explained that I would only be traveling on the highways 2 times during my visit to Florida and therefore did not need a pass, and would just stop at the toll to pay cash.  Gregory then asserted that ""most"" of the toll highways in Florida don't allow you to pay cash, and that if you go through without an electronic toll pass the driver will be ticketed several hundreds of dollars per instance (of going through the toll booth).  He wove a story of a customer who had recently done that and was now going to court to try and fight over a thousand dollars worth of fees, etc, etc.  

I then asked him specifically whether or not highway 80 in Florida allows drivers to stop and pay cash, and he confidently said ""no"".  This just didn't seem right to me, so I told him that in that case I would just program my GPS to avoid toll roads, which would take care of the situation.  He was hesitant, and said I could try that, but ""it might be difficult"" - he continued to try and sell me the toll pass but I declined.

I then went down a level in the parking garage to where you pick up the actual vehicle.  There was a friendly employee there, and I decided to be bold, and with a smile on my face, I said, ""So, I'm hoping you can tell me the truth - is it really correct that you can't pay cash at most of the toll plazas in Florida?""  The young man exclaimed out loud incredulously and asked if that was what I had been told (I said yes).  He then continued to say how frustrated he was and how bad he felt for their customers, because management told the employees to lie to customers and tell them that you can't pay cash at tolls, so that the customers will buy the expensive daily fee electronic toll passes.  He says he hates it, and I don't blame him.  That's a lousy business practice - and fraudulent as well.

HOWEVER - this is what takes the cake - I just saw a charge on my credit card statement, 3 weeks after my weekend in Florida - from Advantage Rent A Car for $27.  I called the customer service number and was told it was because I had been reported as going through a toll without paying (and without an electronic pass).  This of course is absolutely false - I drove on a toll highway 2 times and both times stopped very easily and paid the (very small) toll fee - IN CASH.  I've already disputed the charge with my credit card company and they've removed it from my statement. 

I wish there was some way that Advantage could be subjected to a penalty or some other negative repercussion for this terrible behavior.  I'll also be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau.  But figured a review exposing the terrible behavior was at least worth my time as well.",2019-02-18 22:32:29

The building installed dog turf on 1st avenue. In theory this was an amazing idea however they building does not clean it and it is covered in feces. Several dogs in the building have become extremely ill and their vets have said it is because of the bacteria on the turf and not to let the dogs use it because it is not properly cleaned. 

The garbage chute backs up every weekend and garbage overflows into the garbage chute room on many of the floors. See photos. The smell in the hallways is sometimes unbearable from the smell of trash. We have been getting more bugs in our apartment now because of it.   This has been going on for months and I've complained multiple times. The last time I called I was told they were doing the best they could. 

In order to have maintenance fix anything in your apartment you have to put in a request online. My last three requests have gone unanswered for almost 2 months. I went to the leasing office multiple times as well as stopped the maintenance people in the hallway and it still took that long to be acknowledged. 

Last weekend the building sprung a new charge on us for cooling the common areas of the building. The leasing manager said there was an addendum in the lease. Many residents along with myself have a lease that does not have that addendum therefore legally we don't have to pay it. I was told today they are consulting with their legal team and I have to pay it or I'll receive a late fee. I am not able to pay it through our app. I emailed the leasing manager a week ago to ask how to pay it and no response. I'd expect the legal team to take months to give us an answer just like everything else. 

The mail room has a new fob system because many residents were finding their packages stollen. Now UPS and FedEx is having difficulty getting into the building after the leasing office business hours. Last week UPS dropped all the packages off on 1st Ave because they couldn't get in the building because the building won't give them fobs. 

20% of the people in this building wear masks so it feels very unsafe. 

The bottom line is there are A LOT of issues in this building.  I thought they would have figured this all out by now but they haven't.  It is becoming more and more disappointing.",2021-01-14 16:54:24

First tried to call in to place an order for delivery, but was told we would need to go online to Delivery.com in order to place our order. Placed order online and it was noted that it would take 1 hour and 45 minutes, which was long but understandable (they're very busy). After about an hour, I got a notification that the order was on its way. An hour after that, the pizza hadn't arrived. We live about 5 minutes or less from Guido's. We tried calling Guido's and were told that they had no control over the delivery, and that if we wanted to re-order our pizza, we'd have to pay a second time. We even offered to pick it up ourselves and were told we'd have to pay again. Called Delivery.com and got the runaround. They said that the driver was 6 minutes away, and didn't offer any sort of compensation for the hassle except $5 off a future order. The driver was not 6 minutes away, he hadn't even picked up the order. Our driver ended up calling us and explained that he hit the wrong button and order wasn't ready, but that he was going to go pick it up now. Called Guido's who said that the pizza had been sitting there for almost an hour and that it was ""100% the driver's fault"". Keep in mind that we offered to pick up the pizza ourselves, and they had told us they'd have to remake it and charge us twice. Asked to talk to a manager who told me ""I just make pies"" and that they have no control over the delivery process. I tried to reason and say that while they might be doing the deliveries, they have chosen to exclusively partner with Delivery.com who did a poor job. Again, instead of trying to offer any compensation she just said ""sorry, there's nothing we can do"". I would've taken any sort of effort to help make this right, but got nothing. Pizza arrived cold and Delivery.com said they'd escalate this to the next level in order to process a refund, and that I would be contacted in 48 hours. That was 72 hours ago, and still haven't heard anything from them. Sorry Guido's, as I said over the phone, I won't be able to order from here again or recommend your restaurant.",2020-09-29 23:18:12

I have two undergraduate depress from exceptional school, one in a consortium with U Penn. Those two previous schools were excellent in the treatment of students, teaching, provided health services, advising, and on and on. U.Penn. fails students, at least graduate nursing students, horribly. Just look at the suicide rate. Also, this past year the new head of the mental health center killed himself after working here just 8 months I believe. He had come from Cornell, a notoriously depressing place. Penn is a dangerous cruel environment that you should avoid if you care about your sanity or education at all. 
I tried to contact my advisor when I started here. She didn't respond for over six months. I finally went to the general student adviser, but sadly she quit. The advisors I had, and there were multiple, were selfish, unhelpful, and generally failing their advisees. Penn does little to help the student or guide them. I had to jump through a large number of hoops for the graduate nursing program and Penn did nothing to make this easier for the students. There was no advisor guidance, paper instructions, nothing to help make it easier. 
We were required to provide health records, but Penn didn't accept mine for some reason even though my prior employer (a hospital) accepted and provided them. They wanted to re-vaccinate me for literally everything. 
Getting licensed in NJ and DE is not easy and Penn doesn't help you. 
They don't bring in someone to do flu shots for the nursing student or give step by step instructions on where to go to fulfill the licensing procedures. I found that the advisor really only cares about doing his or her own research, teaching is a distant second, and helping students comes last if at all. 
When I started there they said they wanted us to succeed and they would do everything they could to help us do that. That's a blatant lie. If you send an e-mail with multiple questions, I know from experience you will either get a response to only one of your questions or get turfed off to someone else to answer you.  If you need extra help in a class and ask the professor where to find someone to tutor you, they either don't know or send you to someone who is tutoring 15 other people at the same time and only shows up about 3 out of 8 sessions because he or she is busy too.

However, this time I was impressed with myself in addition to the fine folks at Board and Brush! I'm fairly creative but it's more in writing and ideas, thinking outside the box kind of stuff! But apparently I'm pretty good at summoning something awesome from the depth of my inner creative cat! 

If you've ever been to a paint and sip and even remotely enjoyed it you definitely have to give this place a visit! It's a little less structured than a paint and sip but I definitely enjoyed it a lot more because of that. The instructors give you all the steps of what you're going to be doing at the beginning and then it's up to you to work through it all at your own pace. I really loved that aspect because paint and sips make me feel a bit rushed. While here I got to really put the finishing touches on a couple of the steps I wanted to turn out well. 

When you sign up you get to choose your design that way they can have your wood and stencils ready for you when you show up. After the instructions are laid out they lets you go crazy banging, scraping, clawing and generally going to town on your wood to stress it and make it look like it's been through some stuff with you. After that you move on to staining and washing it so you can give it that perfect finish to match your sweet interior or exterior of wherever you have in mind for hanging it up. Once that happens you get to see how surgeon like your skills of placing your stencil down is.(this was the only part people seemed to have a bit of trouble with. But through teamwork and perseverance we got through it!) After that it's time to bring out your inner Bob Ross and get creative with coloring. Once your done designing your dream sign you rip the stencil off like a bandaid and proceed to pick your jaw off the floor because you just made awesome happen! Once that's done a little finishing wax is added and then they add some mounting supplies to the back and you're out the door like the newborn rockstar that you are. 

Ashley and her crew of kids that she has working for her are really a fantastic bunch. They all have great ideas to help you achieve the perfection you might not even know you were capable of. I have to give a huge shoutout to Bella, she was an excellent tour guide through the land of possibilities I had in front of me. Together she helped me make probably the sweetest and most patriotic rendition of a rooster that place has ever seen! (Okay maybe I'm a little biased! But Ashley didn't help by telling me it was one of the coolest signs she's seen since they opened!) i had loads of fun and I definitely plan on coming back to make something else that I'll surely be proud to hang on my walls!",2018-07-21 07:20:19

Explained that they were non commission and just wanted to make sure we got great flooring for a great price. After discussing our price range he was slightly less personable, but based on the shopping around we had done we were not going to spend 6,000 on carpet for two spare bedrooms. He brought in a few samples that were not impressive and the color options were not what we were looking for. We tried to explain nicely that we weren't interested in what we had been shown and if the samples we saw were our only option we were not interested in ordering flooring. 

This is where Dr.Jekyll became Mr.Hyde! He was rude and abrasive, talking down to my husband and I as if we were idiots. He kept saying he didn't understand what we wanted and no matter how we tried to explain it he just kept repeating that he didn't understand. He was sharp and continued to be incredibly abrasive for the next few minutes. I tried explaining that while durability is obviously important so is aesthetic and we had not seen anything we loved. He went back to his car in a huff to find more samples and made us feel like we didn't know what we were talking about. I tried explaining a second time that for most of us aesthetic is just as important as durability, it can last 40 years but if it doesn't look nice it isn't worth the money in our opinion. He said we had to agree to disagree because he is a carpet guy and knows better. Infuriating! 

After showing us a few more samples in colors that were not right for our space we declined to work with him and he left. Horrible experience and impression. He was so disrespectful, in front of my son no less, that I'm not sure I would have done business with him even if he had found our dream carpeting. Highly suggest looking elsewhere!

We ended up ordering carpet today from someone else that we fell in love with for its aesthetic and durability for half the price! 

Update: Although I can appreciate that my review got a response (over a year after it was originally posted) I am a little bit appalled that the response was not used to make the situation right in any way or to be apologetic for the terrible experience but was instead used to toot their own horn. Don't use your response as an ad, use it to address my experience! Not surprisingly I think my initial review is a great example of how this company works based on this recent response.",2019-04-16 05:42:35
vyWve3JxqNLGOGgJgYhInw,onQsolCnpHwtOZCIuI91vQ,k_675V0foqpdXfBZW7pgOA,5.0,3,2,2,"I had a great experience today at mthai. I came in around 3 (during a normal lull) and was alone. The server turned out to be the chef/owner and I loved her. She was sweet and charming and an excellent cook. 

I was even a bit annoying because I came in with a groupon and wanted to try to get some type of deal worked out for maybe a combo-ish type plate. I didn't succeed, and I don't really blame them lol but I had to try. Thai doesn't heat up that well so i wanted to be unrealistic and try to create a sort of tasting menu lol. Luckily the chef owner answered my questions and didn't look stunned when I ordered so much food. I also ordered Tom yum soup along with the house soup that comes with the meal lol. I wanted to try it! 

This is when I realized the server was also the chef, saw her working away behind the counter and I liked that when I stood I could see the big wok and all the dirty work being done ;) 

The house soup, simple as could be but pretty damn tasty. Almost clear, but flavorful broth, couple cubed carrots, couple sprigs cilantro and fried wonton wrapper with some seasoning. I wasn't prepared for something so plain looking to have a flavor punch. I liked the cup size, perfect amount and the wonton was still crunchy on the inside. How does that happen? I just wrote a big paragraph on the cup of soup LOL. 

Next came my big pot of Tom yum. I told her not too spicy as I like the sour taste a lot. It was up there, but not my favorite style of tom yum. I'm not sure if the way I like it is more Americanized and possible a tamarind paste is used vs. real stock. I like the sour more prominent but this soup still makes my tummy smile. I also noticed fresh mushrooms here like at fresh creations, I think that's also more authentic than canned straw (but I do prefer the straw mushrooms still). 

The drunken noodle came out next, DELICIOUS, contrary to other reviewers, my noodles were perfect, the sweet heat was just right and the chicken was not dry.  I crave that smell and sweet burn of the drunken noodles. 

It was a little awhile but I got the pad Thai and bean thread noodles together. By this time a helper started helping. Who was friendly enough. The pad Thai was different in that it had round noodles instead of flat ones like you typically see. Also a lemon vs. a lime was served with it. The shrimps were huge and cleaned well, and not overdone. I liked the small fried tofu pieces too, similar to Bangkok. I enjoyed the different noodle style too. I don't think it detracted from the overall dish. 

By this time I only had one bite of bean thread noodle. It was good but I was stuffed and couldn't appreciate the flavors anymore haha. 

This was when I asked if the lady cooking was the owner and I got to chat a bit with her. She was born in Thailand and has lived in Reno for 12 years. We shared some fun stories and we discussed the pros and cons of groupon. So we have another, what seems like, it could be authentic Thai cook and restaurant in Reno. I also asked her how to reheat leftovers and so she gave me some tips I haven't tried so I'm hoping that they turn out alright. 

Unfortunately, this is a little more out of my way so I would have to really make and effort to come here, but after my experience today, my favorite spot (sawseedee) has some competition. I think people should give it a try. I didn't get any appetizers or larb or curry though so I can't comment on those main dishes of Thai cuisine. Also the portions could probably be considered a little small, but the plates are pretty big too. The prices seemed on point, $9 for chicken, $11 for shrimp, seafood combo was up there at $17 though, but I imagine its good quality judging from the shrimp I had. 

Also, each plate had a slice of orange which I always like after for palate and mouth refreshing after heavy carbs haha

TL;DR My point is, I say try it. I enjoyed the talk with the chef/owner (important that she didn't seem... desperate,I guess) and my food very much. 

I'll probably be bringing my dad to try it out next time he's in town.",2013-07-16 00:33:45

I was approved thru my credit union at a lower rate than what Carvana offered and my credit union mailed me my check. Carvana sold the vehicle while I was processing my purchase and I ended up buying another truck locally at a dealer. On Black Friday I tried to give them another chance and tried to purchase a Volkswagen Jetta Sportwagen for my son. I filled out all the bank info with a $2000 deposit and the balance $12000 would come from my credit union. I signed all the paperwork online and scheduled a delivery date for 2 weeks later. 3 days after my online purchase, I kept getting texts stating that I would lose the $1000 Black Friday discount if they didn't have a copy of my check from the credit union sent over to them by 8pm that evening. I had already provided Carvana with my credit union information, account, as well as authorized them to verify my fund for both the deposit and the balance. They stated some bogus ""guideline in underwriting,"" that this wasn't enough. So I said no problem, in the morning, we can get on a 3 way call and speak to both my bank and my credit union and they can provide verification. They said unfortunately, the price would go up $1000 if this was the case as there was an expiration date on the black Friday discount. I even offered, a screen shot of my credit union account, showing my loan was already funded via a check and my first payment was due in January, but they still said this was not acceptable. It seems they make it hard for you to complete a transaction with a discount and wanted to revert back to a no discount transaction stating there was not enough time to verify funds (really? I didn't set up delivery for 2 weeks exactly because I knew it would take time for my credit union to mail me a check). Their customer service rep Ally escalated the conversation to TJ her ""manager"" who was very smug and thought that when he strutted his ""manager"" title I would be impressed. I explained that I was buying from Carvana for the ""convenience and hassle free process they claim to have"" but yet will not hold a car even with a $2000 deposit for more than 24 hours unless you finance though them and since you are using a ""3rd party"" credit union (that has much lower rates than them for folks with great credit), their guidelines were different. To me it was simply a bait and switch, ""buy at this price one day but the price will change a few days later after they had extracted all your personal financial information. Never again. I requested they cancel my order. Their prices are the same as car dealerships and as much as some folks think dealerships are tough to deal with, Carvana employs people who know nothing about customer service. There is no advantage in buying from them than from a dealership. In fact I would much rather deal with real people whom I can evaluate if they are trustworthy and be able to choose to do business with them or not. The fact that they are an internet dealership only empowers them to hide in anonymity when they try to treat you unscrupulously. Do yourself a favor buy your next vehicle the old fashioned way, find someone who you can meet in person and trust. Buying a car are stressful to some, Carvana will only make you more stressful and offer no advantage in pricing or service. If this is how you are treated when you are trying to buy a vehicle from them, imagine what will happen if there is a problem with your car/truck! Poor service in the beginning will translate to worse service when you need it. I hope you read all the other negative reviews on Yelp and other rating sites and see Carvana for what it really is.",2018-11-29 05:31:03
Ef8LhCdLoOcyuHWHCCVjdA,CXY-xLAGI0kwGLesaK5agw,lV6w971tAAOx8Q_Xfa_bPw,1.0,0,2,0,"Italian Bistro?... far from it. 
    My family, friends, and neighbors have been coming to Bria for years now because it's one of the nicest place to eat in Bellevue. Sadly, it has been declining rapidly for the last couple of years now and I now I want to speak up. I can see the prospect that it has something to do with new ownership/ management because it's what everyone usually talks about when I am in there. Regulars are not pleased. They are losing customers to a number of reasons that I can hear just by word of mouth. First of all...they call themselves a Italian Bistro? Where is the authenticity on the menu? The last time I dined there.. they ran out of basically all the type of fish they sell. FISH! Good luck to them with it becomes Lent and everyone walks out on all the Friday nights when they run out of fish!!! I have also been told their cheese is sometimes moldy tasting and their olive oil bland. THIS IS AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT... those are the two most important ingredients. They should figure out how to order the right amount (and fresh) food instead of hosting these cheap ""kids eat for free nights""... even though there is no kids menu....

Also, one of the most important elements of an Italian Restaurant or better yet, Italian Culture is the WINE. ALL my family and friends go into Bria thinking they are going to have a nice, relaxing evening and enjoy their favorite wine (or better yet, just tasteful glass) and they always end up disappointed with the selections because they are ""always out of something"" when the owners don't seem to care to have actually good wine. Do they even drink wine? Why cheap out on the one of the most important elements to a good dinner at an Italian restaurant. 

Bria has all the tools to be great (again) maybe have owners that care and better menu items that look and taste good. They should be focusing on the simple things that can make a place like that succeed and yet they ignore every negative reviews and comments that come from the locals and regulars. It saddens me to see this place start failing once again especially when it has people there who do seem to care.. The cooks and the bartender all seem to work their butts off and they get embarrassed when its the owners and the managers who are ruining this place. 

We need this place to do well. It's Bellevue gem. It's where many people have been coming to for years to enjoy and GOOD MEAL, PEOPLE, & A GLASS (or two) OF WINE!!!!!!!

P.S The parking sucks and they really should open the patio up... and allow dogs to chill out there on hot summer nights... should be more neighborhood friendly.",2020-02-04 18:06:03
5SPXkHkZjMsk6ZcBR6Vy9w,9cW7C7TvDST3bJkEVTo-Bg,gWiLMICKe655Xrs_RpxS2Q,1.0,12,1,0,"Wow. That's really all I can say. Let me start off by saying the experience you will read below happened two days ago. I wanted to give myself time to cool down before writing this review, but I'm still angry and that says something. 

I have been to this salon for laser hair removal treatments 5 times now. The first two with Amber were great. She is great and I have nothing but wonderful things to say about her. If you must go here, go to her and only her. The next two times were with a technician I will not name out of respect for her. This unnamed tech is a very nice person but I have not been satisfied with her as a laser hair removal tech. She left a lot of my hair long before lasering (you are supposed to shave the area to be lasered, but I was doing hands and armpits and face and forgot to. They have a razor there and will shave you if you forget; unnamed tech did not). She was also too quick and not as thorough as Amber, missing several spots. (I got my hands treated but unnamed tech only did my fingers. She also missed the pit of my armpit, and did not go high enough on my beard area.) Like I said, nice person, not a stellar laser hair removal tech. 

And then there was my last appointment with Joan, the head of the department. My experience with Joan is the sole reason I will never step foot in this salon again. Joan is the head of the laser department, and my goodness, does she need some customer service training. At the beginning of the appointment, she asked how I was doing with my treatments. I was honest and told her Amber had been great, the unnamed tech had been less than great. Joan immediately put up a defensive front and did not want to hear any of my concerns. Any thing I said was met with an excuse and an eye roll. I had concerns with all three areas I was getting treated, but Joan did not want to hear them, instead cutting me off and telling me ""well I can comp you a hand treatment."" I told her the hands were the least of my concerns. She stated that's all I told her I had issues with. That was a lie. So I re-iterated my concerns. In the end she told me she'd comp me a face treatment (but when I walked out of the salon, I didn't hear another word about that, and honestly, I just wanted to get out of that salon, I didn't even ask). 

After that initial conversation, Joan began my laser treatment. She started lasering my face. If you've never had a laser hair treatment before, it hurts. It feels like rubber bands quickly snapping on your skin. Understandably, after a while, your skin gets numb. After a few quick zaps to my face, I asked Joan where on my face she was pointing the laser. She touched my face and said ""here."" I told her I couldn't feel that and asked for a handheld mirror. In the nastiest tone ever, she responds ""well I don't have one in here. You could stand up"" (to walk over to the mirror across the room. (interestingly Amber had given me a handheld mirror before to view my results!!) If I hadn't prepaid the session, I swear I would have gotten up and walked out. I have never been treated so poorly by someone in the customer service business (expect maybe for the AT&T guys... but don't get me started on that) and this chick is the HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT. I am astounded. And pissed off for that matter. Like I said earlier, if you must go here, go to Amber. Do not go to Joan, not if you want to feel respected as a customer.",2018-05-23 03:09:49
NGHC3ziOllDDt9QsO-sO9g,Xt7XeQfExXpSzWYXmB7RzA,85yx4a7CRJAQXkID6pWacA,1.0,4,0,0,"Don't stay here. I had rather high expectations for this hotel but it did not meet any of them. While it's ok clean, it is not a luxury hotel. And don't bring kids here, just don't don't do it. The pool is bigger than most  hotels but much smaller than a luxury hotel's pool. The pool area is extreme plain and drab and if you have small children, 5-9 yrs old, they can only stand in the first 3 ft of the pool as it gets too deep very quickly. The attendant would not allow the kids to jump into the pool although it's not posted anywhere. The attendant will just tell them to stop jumping. I understand no diving, but i don't understand no jumping. Another guest with four children, was as confused as I was on that one. We were the only two families in the pool area, couldn't have been disturbing anyone yet the kids were not allowed to jump off the side of the pool, into the pool. 

Although the rooms are two rooms divided by a door and decently spacious, the bathroom is by far the smallest bathroom I've ever seen in a hotel. You can be sitting on the toilet and reach the doorknob to open the door. The lighting is horrendous. Two lights over the vanity, nothing in the shower.  Also missing is the fan to take the moisture that builds up quickly in this tiny bathroom. The shower head is pathetic also. I've had much better bathrooms at the Holiday Inn Express or many other hotels. 

Although the room is made to accommodate 6, with 2 double beds and a sofa sleeper, they don't provide enough towels, pillows or blankets and when you call for them, they say they will bring them but don't. Had to call again the next day. Housekeeping never came to tidy up the room. 

The front desk was courteous upon check-in. (That might be the only friendly person we met there.) Management was unavailable to take a phone call from me at 7pm and the voicemail that I left about a few concerns went unreturned. 

Paint chipping, wallpaper pulling up, and stained furniture were all present in our room. 

Lastly, they actually charge $50 deposit to your card per night for incidentals and it's not put back on your card until 10-14 days later. I've heard of authorizing your card but I've never seen an actual charge happen at a hotel. 

If you're wanting to stay here to gamble, then buck up a little more and stay at The Four Seasons which is connected to the casino and is truly a luxury hotel or go to the Ameristar in St Charles.  There are lots of really nice options for hotels in St Louis, unfortunately this is not one of them.",2015-11-03 04:08:48
F3WRukK-6CxYhtOSIZ2spA,gjHaQRWxdTIPoBfvW-JAgQ,4kei3JfQLLhDtxpxaIkkkQ,1.0,13,3,0,"This is the WORST spa I've ever been to.  

Why?  

OVERPRICED.  I booked massage treatments for myself and 3 of my friends while we were in Phoenix for a wedding a couple of months ago.  First of all, Red Door charges premium prices-- as high as salons that I've visited in Beverly Hills, NY and SF, even though other things in Phoenix, such as Westin La Paloma rooms, are remarkably inexpensive.  But I realized that the Red Door spas are a national chain with a high-end rep, so I hoped that the top notch price would translate to top notch service and meant this was going to be one of the best spas in town.  We're all professionals who work long hours and were looking forward to a nice, relaxing weekend.

POOR SERVICE.  Due to some delay in getting our bill paid at brunch, we were about 5 minutes late, and by the time we got to our respective massage rooms, we were about 10 minutes late.  All but one of our therapists basically reprimanded us for being late, and told us that she would just have to skip certain parts of our bodies to compensate for the lost time.  We had already apologized for being late, and being treated like children and still forced to pay full price for 80% of the massage was unprofessional and not very nice, but ok, fine.  Just give me a good massage, and all will be good in my world.

NO SKILL.  But unfortunately, it turned out that each of our massages were totally forgettable and not relaxing.  We discussed our respective treatments after we met in the locker room afterwards and discovered that we'd each had the same experience - totally mediocre and disappointing.  Knots were all still there.  The masseuses just went through rote motions rather than customizing pressure and technique to respond to the tense areas in our bodies.  We each got different kinds of massages too, but the results were all the same.  So once again, we were disappointed.  

RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL.  We thought that perhaps we should get another treatment.  One of my friends had seen a coupon on the Westin La Paloma's website advertising 50% off another spa service if you booked two.  So we asked one of our masseuses whether we could do this.  She seemed to think this would be fine, so she went to get a manager to see who was available to give us additional treatments.  This manager was *shockingly* condescending..!  First she told us the discount only applied for two services for the same person.  For some reason, it almost seemed like she was convincing us that we couldn't afford it.  Ok sure, no problem, we said.  We were each interested in adding on another treatment.  Then she told us that we needed the actual coupon to be printed from the website.  She refused to let us print it down from the front desk, and when we thought we would just have one person leave and print it out, she said she needed one printout for each of us. !!  Now that's just getting unreasonable.  Also, when we checked the website discount later, nowhere did it say you needed to bring some kind of printout with you...!!

DIRTY AND UNDERSTAFFED.  Annoyed, we hoped to use the steam room afterwards to try and relax and make the most of the facilities.  A couple of important things to note at this point in our experience - 

1.  the steam room smelled like the plastic slippers (dirty ones, no less).  We wanted to use cucumber slices over our eyes, but there were only three slices.  So being friends, we split them and used them on one eye each!  In the half hour or more that we were using the steam room, no one ever came to provide fresh face towels (those ran out too) or cucumbers.  Now, I have to also speak out on this too - in all seriousness and honesty, this was truly the most neglected spa facility I've ever been to.  See #2 below.

2.  There was NO MORE DRINKING WATER anywhere.  After some time in the steam room, we were hot and thirsty.  The one pitcher in the waiting room had been empty since we all left for our treatments almost 2 hours earlier.  As we're used to very good service at spas, we kept expecting someone to refill it.  The used glasses we had left from the time we were in the waiting room were still there, untouched.  And yes, still dirty.  After a while, we hoped we could just ask a staffperson to refill it.  But without going outside to the reception area in  our towels, we couldn't locate a staffperson!  Dragon lady / manager had been the last person to ""help"" us before we paid our bill.

RIP OFF / DISHONEST.  When we went to pay our bill, they automatically included a full 20% tip in the bill!!  Considering the horrible experience, that was *extremely* presumptious.  In a service industry, you don't include service charge unless you explicitly indicate beforehand that you will be doing this.  Total ripoff.

I have no reason to lie to you.  Go if you don't mind flushing your money and time down the toilet.",2007-08-14 22:50:29
Bvu1XDU0T-wEqgSRSjZVRw,xGS_mlHcCUipSKXrHk6CGw,G5jxVV_AIHCquF0B3PqYRw,4.0,1,0,1,"I've wanted to come to Ernest's for a while, but it seemed like every time I thought of going it was during the summer when the school is closed (or at least when the culinary program running the restaurant is on vacation). 

I arrived at NAIT from the train. The Culinary part of NAIT, including Ernest's is a bit of a walk from the station, but you can go inside the school and not have to worry about the weather (it was raining outside so that was nice). It was a bit confusing trying to find the restaurant from this way (I'd also never been to NAIT before), but after going through the market foodcourt part the restaurant was there, if a little tucked away. If it helps the restaurant is in Building U Room 121 (U121). 

Ernest's looks at functions just like a real function, except it's run by the Culinary Arts Program at NAIT. The hostess greeted me and asked for my reservation, which I made online at Open Table. She wasn't able to find it, but it was early in the day and I got seated quickly. 

The waitress who took care of me was very friendly. Ernest's has a small menu, with a few drinks, appetizers, main courses, and desserts. The menu is what some might consider high end, but the prices are actually very reasonable. Appetizers and desserts were around $6-$8 each and the main courses were $12-$15. For lunch that's really nice. 

I didn't order a drink or an appetizer even though they looked amazing (especially that rhubarb smash). The waitress brought out some bread and butter, just a couple of small slices, but they were delicious. Maybe I'm crazy, I want to say I tasted the slightest hint of lemon in the bread. It might have not been lemon, but there was just a little bit of brightness in the bread, which was delicious. 

The main course I got was The Country Style Fried Chicken. It comes on top of a truffled coleslaw, corn relish, and spicy chestnut honey. I took a small spoonful of the relish, which was delicious and sweet. Then I went to cut into one of the three pieces of chicken and noticed it was pink inside, with obvious blood. A slightly raw steak that's okay, raw chicken is not. 

I think the mark of a good restaurant isn't necessarily whether or not it's perfect 100% of the time, but what the restaurant does when a problem arises. Bloody chicken is a problem, and when I flagged down the waitress and pointed out the issue she was quick to apologize and took the dish back to the kitchen to have it fixed. She was very nice and apologized again letting me know that I would get a comped dessert. 

After several minutes the dish came back, and I checked the chicken and everything was cooked fine. The dish was delicious, a fantastic combination of sweet and little spicy. The chicken was crispy and not at all greasy. 

About halfway through my meal someone else, an instructor perhaps, came to check on my meal and make sure everything from before was resolved. She then said the entire meal would be comped. I really didn't feel that was necessary, the main course perhaps, but I think this mistake was an honest one. Definitely not a good one to make, but then again I'm sure other fine dining establishments have served an undercooked chicken dish at one point or another. 

I decide to get dessert, not because the entire meal was going to be comped, but because the desserts looked delicious. I got the milk chocolate mousse, which came with a chocolate cake chocolate cake, a port infused pear, and mandarin granite. It also came with several delicious fruit decorations (raspberries and a strawberry). This was delicious - I only wished I had a little knife or something because it was really hard getting the granite and cake on my spoon (it kept sliding off). 

During my dessert I was approached again by someone from the program, maybe another instructor, who apologized for the incident with the main course, and said that would be comped. I figured that would be fine. It wasn't the dessert that was the problem, and I'm really not the kind of person to insist on a comped meal because of a mistake (I've worked customer service jobs so I know that mistakes happen - we're all human).

I would like to give Ernest's 5 stars because the food was delicious, the service was fantastic, and the price and portions were great. However because of the mistake and because there was a little miscommunication between the people working (first comped dessert, then a comped meal, then a comped main course) I have to give Ernest's 4 stars. I did really enjoy my meal here, and I think it's fantastic the students in the Culinary Program get real restaurant experience and make some really tasty creations. They were very helpful and I look forward to trying Ernest's again, perhaps during one of their highly recommend Friday Buffets or during Dinner.",2015-09-16 02:31:53
eXSjIQ2QpRuhFWueUoJ3sA,bO_XH6Yi2TsdMKi2bNsEuw,sK5JtOZR9-xu7Ku9SXPi7A,2.0,2,5,1,"I normally don't write reviews unless there is something that stands out of the ordinary.  In this case, Broad Run the golf course is wonderfully maintained. Beautiful greens, nice and fast, that rolled true and held nicely helped lessen the annoyance of an extremely slow and poorly managed round and less than courteous employees.  The only employee that was very good was the starter.  A very nice and pleasant man, he was.  The rest of the people we encountered... not so much.

One of my biggest annoyances is when courses pair groups. If I wanted to play with strangers I would arrange that on my own. When I booked the tee time online, I specifically looked to see if they had a grouping policy and I either missed it or it is not specified on the website. It should be. At any rate when we arrived at the bag drop and were TOLD, not asked, TOLD that we were being paired I immediately was irritated. Then when I expressed my displeasure with the employee in the pro shop and asked not tot be paired with another twosome, I was told in a cavalier manner ""anyone who plays golf knows that groups will be paired.  We are a business....""  Blah, Blah, Blah.

I'm sorry, I didn't realize that it is my concern to worry about the business of Broad Run. I am there to golf and I am a paying customer.  I have been playing golf for over 40 years and have played many a twosome without being paired with another group at similar and better courses.  I guess I don't have enough experience according to the pro shop attendant.

So after we had to just swallow that we were to be paired and after we were herded to the first tee, like we were holding things up...we got the pleasure of seeing that there were 3 groups on the first hole, stacked up nicely as our tee time was delayed by about 15 or 20 minutes.  Yes that's right.  

We were on a schedule and when I planned the outing I gave us about 4 hours and 45 min for the round. (which is insane in itself) . Well, that wasn't enough.  We had to leave on the 16th tee.  Yep it took about 4.5 hours to get to the 16th tee.  Even though we saw what looked like a ranger driving around aimlessly with a scowl on his face a couple of times, he did nothing.  

So as we were driving back to the clubhouse we got to see the group on 17 green that obviously was the problem. After passing them we got the par 5, 18th.  To my disbelief there wasn't even one group on the entire hole!   What is the rangers job?  To drive around?  Get the course moving!

I think I have ranted enough. Great course but poorly managed at least from my perspective.  I think we should get a rebate considering I only was able to play 83% of my round.  Hopefully, this was an anomaly but it will be a while before I return there or recommend the course to others.",2015-09-23 15:21:26
ZAcMTNZ7MNjgnoXt5kYcyw,7cGgITMrGbUIYQMyMuOHWw,IOQzR_0fhpQgzWU0WUE1tA,1.0,5,0,0,"My husband and I had the WORST experience car shopping at this location. We have been driving what seems like all around Florida looking for a 4Runner or a Tacoma that is just right for us- miles, year, price- and we found a 4Runner at this location through the internet that seemed to be THE one. On the way to the dealership we read the CarFax report which stated that the car had been in two car accidents. Upon further reading we saw that the damages were less than $500 each time and decided to still test drive the vehicle. The sales woman who took care of us didn't even let us see the car before she took down ALL of our information and tried getting us to buy it... again, before we even saw the car! From the beginning we stated we were not buying a car today. Before we got to see the car, they asked us for the keys to our car for pricing the trade in. When we finally went to see it and test drive it, my husband who does auto body work for a living, noticed the extremely poor work the car had after it's accidents and we were immediately turned off. After the quick test drive we went back and began explaining that we weren't going to buy today. We still wanted to see what the numbers were going to be so we waited for the manager to finish those up. The whole time they kept pushing for us to buy it and we explained not once, not twice and not even just three times that we were not going to buy, we were still looking, and even explained the auto body damage was kind of a deal breaker. She went back to the office and brought out the manager and he was super aggressive even though we said multiple times we were not going to buy it and were just waiting for the numbers to see if it was even worth it. He was super rude to the point that my husband was starting to get defensive. They left and came back with the numbers which werent even good! They offered half of what other dealerships offered us for our car and when my husband said he would take the buyers order to review and speak with our bank they refused to let us take it!! ?? So again we explained we weren't going to buy period. Mind you the whole time they had our keys!! So we couldn't even leave! Finally after over an hour and a half of that game they decided to ask someone to go get our keys. We stood up and made our way to the door and to wait for our keys and the manager came out again and tried to get us to buy the car and when I finally spoke up and told him that the numbers weren't right, the car itself just wasn't the one either and it wasn't going to happen he was rude enough to make a comment about us wasting their time and that we shouldn't have come in if we were going to but that day! My husband was furious. I understand that this is how they make their living but they'll never be successful trying to bully people into buying vehicles! And holding our keys hostage for so long made us super uncomfortable! Awful selling tactics, it made them look so desperate for business. An experience that could've earned them a customer and that honestly should've taken less than 30 min turned into an hour and a half long hostile hostage situation. Run, don't walk away from this place.",2019-05-26 00:18:55

With a gastropub vibe and a chef who's already a foodie favorite, The Bridge Restaurant & Bar has a lot of competition in the ""upscale casual"" category. Easy and ample parking might be their ""ace in the hole"". 

The menu is organized by Finger, Spoon, Fork, and Knife, with an Express section for boxed lunches and salads. Although this approach follows a certain logic, it can be confusing to find dessert in with soups, sandwiches in with appetizers, and a hodge-podge of everything under ""Fork"" (seafood, salad, pasta, poutine, tartare, etc.). Knife encompasses the more expensive meat entrees (duck, chicken, lamb, beef). A separate menu of beer, wine, cocktails, and house-infused liquors includes Bar Bites (also printed on the back of the main menu). There's a lot to choose from.

We started with a Bloody Bridge cocktail ($7.43), sporting basil, housemade bloody mary mix, and bourbon. Usually termed a Bloody Belle or Bloody Derby, replacing vodka with bourbon makes for a sweeter flavor with less burn, but I'm not sure it's my thing. My wife (not much of a drinker) declared it the only Bloody Mary she's ever liked. Who knew that's all I had to do to get her to like both spicy cocktails and whiskey?

Blue Chips--hand-cut local russets tossed in gorgonzola and garlic fondue, balsamic reduction, cracked black pepper and green onions--were served warm with a side of evil ($9). On first taste I thought, ""This is too much going on,"" and my wife said her diet would only allow a couple. And then they were gone. My wife made a note to spend an extra hour on the dreadmill.

My wife's Nevada Beef Burger with Smoked Brisket, Mac & Cheese, and Aged Sharp Cheddar ($16) was cooked to order and had the texture and flavor that sets grass-fed beef apart from the corny variety, but the brisket didn't present much smoke or additional flavor. The result was just one form of beef on top of another, and a little underseasoned. I couldn't detect the cheddar apart from the mac & cheese, and we both felt the pasta did nothing to elevate the dish. If anything, all that extra stuff just covered up a really good bite of grass-fed beef. Side note on the side dish: her salad was crisp, with tomatoes possessing real flavor and a delicious housemade dressing.

My cup of American Bison Chili ($6) was not noticeably different from any other bean chili. If you're going to use a spotlight ingredient, make sure I can tell it's there. Any sense of that deliciously lean meat was lost amongst the beans, peppers, tomato, onion, garlic, sour cream, and cheddar. It was tasty, but you'd never know it was bison. Having said that, the side of Crackling Bacon Cornbread should--by law--be served with every kind of chili served anywhere at any time.

My Fork entree, Fettuccine, was perfection on a plate ($15). Housemade black pepper pasta with asparagus, red pepper, cauliflower, sun-dried tomato, and a garlic cream sauce topped with fresh parmesan. I'm not going to say much more because if you like fettuccine and vegetables, you're going to love this.

We each ordered a Dessert of the Day ($6) with mixed results. The Chocolate Pecan Pie (with whipped cream) sounded like my wife's dream come true, yet was nearly inedible. Very dry, crumbly, with a dark chocolate that just didn't deliver on flavor. The Blackberry Crème Brûlée was totally opposite; a lightly caramelized top concealing fresh berries and a perfectly balanced custard.

Ultimately I think these folks just need some time to find their balance, because our overall experience left us eager to try everything on the menu.",2015-02-05 20:34:41
FV7VHhUEsL8WYpTRYGo9wQ,ieXhX5f5bJQcn2FJK0-dbg,v17tgCRjuPQiFOq4uvEI-w,3.0,7,2,3,"The good: Food was delicious, restaurant was very clean and modern looking, and the owner was sweet.  It also doesn't hurt that I live only a mile away! 

The bad: SLOWEST SERVICE EVER.  Imagine waiting 30 minutes in line at a Qdoba or a Panera.  And THEN waiting another 15-20 minutes for your food to be brought out.  Painful, right?  We were in and out in 70 minutes...for a ""fast"" casual establishment. 

If the restaurant owner/staff is reading this, you MUST work on your operations before you quickly lose significant business.  I want this place to thrive but you need to churn out food within a reasonable timeframe.  

We had bibimbop and the chap chae.  I am familiar with the sweet potato noodles used in chap chae, and they do not take a long time to cook.  I understand you don't want to make them ahead of time because they can dry out, but that's why there should always be a pot of boiling water ready to go when an order comes in. Our chap chae didn't come out for 20 (agonizing) minutes.  Thankfully, it was delicious.  

Tips for the restaurant: 
1)  Model Chipotle's assembly line - assign one person to get the dishes ""started"" (prepare tortillas, rice, noodles) and serve the meat; then designate another employee to get the vegetables and to ring up at the cashier.  In the 30 minutes we were in line, I saw the cashier stand there - doing absolutely nothing - while the owner and another employee were serving customers.  Not efficient. 

2)  Use tongs instead of spoons for the ingredients (except rice).  The staff serving the customer before me was getting meat for tacos. It. Took. FOREVER.  Saving 15 seconds by using tongs doesn't sound significant.  However, when you have 15 seconds per ingredient, each customer has at least 6 ingredients, and 15 customers are in line, that will quickly slow down the process. 

3)  Place labels on the sneeze guard for the vegetables, so that when customers look at the vegetables, the labels line up next to the vegetables.  That way, you don't have to explain to every single customer, saving time. Or alternatively, display photos of the vegetables with detailed descriptions, along the wall where people wait in line, so they know exactly what they want when it's their turn.  

4)  Invest in a small griddle in the front kitchen for making eggs.  I understand it's not feasible to create a window so that you can shout for an egg to the back kitchen staff, but when it's part of your most popular dishes, it's probably going to be a lot quicker this way.  Otherwise, you have to run in the back each time, and make the customer wait at the front, holding up the line.  

I'll hold off another month before giving this place one more shot.  I gave it three stars instead of 1 or 2 because I really liked the dishes, and Carmel is in great need of Korean food.  I really hope they can clean up their act quickly!",2016-01-30 15:33:45
-cJqwfAk9FTn8HcSRoc5NQ,VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,Vf0inZOaad8sv1uG8mGIGw,4.0,16,12,15,"Visited on Saturday 10/29/16 at 8PM.   $84 got us two hibachi dinners and two drinks.  This place is not really a ""steak house"" but rather a teppenyaki place that also serves sushi and alcoholic beverages as well as desserts.  

We came at a peak time and had to wait about an hour but they have a nice outdoor waiting area with plenty of seating and the weather was nice so it wasn't so bad.  We signed up with the hostess and she gave us a buzzer to alert us when our table was ready. 

We were seated at a double table that had two griddles and seated 15-17 people.  First came the drinks and then the waiter took everybody's order.  I chose the $30 steak & scallop combination.  The waiter took everyone's menus and in a few minutes brought out soup for everyone. 

The soup was touted as an onion soup...the broth was hot and delicious.  It was full of those shitty fried onions that your grandma puts on green bean casseroles and raw mushrooms which I did not enjoy very much.  I think they'd be better off if they'd just use caramelized onions and cook the mushrooms a bit more.  

Next came the salads which were nothing special and looked identical to the bagged iceberg mix you can buy at any grocery store complete with shaved carrots and purple cabbage.  It was doused in a generous amount of ginger dressing which was good but there was just too much of it.  I had to dig pieces of lettuce out of the bowl of dressing and wipe them on my napkin to eat them. 

Next the chef came out and began his routine.  He was young and cute and very good at what he does.  He had a cheesy but good sense of humor and really wowed us with his skills.  He  knew all the good tricks like the fried rice heart, flipping an egg into his hat, flipping a shrimp into his pocket, and of course the onion volcano. 

Fried rice and noodles are served with every entree and they were very tasty.  I loved my steak and scallops and there was SO MUCH FOOD!  Seriously I spent the whole next day trying to eat all the leftovers. 

Our dining companions all raved about a sauce called ""yum-yum sauce"" which I tried and did not care for much.  It was like somebody added sugar to ranch dressing.  Everyone else at the table was requesting double and triple portions of the stuff and just pouring it all over their food so it's worth a try if you go...you might like it that much too! 

Like any other teppenyaki place, you go for the show and the atmosphere and less for the food but the food was also very good here.  It's a great place to celebrate a special occasion and I enjoyed it enough that I'd definitely go back.",2016-11-03 19:53:56

We checked in at the desk at 2:45pm to get our room keys. We were informed that our room was not ready. We finally received a notice that our room was ready at 6:45pm. 

Granted there was a large convention in town but this doesn't seem very efficient. We had a meeting early in the morning so we called the front desk and requested a wake up call for 4:30am. 

We woke up and realized it was 5:30am. We called the desk to find out what happened. They apologized for they entered the wrong room number in. 

Apon returning to our room that night we again requested another wake up call at 4:30am. We decided to set an alarm as well. Our alarm went off at 4:30am and yet again no wake up call. 

5am a wake up call comes in. We informed the mod and stopped using their wake up call service. 

During lunch we decided to have some pizza delivered from a local pizza shop. The front desk called the room to inform us that our pizza had arrived and the driver was not allowed to come up to the room. 

We consumed one of our pizzas and had to leave to go to a business meeting. We left our second pizza on the counter with a note on the box to the house keeping staff to leave alone and to NOT throw away. 

Upon returning to our room our pizza was gone. I noticed that there was still a house keeping crew on our floor. I asked the crew if they had seen the pizza in our room and what happened to it. The house keeper said she thought it was trash and pitched it.

We called up to the front desk and requested to speak to a supervisor, we explained what had happened. They apologized and we requested that they replace the pizza. shortly after the house keeping manager and the house keeper came up and apologized for the incident.

After a bit room service brought up a replacment pizza, afterwards we discovered that there was a receipt showing a balance due. We called the front desk back and discovered that the pizza had been added to our room charges. 

All in all this was a very disappointing experience with a hotel that comes with such high customer reviews.",2017-02-22 06:10:32
ot_Zb6EhwXTzGCIKFBtaMw,DTF0SwMYAbIyahRi8v-vSw,8La5f_qz3LlTD_GipZTYuw,1.0,7,0,0,"Okay. I don't usually write negative reviews, in fact this is my first one , but I feel compelled to expose the incompetence of the staff at Johnson Family Dental. Absolutely and utterly incompetent. Do not ever expect something to be scheduled correctly because it won't happen!!! 

Here are my most recent and most unfortunate experience with this abomination of a business: 

I was told that I needed 3 crowns on my molars. NOTE: I already had two of the three crowns, but Dr. Johnson'a staff wanted to REPLACE them even though HIS OFFICE put them on for me about four years ago... the third crown was for a tooth on the bottom that has a calcium defect and is an off-white color in some places. I have had it checked by three different dentists in Santa Barbara who have all assured me it is only a cosmetic thing and the tooth is perfectly healthy. Needless to say, I haven't gotten it ""fixed"" because it's in the back of my mouth and doesn't bother me. 

Anyway, I was still urged by staff at Johnson Dental to make an appointment to have it fixed. NOTE: I am 24 and have my own insurance through work which I am fortunate to have 100% coverage for dental AND I am still covered 100% by my fathers insurance as I'm not 26 yet... is Johnson Dental trying to take advantage of my insurances and make money off of me... ??? probably. 

So I made the appointment to get the 3 crowns and I asked who the best dentist to see would be and was told that Dr. Johnson himself was the best but wouldn't be able to see me for at least 3 months. So I made the appointment for three months out and waited, patiently. 

On the morning of the appointment, I checked in and was told Dr. Johnson was not who I would be seeing that day. After I had waited three months to SPECIFICALLY see him. Like how does that even get messed up..!! Eventually it was sorted out and I met with Dr. Johnson. 

Dr. Johnson was actually in shock that he was supposed to be placing a crown on my lower tooth and was astonished that I was recommended to have a crown placed on it. As politely as I could I informed him that it was HIS staff who had incessantly pestered me both in person and with follow up text messages to have the procedure done. He was also surprised that I wanted to ""re-do"" the two crowns that were on the top which were relatively new as well. I told him that his staff had also recommended those as well and since I had already taken a day off of work to be here (I had to take off a 12 hour work day) and I was basically 200% covered with dental insurance, that I might as well have the procedure since I was already there. It was decided that only the top two crowns would be replaced and the bottom tooth, was absolutely fine. 

The procedure went smoothly, thankfully, however, it wasn't until after the procedure that shit really hit the fan. 

The temporary crowns that Dr. Johnson's assistant had placed on my teeth were not properly fitted. I mentioned that they felt much too long when she was asking my how the felt after they were placed in. She told me that since my mouth was numb I probably wasn't able to feel them correctly but I insisted they were way too long and hitting my bottom molars in a way the top teeth never did. She did not adjust them for me.

I am a professional bartender and restaurant manager by trade and went in for a possible position at their bar in Riverview. After a great conversation I was then interviewed by Shannon and Kyle whom were very nice knowledgeable and friendly.  They invited me back for a second interview with a Damon Russo on a Mon 2-4. I came in at 3 and he wasn't in.  So I tried back, still wasn't there so I was told to come in the next day and he would be able to sit down with me.
I came in he was on the phone and when he finished the conversation he walked to the back.  The hostess already informed Shannon and him I was there, and why.  So after standing in the lobby area like a jerk for 25 minutes I asked Shannon if he realized I was there?  She walks to the back and a hostess walks up and says he said you can leave your resume.  I stated that he had it already that this was a second interview.  It was not like I was walking up demanding a interview, but the way i have always done business if I commit to a second interview even if I am not interested I at least tell them that or tell them thanks for coming in.  After all I did drive out here now four different times.  End result is the guy made Shannon come back out and tell me she could take my resume?  When she was the one who took the first one.  I have been denied a job before and it is fine, I have even been talked down to at a interview and that was fine.  I just feel if you or your staff makes a appointment on your behalf you should at the very least honor it by showing face. It seems very disrespectful that the upper management lacks integrity and failed to show me decent courtesy. By not even walking out to say hello or sorry I dont have time. 
Figured I would post this in hopes that someone with the company will see this and address it.  If this guy lacks the conviction to follow up on a prior commitment witha potential employee.  How does he handle guest relations on your companies behalf

Advantage is to rental cars as horses are to glue factories. It's where old cars go to die. Even as I'm waiting in line to rent the car I'm regretting it. I have to hear the agent go thru the entire spiel to fellow travelers about upgrading, letting them fill up the gas tank and buying additional insurance. So I think I get an edge when I hand over my credit card and say ""I'm telling you now I am not upgrading the car, I'll purchase my own gas and I do not need any of your insurance."" Do you think he'd let it go like that? No, he has to harass you for 10 more minutes and try putting the fear of God in you to try and get their insurance. Okay I get through that. I go out to the car and it's disgusting. I don't know if they washed it with dirty water or what but it looks like a family of six rented this car for a trip to the zoo and brought the animals back with them. There was a used tissue in the console, the floor wasn't vacuumed and I could barely see out of the window. I asked them about it and they claimed they just washed it. This is the 3rd or 4th time I have rented with Advantage and it will be my last. They NEVER clean their cars. It's not worth the $15 I saved. The car made a funny noise the entire time I had it. I was constantly wondering if I'd make it back. Then the address for the rental building wasn't a real address so I had to pull over and call to get one I could put in my GPS to return the car. 

As if that wasn't bad enough when I went to return the car there were people standing all over the parking lot waiting to return their car. I tried to go inside but they refused to check me in. They don't seem to understand people are renting because they have flights to catch. They had one shuttle and it just pulled out when I pulled in. Half an hour later there were still people waiting in front of me when the shuttle came back. I finally took my cell phone out, took pictures all around the car and threw my keys to the guy in the lot. I told him I was getting on the shuttle and I'd pick up my receipt online. I can only pray that's the end of it. Do NOT rent with this company. Maybe it is like the glue factory. They use it to hold their cars together!",2011-12-16 23:43:02

First of all the service is outstanding.  Every time.  It may seem a little out of the way, but its worth it to go, plus the drive out there is so pretty.  And now that Six Flags is open, we'll be stopping in more often now that we know where it is, that's the way we take home every weekend.... lol  But really, it's only about 5 minutes from Burlington.  

The eggs benedict is now my new favorite in the area.  Their hollendaise is so good I could drink it.  The waffles and french toast are so decadent and delicious, and are about the size of my head.  HUGE.  And I think they were only 4 bucks.  Can't beat that.  The coffee is the best.  If I lived close enough I would stop in for morning coffee to go every day.  A diner should be judged by the caliber of their coffee, and this is 5 star worthy coffee.  lol  

The chicken parm is out of this world.  Yall, they put ravioli's ON TOP of the parm.  What more could you want?  lol  The texas meatloaf is also insanely delicious.  Meatloaf with bacon, cheddar and bbq sauce on top of mashed potatoes with ONION RINGS on top of all of that.  I mean.... it's crazy!  But amazing!  Plus, you get soup, salad AND a piece of cake!  All of the sides I've had so far were actually FRESH veggies, not frozen, and were seasoned well.  Green beans were great and still crisp, and the mashed potatoes were REAL potatoes not from a box.  

The meatball sub was so big it actually didn't fit on the plate.  Seriously.  It's OVER a foot long.  Hubby said ""It'll do.""  Which is code for it's REALLY good.  He could only eat half, which is odd for him but it was ginormous.  The fries are actually really good here, really crispy and seasoned properly.  No bland, soggy fries at Pandora.  

The wraps are also huge, my portabella mushroom wrap had FRESH sauteed mushrooms and spinach.  It's probably my favorite thing I've ordered so far.  If you want something healthy, this is perfect.  All the sandwiches AND SALADS come with a cup of soup.  So if you are in the mood for soup and salad or sandwich this is perfect!  (Which is what I usually order anyhow...) The broccoli cheddar and french onion are my favorite.  

Their desserts are phenomenal.  Not to mention they take the time to put lil designs on the plates and really make it feel special.  Boston creme, Italian Rum, Vanilla Raspberry.... they are really beautiful and yummy!

Granted, most reviews were focused on the sales side and my review is based on my experiences with the service side.

I was here once before, about 3.5 years ago, when maintenance was done in the smaller garage.  

Since moving back to Nashville, I've been here 3 times; twice for oil change/tire rotations and once to replace the drive belt and water pump.  On the second occasion, manager, Eric Jones came to let me know what issues they found while oiling/rotating.  I loved the fact they checked everything they checked, even though I wasn't coming to have those things checked.  He let me know how my tires were doing, other parts of the car that I don't really know about, and the fact that the belt was wearing down and the water pump was leaking, which could burn out my engine.  He gave me a costs, explanations, and a time frame of when I should get back in to the shop and said he would show me the water pump so I could monitor the coolant levels.

I paid my $40 for the oil/rotation (1/2 of what I expected to pay) and met Eric in the garage, where he and several other employees came over to show me/shine a flashlight/etc.  As we were talking, Danny Tyce, who had admitted my car when I arrived, came over and was already up to speed on how my car was and what needed to be done in the future.  He told me to wait a moment and went into the office to speak with the boss.  When he returned, he said that although my warranty was expired, they would give an extension and cover the other maintenance up to $500...I'm sorry, are you an angel?!?!

Since we didn't want the boss to forget, I made an appointment for the next morning.  The water pump would have been about $480, then the belt, taxes, and service fees.  I was expecting somewhere between $500-$600 total and knew I would need to cover anything over $500.  I was also expecting to get my car back in 4-6 hours.  Not only did they finish in 2 hours & 40 mins (maybe even 35!!), but my out of pocket cost was $0!  That's right, zilch, nada, nuttin!!  I wanted to bow to Danny, put him on a billboard, get his name in lights....something!

I can't thank all of these professional, friendly, nice people.  Everyone I have encountered here on all separate trips has truly been a pleasure.  The first time I came, Ryan admitted me, and I remember still that he was very kind and helpful too.

They have lots of comfortable seating, a TV, coffee, vending machines, a kid's playroom, and free WiFi.

I brought my man here for his Birthday. We got a complementary Himalayan salt meditation, and then I paid $270 for a couples massage. First of all, whoever they had at the front desk that day, was super unprofessional she was sitting with her legs up on the chair, with holes on her leggings. She also didn't bother to greet us. She then just handed us our clipboards, and told us to fill out our papers for the massage. There were so many other things I could say but it's pretty much irrelevant at this point. Just know the customer service isn't great (you can see that from other reviews). The meditation was the Best part. I would actually recommend that, if you want a good nap... 


Ok, now for the real reason I wrote this review.
We both got a couples massage in the same room. The lady that gave him his massage made him feel uncomfortable. She was talking about having their minds and spirits connect during the massage. And then she kept walking back-and-forth from her table to the massage bed but it was excessive. Since there's salt on the floor, you can hear every bit of crunching. She tried putting his arms behind his back and told him to relax and then proceeded to rub massage oil all over his body but didn't give him a massage. At one point she even told him to close his eyes (he opened them to see what she was doing because she kept walking back and forth) and proceeded to rub his eyelids in a circular motion (wtf). He didn't want me to complain,but I paid a lot of money for a service that didn't get done. It was embarrassing and disappointing that he was so appalled by the service. 
I called the next day, and the manager on site said that she would call the owner and get back to me. Well, she never got back to me. I placed a follow up call again, a week later. The manager also proceeded to tell me that the therapist was putting his arms behind his back because it was a Thai massage technique... they don't even offer Thai massages here...  I paid for a Swedish massage. Initially, I told her I enjoyed my massage, and that I didn't want a full refund, I just wanted a partial refund. I never got an apology. Instead I got excuses and this super uncalled for letter from the owner who wrote me a check for $65. A simple I'm sorry your experience was negative or something... other than a boastful  bitter ego trippen pointless analogy letter.",2019-08-07 21:54:00

I visited on a Thursday afternoon. It was quiet and there weren't many kids around. The receptionist, although very nice, was young an inexperienced and had a hard time stumbling through the different options. To become a member, it's $80 per month and you get access to the pool for like 4 random hours a day, tennis courts, and the weight room. I peeked out at the pool and it was not quite full and green but the nice girl assured me they were ""trying to get the chemicals right"" and it would be open by Monday.

 I paid the membership fee for 3 months and I was shocked to find out there's no membership card or check in process...you can just walk right in. That made me feel very unsafe...like just anybody could walk in and snatch a child. How do they know who paid and who didn't? It seemed very fishy.

I came back today 6-5-19 to take the boy for a swim.  I noticed the building is very old, dirty, and in disrepair. The gym is very sad looking and the weight room is tiny and smelly. The locker rooms are filthy and half the doors are torn off the lockers. I saw lots of unsafe conditions for children to be in like nails sticking up and very old (lead?) paint peeling. 

We went out to the pool and there wasn't a single adult in sight. There were teenage lifeguards and about fifty children in a roped off 20x10 foot area of the pool for open swim time. The children were shoulder to shoulder and there was literally no way for us to get in. 

It's clear that this place is for dropping off your kids for a few hours, lessons, and summer camp. In my opinion it's not a good place for a parent to take a small child swimming. 

I am painfully non-confrontational and generally anxious but I went inside to see about getting a refund. The lady behind the counter made me feel horrible because as I was explaining why this place wasn't what I expected or wanted she raised her eyebrows and gave me a confused look. She took a long time pressing me about exactly what I didn't like and giving me excuses. I tried to stay pleasant and polite and she finally reluctantly refunded my money. By the end of it I was shaking and ready to cry. I really hate sticking up for myself but this place is just so bad I couldn't bear the thought of coming back. 


I'm sure this place is serving the community in a great way, but it's more of a daycare than a public pool.",2019-06-06 03:42:57

Open 11 AM - 10 PM Monday thru Saturday, & 11 AM till 8 PM on Sundays, live music is scheduled every Friday evening then again on Sundays mid-day. 

You can enjoy a $13 Sampler Flight; it includes 5 tasters of any draft beer. Currently, there are 17 beers on tap. There's also an online store for Brew Works merchandise (w/ merchandise also sold on site, including gift cards). Every Sunday, $1 from every pint sold is donated to a local charity or nonprofit. (The December recipient is The Nashville Food Project.)

Executive Chef Alex Liebow is responsible for the ""craft beer-inspired food menu."" Private events are held at the distillery.

The 6-beer ""Beer Burger"" was exceptional! And  the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich was also delicious, although you may want to ask for more heat if you are keen on spice. Unlike some chefs @ other eateries, our chef today was kind enough to split our entrees for us before they were brought to our table-- we appreciated it. The $12 Mint Julep was good, but costly. Our best edible, though, was the side salad-- Cesar Salad made w/ Baby Kale. Truly a PHENOMENAL tasting salad! 

Pete E was a very friendly server, & twice management took the time to stop by our table to converse. Loved the customer attention! 

This distillery offers a small first floor corner stage for live music, oak-barrel tables, two floors of dining, a front raised open patio w/ infrared heaters, a second floor open patio (roped off today), a bar on the second floor w/ an overview of the actual distillery, & a closeup of the distillery as patrons make their way to the back restrooms (where only one diner may enter & exit @ a time-- see pic). 

This aestetically pleasing establishment, w/ its excellent beers & delicious handhelds, is a great place to unwind. And the second floor dining area would be a perfect place for a birthday celebration or other type of gathering-- see pic. 

You'll find no paper menus here & even the receipts are to be scanned. Curbside pickup & no contact delivery are offered services. 

Quite impressed w/ this distillery & eatery. Located in the downtown Nashville area, this would easily become my hangout if I resided in the area.",2020-12-25 13:14:06
MQvMF61LkrnMFA-iNRDOhA,hljygU-cnN18bu5SCKIetw,DifPLtmibq02kpO7-f4h-g,1.0,2,0,0,"About a decade ago, I bought a 2006 330xi in the US and brought it up here. Not knowing where to take it, I started going to Bavaria for regular maintenance.

For the first couple years, I had no complaints. Sometimes regular maintenance would find some necessary additional work, and as expected with European cars it wasn't always cheap. Once I asked then to see if they could fix a motor on a rear window shade, and they got $400 in before realizing the problem could be another $1200 to fix, but even then they were up-front about what they found and I was grateful not to spend more on something trivial. Generally, I was treated well and had no real complaints.

About five years ago my car wouldn't start and couldn't be boosted or trickle-charged. I expected it was the battery, and had it towed to the dealer to be replaced.

The next day, I called to ask when my car would be ready and was told the new battery was in but wasn't holding a charge. They expected there was a short somewhere and asked for authority to spend $300-$400 in shop time to find it. Clearly this was a problem that needed fixing, and so I authorized the work.

The following week, I checked in. They still hadn't found the problem and again asked me to pay for more shop time to find it. Again, everything seemed fine and I agreed. 

Near the end of the week, as I was about to leave on holiday, same call and request. At this point I was genuinely worried that something more serious was involved and said I was prepared to authorize the time as long as they found the problem. They agreed, and I asked them to call me on my cell the next week.

By the end of the following week I'd still heard nothing. Now I was angry, and so called from my hotel to ask what had happened. I was told that they had finally located the problem and could fix it -- huzzah! 

Then they told me the problem was with the negative battery cable. There was a short and it was draining the battery.  That seemed, to me at least, something that shouldn't have required over $1K in shop time to figure out. To me, the battery cables are the first place you look! 

And now I was truly mad. I made clear my displeasure on the phone, said I would be back in a couple of days to get my car and asked that it be ready. They told me that the total cost of a new battery, shop time and the cable fix would be around $2600, and I said I wanted an itemized bill describing exactly what was done to justify the expense.

I went and picked up the car early the next week. At this point, they had my car for almost three weeks, and replaced two items which were less than half the cost of my total bill. Knowing I was angry, they cut the final amount to ~$2000. I wrote on their copy of the invoice that I reserved the right to dispute the bill & take legal action, and left.

I wanted to sue, but didn't know on what basis I could do so. Was the problem really so hard to find, or was I just mad it cost so much? So I started looking at forums and searching online about this issue and found this:

https://www.google.ca/amp/jalopnik.com/5896484/bmw-recalls-13-million-cars-for-battery-cable-cover/amp

Turns out a substantial number of battery cable failures had happened on 5 Series BMWs necessitating a recall.  (A couple years later, a recall was issued for 3 series cars, although not my model make & year, but it seemed clear it was a similar problem.)  That recall had been issued before I took my car in, which means the problem itself had been discovered some time before. 

It struck me that even an idiot might have looked at the battery cables knowing all that -- but why bother when your idiot customer didn't know any better?  I didn't sue, but I never took my car back there, and I wondered if they'd ever taken advantage of my willingness to believe what they told me previously. Who knows, but I sure as hell wasn't aiming to find out.

I can't speak to the abilities of their sales staff, but I can say without hesitation that my experience with the service department over what was a pretty simple problem means I'd recommend going absolutely anywhere else before taking your car there. They keep sending me stuff in the mail trying to get me to come back or buy another car, but I sold the car about 18 months ago and wouldn't consider going there in any event.",2017-09-10 06:29:43

The management company kept changing every year and thats why there are only a few reviews on this page. Refer to the link below and also to the ones on Google.  
https://yelp.to/qTKq/4Qhwssm8mX
Btw you should know that if everyone is talking about the same topics - for instance how residents' cars are towed, and etc - it means its really happening and they are not exaggerating. 

Just to give you an idea, i am such a lazy person who almost never writes reviews about anything anywhere, but i just had to write this one because I am that frustrated right now. (FYI it never made me to actually write a negative review when my car was towed from the gated parking lot TWICE and i had to take a uber to the lot where they towed my car to and pay over $200 to have it back, when my parents visited and they had to park their car on a street nearby for EVERY SINGLE NIGHT (FYI the street is where parked cars had their windows broken by someone last year. Police cars were all over the place on that day interviewing residents) because Alden Park does not allow visitor parkings any more due to their issues of limited parking spaces which they are obviously trying to solve by towing their own residents' cars, when the hallways smelled like marijuas which i dont understand how someone could smoke them since there are young children living in this building - i would never want to have my babies here, and when the AC hasnt been working for more than a month (its still not working) and no one came in to fix even after my five previous calls to the maintenance staff (i wonder how many calls i would have to make to have it fixed. Do they have a minimum number of resident calls policy?) and when maintenance staff actually visit for other issues while you are not at home they never leave notes that they were here and leave traces all over the place so that you blindedly guess next day that they visited). I know all these issues sound crazy enough already, but like i said, i am that lazy. I somehow even managed to convince myself that this is actually not such a bad place to live in considering the rent.

WHAT I CANT TOLERATE, HOWEVER, IS THE CRAZY NOISE LEVEL AT THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. By middle of the night, i dont mean like 11pm or midnight. It means 2am til 4am and even later when it gets bad. Right now its ALMOST 3AM and theres obviously a drinking party going on somewhere around my unit (im not sure if its above, below or somewhere on my floor) and people have been shouting after the music that is already loud, jumping, clapping, screaming, laughing, and constantly droppig thinngs on the floor and I CAN HEAR EVERYTHING. The noise level is just so outrageous today that i seriously would have called the police to stop the party if i had known where its taking place. I dont understand how people have no manners and not realize this is not their own house and its a shared community. This is certainly not the first time people are having parties or watch movies or concert videos (i can tell if they are watching a Marvel movie or a concert by a rapper where people would clap so hard everytime a song is finished) at this late hour even on weekdays (like on Tuesdays. Do these people not work?) However tonight is the worst of all and here i am writing this review so that no one else would have to go through something like this and be as frustrated as i am right now. 

I tried writing about this to the management company and asked them to remind all residents the simple etiquette that you need to control your noise level down low especially when everyone is sleeping, but like most of the times, i never got replies. I have been suffering with all these music and people screaming for the last 2hours already tonight and i am so mad that theres nothing i can do other than simply waiting for these parties to be over. I wish i can upload a recording file up here so that you can hear how loud this is. This is insane. I am so looking foward to the date when my lease is over and i finally get to escape this place.",2019-06-09 07:14:50
dEYiZn6dzIfL5xlCBj3rew,wufjCSadQthVjcThP1hOMw,36E5Ta_trKDzedSB-WpkZw,1.0,5,1,1,"This review is for Ray Brandt Toyota used cars across the street.   This one star is not for Sales rep Frankie, Timmy or Mario but for Daryl who is Ray Brandt's son in law.  This man has no business managing a car dealership.  No communication skills.   Monday February 20, 2017 I purchased a 2015 Chevy Cruze.  Too late to have the car cleaned that day had to go back the next day to get car cleaned.   Got in the car to take to dealership and Service light is on.  By the time I got to the dealership the car was smoking.   Now I want to be honest I did 
NOT buy a warranty with the car.   I had not even owned the car 24 hours.   Daryl was there and was like: "" Oh well you know you didn't buy the warranty,  we only made $108 on your car"".   I told you at length to get the warranty.  So the warranty was $2000 for 3 years and a $100 deducticle every time I used it.   A rip off if you ask me and that is why I didn't get it.   Point black Daryl could have cared less if the car was running or not.  My issue and my problem.  I was hysterical to say the least.   Then he finally tells me to go to Ray Brandt new car dealership and get the car on the computer to find out the code.   Guess what:  the radiator seal was off (how does that happen?).  Antifreeze was spilling out onto the engine and burning.   So Ray Brandt new car service David said I will get you a new cap tomorrow from Chevy next door.   He said I will top off the coolant and we reset the code.  Now it's Wednesday, February 22nd, the light comes back on and I am on my way to the dealership to get the new cap put on.   David in service puts the cap on and says well we found any code on the car-catalytic converter problem  on a 2 year old car.    Again he said we will reset the code but he told me that if the code comes back on, i need to take to Chevy to have them put it on their computer to see exactly what is the matter.   Now last night service light still off and I got the car cleaned and some gentleman profusely apologized to me about the experience but it wasn't DARYL which is who I wanted the apology from.   Now today, February 24th, guess what the service light code is on and I made an appointment tomorrow at Best Chevy to have the car put on the computer to see what is the matter with the car.   You think Ray Brandt used cars gonna make this right?   This whole experience has been a NIGHTMARE!!!!  I work for a very large healthcare organization I am pretty sure everyone can guess and i  have already told all of my co-workers to NEVER STEP FOOT ON THIS DEALERSHIP LOT.    I truely feel screwed out of this deal.   Moral of the story:   run and hide from Ray Brandt used cars on Veterans right next door to the Walmart.
Update:   Last Friday 2/24/2017 Ray Brandt took the car to Chevy for diagnostics and gave me a rent a car and the catalytic converter was bad.  Ray Brandt did pay for the part so  cost to me but the hassle to get this done.   So i get my car back same day.  No lights on car.  Yeah!
Today, Friday 3/3/2017 guess what:  Service engine light is back on again.   OMG!  Left message with Danny who is in charge of Ray Brandt Toyota service.
Well it's Monday 3/6/2017 I never received a call from Danny in Service doesn't  surprise me at all.  I did talk to Mario on Friday who told me ""that he would make this right"".  The Oxygen sendor number 2 is going out which all coinsides with the catalytic converter.   I tried calling Mario and he isn't there yet at noon, I tried calling Danny no answer no reply.   This is a joke and this dealership is a joke.   People go deal with Lakeside Toyota and skip this place.  Also when I looked at my engine when I took it to Pepboys to see what the code was this time, you should see all the dried antifreeze on my engine.  You would've thought that they could at least clean it after the new radiator cap got put on but NO.   If one person doesn't do business with Ray Brandt Toyota then I have done my job writing this term paper of a review on a crappy dealership.",2017-02-24 14:35:01

I just moved to Philly from NYC and Tinto is very close to my new place.  After yelping for a place to grab dinner and seeing the great reviews, we walked the couple blocks to try it.  It was a Wed night at 8pm and we were told the wait for a table would be an hour and a half.  You have to give the place credit for its popularity, I guess. They were able to seat us immediately at the bar, which we were fine with.

The sangria was among the very few highlights of our night.  We ordered by the glass and didn't get the watered down flavor that some yelpers have complained about. And then we moved on to the menu...

My first thought was, wow, I thought I'd save a little money in Philly vs. NYC!  Clearly not by eating here. For the atmosphere, portion size (tiny) and quality of the food, I would never pay these prices again - even in NYC!  We actually considered heading home immediately to order pizza instead....and should have.

In an effort to help you brave ones that are still going to try Tinto, you should avoid at all costs:
- Crab with peas and Benton's bacon (what IS this? they make such a big deal of calling it out in the menu and when they bring the food...looks like plain old bacon).  This dish was woefully under-seasoned and tasted like...nothing!  The crab meat looked beautiful, but even that couldn't save the dish.

- Pork belly with apple. Let me say, I love pork and anything resembling bacon and found this dish shockingly bland and borderline gross. Couldn't finish my one little crustini.

- Figs wrapped in serano ham.  It's a straight lie to call these ""wrapped,"" the meat was simply placed over raw figs. Meh. Try bacon wrapped dates next time, Tinto.

Some things were OK:
- Arugula salad was the lone highlight - sad for a tapas place - but it was a genuinely good salad....if a little to cute (read: very small).

- Shrimp brushetta - good flavor, but another lie to call this brushetta, at least to Americans.  It was two prawns on a plate, heads still on.  Not a cube of tomato or toast in sight.

- Organic chicken with mash - again tiny portions of under-seasoned food, but way above most of what we ordered.

We left hungry and dissatisfied with the bang we received for our $100 bucks (incl tip) and proceeded directly to the market to claim a couple of comforting pints of B&J's.

I won't be back.  Too many great places in Philly to revisit this flop!",2009-10-01 16:10:14

1) We didn't know about the medical student discount before we booked the hotel but they added it anyway. Instead of paying over $200 for 2 double full beds, I think we paid $189. Via the NBOME website, stated prices ranged from $110-140. 

2) The wifi said that it would cost us $9.95 to connect but the front desk said we didn't have to pay for it.

3) The concierge room on the 16th floor is probably the most posh hotel lounge that we've been too, design-wise, with ambiance lighting, mating colors, tvs.  They served assorted desserts (cookies and brownies), nuts, alcohol, coffee, tea, other assorted drinks from the evening 'til 10pm and my roommate and I felt a little unsure about whether it was okay to eat some of the free items.  The night concierge Luigi was very friendly and helpful.  We were so unused to good service and little embarassed about the ""freeloading."" We also met another student from New York who was taking the test. There were even more options during breakfast and it was a high-quality meal as well - oatmeal, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, all sorts of condiments, granola, Wheaties, fruit (melons, strawberries, bananas, apples), grapefruits juice/orange juice/cranberry juice, yogurt, just to name a few. 

4) Free bottled water in the hallways. 

5) The facilities were modern and clean. They had a computer room with a printer which we used to check in and print our boarding passes.

6) There was also a pool and work-out room as well as a bar lounge that we didn't have time to check out but I'm sure they would have been top of the line as well.

7) It was in a very convenient location, one minute driving from our testing center and 10 min walking.  Although a little confusing to find at night, it is to the right of the Lukoil gas station if that makes it easier to spot.

8) Plenty of parking.  It was a little annoying to have to drive all the way down, all 3 ground floors to get out though.

If I have a few complaints, it would be that we didn't have double sinks in our room and our bathtub was somewhat clogged. The A/C and heat also can get quite loud at night so don't let it scare you or wake you up.  I'm use the concierge also has earplugs you could have.

I live about 10 minutes away from this place and have seen it before but never went in. I was browsing yelp to find a sushi place to try and this came up and got some good reviews so I decided to give it a go (what a mistake).

First, its 12:30 on a sunday afternoon, there's not a soul in there (now I know why) which always bothers me a little and gives me an erie sense of the place.

Next, there selling cheap pencils and earrings on the front counter (wtf?), the place is decent looking inside, but decorations are sparse with empty walls. Tables have white linens on them, but are all wrinkled, they also have those condiment caddys on the table with a cheap looking laminated ""specials"" card on them, along with those ""McCormick"" salt and pepper grinders (again wtf?). I'm not sure how you can expect to sell entrees in the mid to high 20s with the things I've mentioned already. But unfortunately it gets worse.

The waitor was arrogant and not very friendly, and was blasting sports center in a dim lit sushi bar. He even went to one of the tables and made a load cell phone call, which I thought was very rude.

Next the food, I ordered two rolls and an order of seaweed salad. They came out about 10 minutes later with little presentation. The seaweed salad was clearly packaged and greasy, and was garnished with a shredded crab stick and chopped cucumber from the sushi bar. The sushi was terrible, I mean bad. The rice was all wrong, mushy, flavorless, tasted like instant. The fish not much better, first off it was warm, not sure why, but I like my raw fish chilled. The smoked salmon was dry and fishy and must have been in an open package all week, the spicy tuna, weak, bland flavorless orange mush, no spice to it at all. Even the wasabi was bad, it had no flavor and no kick at all, I mean at all. It was like putting green toothpaste on ur sushi (which actually would have been nice because I feel like I need to brush my teeth now).

Sorry for the bad review guys but that sucked. I just hope somebody sees this and doesn't waste their money like I did.",2011-07-31 17:45:04

Arrived before 1, saw the crazy traffic, so came back an hour later, try #2, got dropped off at Cheesecake Factory (where I had been looking forward to eat all day, hence a second trip by, and was starving by now), I waited in the bar for my husband to park after getting  a pager for a 30 min wait, ordered a drink, only for my husband not able to find parking ANYWHERE. Valet was full as well. Pretty ridiculous when valet lots had spots but they weren't allowing you to park in them and wouldn't take our money for you to park in them for us. 

The best part was, right when the the drink I ordered came, my husband called me from the parking lot, so frustrated he said, come back out,  we were leaving because he cannot park the car and it was getting ugly out there. I explained what was happening to the bartender and told him I had to leave - all he did was hand me the bill. I was still expected to pay for the martini, and had I known it was $13 - it wasn't on the menu- I never would have ordered it!!! 

Even if he had just said, ""I am so sorry, I can't comp this drink for you, I can't believe the parking today, but I hope you can make it back here again,"" it would have made this sting less.  I understand they are a business and can't be giving free drinks out (esp priced a $13 a pop) and I get that. But I was so disappointed this happened and the guy had 0 sympathy! Instead he told me to take it outside if I wanted while I waited.  I said this is really great, paying for a drink I don't even get to have. Inside I was thinking, I would have enjoyed burning a $20 more. My husband was waiting right outside for me after forever trying to find a spot -  I wasn't going to make him wait any longer or take a glass outside the front of this place! I gulped down a few swigs while the bartender ran my card and had to leave it.  And I still tipped him, since he did have to make it. 

Thanks CF, your lack of empathy really let me down today after all hassle, the gas and tolls it took us to get there today for nothing but money spent and a few sips of a cocktail.  Shame on this mall for such horrible parking today and roping off lots people could have parked in!!!

Sure, there's multi-million dollar homes, an incredible beach, and State Street (the main drag with a hundred cool shops and restaurants), but there's nooks and crannies to explore -- I find new things each and every time I go.

Things to do: 4/5
Safety: 4/5
Cleanliness: 4/5

STATE STREET -- For 1 mile from the ocean/pier, more than 300 shops and stores and 160 restaurants should fill your need for adventure.  You can also catch a ride on the electric shuttle for 50 cents, but I recommend walking it if you can.

THE PIER -- Stearns Wharf, check it off your ""wharf bucket list"" with its small touristy-from-hell shops and a few overpriced average restaurants.  It is also like the oldest wharf on the planet.  Wooden planks from the start to the end, aligned with feces all-along the railing (watch it when looking over).  Wharf parking allows for 90 mins free (with validation from one of the shops).  Parking is available with a block or so walk.  PS.  I don't like it, can you tell?

BEACHES -- There's lots of ocean, and therefore, lots of beaches.  Homes take up some of it, but there's a lot of small beaches that are beautiful -- I encourage you to explore and find your favorite.  The common one for tourists is around the pier, across from many hotels.

RESTAURANTS -- There's many wonderful restaurants here.  When I come here, I tend to go to more casual restaurants but no short on taste: Arigato Sushi (sushi duh) and Hoffmann Brat Haus (brats duh, plus other sausages and German brews).  Wine Cask was fancy and pricy, but great.  Great Mexican food here, and lots of them.  You'll start a fight with locals when picking the best.

COLD SPRING TAVERN -- If you have the time, checkout Cold Spring Tavern off Hwy 154.  It's hard to find and you have to drive, but it's an old stage coach stop that has wonderful food and atmosphere.  Go on a Sunday at noon for outdoor BBQ tri-tip sandwiches, a meal at the fab restaurant, or nightly at the bar for live music.

BEST FROZEN YOGURT EVER -- Mission Street Ice Cream and Yogurt at 201 W Mission St, features McConnell's Fine Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt (btw, the former name).  The ice cream is amazing, but the frozen yogurt is the lightest and creamiest thing you've ever tasted.  This location is the only one in the nation that I know of.

BEER & WINE STREETS -- Off State Street & Haley is very worthy of your time with breweries, and State & Anacapa has wineries (but both have both).  Additionally, you'll stumble across others within 6-8 blocks.  Use Yelp to score more.

HOMELESS -- It's a little ridiculous just how many street folks are here.  I guess they like it, too!  Great weather and what-not.  Seriously, lots of good folks are addressing the issue, but it really needs to be dealt with from PR to safety concerns (for them, and us).

TOURS -- I can recommend Taste Santa Barbara Food Tours, a delicious and historical excursion thru the streets of SB and trial of 8-10 places along the way.",2019-03-11 16:08:29

I arrived with a larger group of 14 (reservations made in advance) at 6:15 P.M. for dinner.  We found out very quickly that our unfortunate young waiter had the entire place to himself...I should note that he also mentioned it was his first night.   Ok, understandable...we will cut him a little slack.  He did take drink orders (~15 mins. after we arrived) and proceeded to bring them out one by one.  One person asked for the wine list (not provided to us initially) and ordered one glass of wine.  Ten mins. later, no wine but our waiter took appetizer orders.   We received them about twenty mins. later, and then asked to place our dinner orders.  We did so...still no wine, though.   When our friend inquired, the waiter tells us that he has no liquor license to serve.  Apparently neither does the manager (?) who is now helping to run food and drinks out, as one member of our party asked him why our waiter was working alone.  The only person who can serve the wine is the chef...whom we can see working very hard and appeared to be alone in the kitchen.  After the third request, the wine was finally served by the chef who came out from the back hurriedly to drop it off.   The manager did come around and offer us refills on other drinks during our wait; he did what he could with a friendly demeanor.   We received our salads after another measurable amount of time. After another wait, our dinners then arrived.   Then yet another delay to pay our bills.  Most of our party ended up leaving around 915-930 P.M., thus making the entire experience around 3 hours long.
I do want to mention that despite our long wait, the food was delicious.  House salad had a light homemade vinaigrette which was very authentic in flavor.   Hummus was creamy and flavorful (although could have been served with more pita bread for the amount of hummus provided).  I chose the vegetarian dolmathes served with rice and Greek beans which was amazing.  All other party members also agreed the food was good, and this was my sole reason for giving 3 vs. 2 stars.  However, the service lacked overall and I truly felt badly for our overworked waiter.   By the looks of other reviews it seems this wasn't an isolated incident.   
I still want to love you, Hellas...I really do, but could you please up your service game?",2019-04-11 20:36:56

i decided to try a more exoensive organization in the hopes that the quality of the cleaning would be first rate and christmas was looming,  after having fallen ill for a few months, living with 2 men, my home was a mess but not terribly - except for deep cleaning,  i hired these people with high hopes.  3 maids showed up and i didn't even have then clean my entire first floor because i excluded the bedroom downstairs.. so, we are talking about approx 700 sqiare feet. 

not only did they take their sweet time (3 maids spent 2 hours) - they did a mediocre job at best.  my floor was left dirty & had obviously jusy quickly & barely passed a wet mop across it  leaving dirty.  they also lost or threw away the operaytional piece of my electric chopper rendering it useless & costing me $75 to replace.  

in fairness they do offer a 24 hour guarantee - so if i had called they'd have tried to send somevody out to rectify the matter.  however, it was the day before christmas for me - we had a celebration at our home the next day (the day before xmas eve).  having been sick,  no prsents had even been wrapped  so the word ""busy"" was an understatement.  since i was so busy the next day wrapping i just said the heck with it.  then, preparing the meal for saturday night - i remebered one of the few items left in the kitchen sink was the lid to my electric chopper & the key operational component to the appliance - gone - as was my 24n hour window guarantee.  and i've spent hours looking for iit at this point,

well, my guests ate late having to chop everything by hand & i couldn't prepare one of the dishes i wanted to because it called for ground ingredients which i was unable to do.  after the xmas rush i received a call to confirm the next week's appointment - which of couse i canceled,  here's where it gets really bad - as if my experience wasn't bad enough, 

the caller asked me why i was canceling and i told her,  then she places me on hold & the manager gets on the line & basically scolds and finally yells at me - yeah that's helpful.

she asked me why i didn't call within the 24 hours & i explained the situation above,  then, she rudely tells me they are now going to charge me an additional $60 because i elected to cancel,  of course i wasn;t happy about it & let her know i'd spread the word.  that's when she actually yelled at me & i had been completely calm.  as if i was ruining some spectacular reputation which, based on the reviews here is far from true.

conclusion:::  over the phone a pretty picture is drawb but live & in person - low quality sevice for the highest prices in the industry.  my advice - you're better off with a bargained price independent.  do not use this place.  i've used at least 3 other services way cheaper & they did a muchg better cleaning job!!!  ans thus 24 hour service guarantee they are so proud of..........it wouldn't have helped my electric chopper situation discovered over 24 hours later.  not to mention, just about every cleaniing service will come back out if you call them back right away - so it;s nothing to really brag about!!   it is a rip off so find someone else!!  i plan to warn as many peiople as possible and the manager - she should be fired!!!",2017-12-27 20:31:27

I decided to use our Groupon to celebrate the girlfriend and I's one year anniversary since, well, we're poor and yay for deals!
Since it was a Sunday night, we were able to find parking very quickly but beware if you visit this restaurant on the weekend. It is right next to Frenchmen street and parking in the Quarter/Marigny is impossible already, as we all know!
We had a reservation for 7 pm, and walked into Melange to be greeted by live music. Cool! Looking around, I noticed that the other patrons at this hour ranged from mid-late twenties to middle aged and older. There was even a family in there. Definitely a mixed crowd this early in the night. I would love to come back to this place on a Saturday night.
My girlfriend and I sat down and immediately noticed the cool vibe of this place. The ambiance is great. Our waiter (Thorn? Thor? IS THAT YOUR REAL NAME) did take a little while to come over and take our order, but the menu is small and it took both of us about ten seconds to figure out what we wanted.
I ordered a French 75 with cognac, since I had heard all about the good cocktails, and the wild mushroom pasta. My girlfriend had the catch of the day, which was amberjack over some mashed potatoes (I think).
My cocktail and our waters came out right away, which was great. The French 75 was fantastic! I really enjoyed it, so much that I had to pace myself while drinking it. Living in New Orleans has made me that girl at family functions, always the first one to finish her drink when everyone else is only halfway done. Oops.
My drinking capabilities aside, the only weird part of our meal was the timing. We were given bread, but then about 5-10 minutes later our entrees came out. It was fine, though, we didn't mind since we could use the delicious, crusty french bread to soak up our sauce. 
Both of our entrees were incredibly rich. This place must go through 100 pounds of butter a night. Not that I'm complaining! My mushroom pasta was good, but I am crazy about mushrooms (haha, not the magic kind. Usually.) and the cheese on top with the white truffle oil, mmmmmmmmmm. So good, so filling. I finished about half of it before I had to stop.
My girlfriend's fish was similarly rich, she had a hard time finishing it. She finished it anyway :) She kept going ""This is so goooooood, but it's so rich, my tummy hurts"" as she kept eating, hah!
We skipped dessert (we wanted to get some fro-yo, which turned into Creole Creamery, but that's another review).
The service was good, nothing spectacular, but everyone that worked there was nice and helpful. Our waiter was adorable, though I think he was a bit disappointed when we asked him to take a picture of us and he goes ""You guys are a couple?"" after I explained to him that we were from here but celebrating our anniversary. ""Well, you guys are a beautiful couple!"" Awww thanks, Thorn, you're cute!  
All in all, this was a great spot for a date, even though I chose the most unsexy meal possible (spaghetti is not good if you are trying to be suave and impress someone). 
I would definitely come back here, and I look forward to bringing my friends here next time we are on Frenchmen Street.",2012-09-24 15:33:01

She refused to taper my pants appropriately.  And so gave me something half way between a skinny jean and a bootcut, with uneven sides to each leg, and one leg was twisting noticeably to the left (this only happens when too much is taken from just one side of the pant leg, rather than evenly from both sides.  But I was paying for her to take in both sides).  After dropping off the pants the first time, I tried calling to tell her that I would bring in a pair of my other jeans to match to; so, to wait (because I sensed something wrong with her careless attitude, that it wasn't going to turn out well).  But no one answered the phone, despite multiple calls.  And the voice mail box is full.  So I looked at her hours online and planned to get there right when she opened, which would have been about 7 hours before the pants were supposed to be done.  I was worried about not waking up in time, so I couldn't sleep the entire night.  I dragged myself over there exhausted at 8am, and come to find that she was closed (her posted hours on her door are an hour and a half later than what's online).  Un-frickin-believable.  So I run errands to make use of the time, though all I want to do is go home and sleep.  And when I return, that's when I see the problems with the pants.  I asked her to fix them.  Though she gave a variety of excuses she ultimately said she'd widen the bottom and take it out from just the outside (so to compensate for the twisting).  On my way home, I called to make sure that she would do what was necessary so the twisting wasn't there when I returned.  But no one answered the phone.  I called another time.  But still, no one answered.  If the one leg is still twisting when I return, I'm not paying the extra money she quoted for bringing in both sides (one side had a more reinforced seem; so she quoted more to take in both sides).  I'll have to bring my pants elsewhere to be fixed.  Being that I'm going out of town tomorrow, and these pants were intended to go with me on the trip, I'll be all the more disappointed in this experience.

kWOV056bk3oS70xSFf8C7Q,jWlCnjIxq2Gx74jH4kBCQw,B3giIt4PJSB0HovorpHROg,4.0,1,0,1,"Honestly, I don't know why this place gets such a bad rap... I'm not one for reviewing. In fact, this is my first Yelp review, but after seeing all the poor reviews on here I felt compelled to post something.

Here's the thing, I live in Soulard and this is one of my go-to pizza places. I order here regularly (probably over 15 times now) and they've never mis-quoted me on the delivery time. Never. I'll be honest, the people when you call aren't the most personable bunch and the same guy never seems to remember me, but that doesn't really detract from the quality of the food, the fact that they deliver late into the night and that the food gets here when they say it will. Let's face it, taking delivery orders isn't necessarily the most thrilling job in the world, so I can't really blame the guy for wanting to get the hell off the phone. The delivery drivers kind of creep me out, too... but hey, at least they're making a living.

As for the food, it has ALWAYS shown up on time and it's always fresh. I've never gotten back into my apartment to find they've effed up my order or that the food is cold. Seriously.. never. The pizza is a greasy Brooklyn style pie and it's the bomb. The cheese is high quality and the crust is homemade and doughy. I normally stick to cheese or pepperoni, because that's what I would get in NY. If you're the kind of person who throws onions and peppers, etc. on a pizza like this well, YMMV and I can't speak to that. The Bosco sticks (cheese filled bread sticks) are always too hot to bite into when they show up, that's how fresh the food is... and if you've ever had Bosco sticks I'll let you know that they deep fry them which is definitely they way to go. The wings are good, too, even when delivered.

Honestly, there aren't many bad things to say about this place, I just want my review to actually show up on their Yelp page and this is my first review so I'm docking it a star so it looks more realistic... And they could try to be a little bit friendlier when you're calling in for the ~20th time. Just saying.

In summary: this place is good. One of the best late night pizza places in St. Louis. I'm sorry if you've experienced otherwise.",2015-08-19 04:20:56
OnlbXZ3quRje8HoZ0-48tA,FiOmqkFmKUWQcp7-Vp5hpw,qTicP3qlsW6zqLV7P1Uz_g,4.0,4,3,3,"Thank you Yelp. After seeing the The Local Yelp, we decided to give the Eastern Peak a try.

What a nice place. The decor is elegant with large windows that provide lots of natural light in the summer evenings. In the 90+ degree heat, the interior was cool and comfortable. The staff is very friendly and downright jovial. This is a new place, and yet there were none of the hiccups you might expect in a new place. Things went quite smoothly.

In fact, this place is so new that the bar had JUST opened. I ordered my own, simple, but unusual highball recipe, and they did a stellar job. Little did I know that I had the honor of ordering the very first drink ever to be served from the bar! See the attached photo of the manager and our server proudly presenting my drink.

The food was quite good. We started with a Red Dragon Roll and I ordered off menu asking for a Hamachi Roll. The prices seemed a little steep until the rolls arrived. They are HUGE - easily twice the size of your average rolls. The Red Dragon was a delicious variant on a spicey tuna, and the Hamachi roll was perhaps the fanciest I have seen, with pretty black and red tobiko on the outside. It was quite delicious and the snap of the tobiko was a nice addition. The fish was fresh and the presentation was very good. All of the plates and dipping bowls were beautifully glazed pottery.

For our main courses we shared the Spicy Crab Salad and the Basil Duck. 

The Spicy Crab Salad is an entree salad served with a beautiful avocado rose set atop a bed of crab meat which in turn was atop a generous bed of mixed greens sprinkled with edamame. The dressing was slightly sweet and a perfect accompaniment to the crab, avocado, and greens. Really, the combination of the spicy crab, mellow creamy avocado, along with the greens and dressing was a gastronomic delight! The salad also had some glazed pecans in it. My niece thought they were delightful, I thought they were a bit of a distraction. Follow your own taste preference. Distraction aside, this is a really wonderful salad. 

Speaking of salads, the duck came with a house salad. Ready for your typical Asian restaurant iceberg lettuce salad with a cup of water in the bottom of the bowl? Not here! This was a nice mixed greens salad with radish slices and ginger dressing that makes me want to compare it side by side to my favorite -- the dressing from Sonabana. 

Finally, the Basil Duck. I am a sucker for Thai duck. Whenever I see it on the menu, I order it. I love the duck at Jasmine Thai. I even like the duck at Lemon Grass. The duck at The Eastern Peak is in a class by itself. This is perhaps the best Thai duck dish I have ever had. One of the things that makes it stand out is its simplicity. A boneless duck breast cooked medium-well (next time I ask for medium rare) sliced and plated on a bed of sauce and then covered with stir-fried peppers, onions, mushrooms, and of course basil. Even though the duck was a bit more done than I would prefer, it was moist, tender, and full of flavor. I asked for very spicy. It could have had a bit more heat, but my mouth was very happy. I got the fried rice with the duck, and it was very simple with just a bit of finely shredded veggies in it. However, there was some spice or flavoring that seemed quite unusual and yet familiar. Usually in a Thai place, a nice, but unidentifiable, savory umami flavor is going to be fish sauce, so that is my guess here. It was delicious and really went well with the duck, but unusual in your average side o' rice. Definitely give it a try!

A generous dinner for two, with drinks, topped out at about $100. Worth every penny.

So, in The Eastern Peak we have a really nice addition to Nashville's food scene. There are quite a few Thai + Sushi places in town and some are very good. Some claim to be ""Asian Bistros,"" yet serve very standard fare. The Eastern Peak does not talk that talk, but they walk the walk. They serve Asian cuisine with flair in an elegant, upscale setting.  It is certainly not ""authentic."" However, it is a creative reimagining of Asian cuisine that delights.

I look forward to going back.",2016-08-27 04:30:49

Again waited 7 minutes for a cup of coffee while people after me got served if the cashier would not have stopped and made my coffee it would not have gotten done the chick by the drive up window was doing nothing but sipping her orange juice and standing around looking. Then every day the tables at 6:00am are filthy every single day it's a disgrace. While they are standing around doing nothing but chit chatting with each other clean the tables PLEASE!!!!!! 



4-11-16 a record breaking day it took them 10 minutes to make one iced coffee there were four people behind me that got food and drinks before I got my coffee this place SUCKS!!!!!! Where the hell is a manager they ignore you and worry about drive through they should have a timer on the counter so people behind the counter we get served as quickly as people at drive-through get served this is every day I wait 5 to 10 minutes for one cup of coffee and my father as well. 

Well today I paid for my coffee at 6:31am and stood there while all the people in the line after me was waited on the woman filling orders said I'll make you coffee however she never did once the cashier who has no clue how to make a iced coffee did at least make an effort and did it I swear this McDonald's is a joke with their customer service they are all about welcome to McDonald's but then they SUCK!!!!!!

Wow I though things were changing I got my coffee very speedy the other day but sadly. We are back to waiting on 4 customers or more behind me to get drinks and food and I have to ask where my ice coffee is and I get a very estranged look from counter chick and she says with an attitude I'm getting it now so I said yes but once again only after every customer behind me gets served food and drink and again I get that estranged look from counter chick.   

6/22/16 the female manager here today is a real ass does not have customer service unless your a male. She trips over herself to wait on them smiling and jumping through hoops I come daily and she is almost always got a nasty attitude. But karma is a bitch because she got pissy because my ice coffee was basically almost all cream and no coffee so she takes it bitching about me to a coworker loud enough so I could hear when she went to add more coffee to drink the hot coffee go all over her pants and shoes that's what she gets for being nasty.  

6/28/16  once again filthy tables greasy hand prints water on the bench no reason I had to ask to have tables wiped off at 6am come on the lobby has been closed all night your not going to tell me that they were slammed all night NO! And I went to the register to order my coffee there is a woman standing at the end of counter (Kesha) now I hear these women talking across the Restruant so loud we in the front of business can hear them. Well I continue to stand there looking at me I then all of a sudden I barely heard may I help you over the noises in the Restruant I know she was being a smart butt because when I left the counter all of a sudden she found that mouth oh and by the way that same person has her child in lobby and asks a customer to keep an eye on her.

On a Saturday.  It was packed BUT lines weren't too too bad {I would say the longest was 20 minutes}. My kiddos are 4 {and super petite -- 30 lbs} and 6 {exactly 42 inches tall}.  There were PLENTY of things we could do as long as I was with my 4 year old. I did allow my son to go off on his own for a few rides {while we stayed nearby}.  It was a HOT day and I recommend getting there at open and finding a SPOT.  Otherwise you'll end up in a spare part of the grass. There was plenty of spare grass back near RIPTIDE and their new colossal ride.  But if you want chairs, definitely get in and get it ASAP.   I didn't score a chair until near 5 PM.

Since it was our first time, we did get off to a slow start.  Now that I've been I would personally head towards the beachy area for the relaxing slides.  There are two that me and my daughter enjoyed and could do in under 5 minutes and 3 slides that my son could go do on his own.  Everyone was overall polite and when we had questions, staff was excellent in being helpful and knowing the rides.

My tiny daughter did an oversized tube ride {Aruba Tuba} with her life jacket and LOVED it.  She didn't meet any height restrictions but as long as she was wearing a life jacket and could maintain the position, she could ride things.  She wasn't as outgoing as my son so we kept it simple.  We LOVED the lazy river which is not so lazy in some parts.  It was crowded of course but we spent hours in it just swimming around with the crazies!

We didn't eat there ....I brought PLENTY of snacks and many had coolers. They do have to be a certain size, so it is possible to avoid buying food, which we did even though we were there for 7 hours!  I am happy to report my kids didn't die from not buying the junk sold and we were able to snack our way through the day.

This is an ACTIVE park.  With one watching adult, it is easy for kiddos to get lost, so definitely keep an eye on them if the park is packed.  I have heard from others that Mondays and even Friday mornings are better in terms of lines and being able to see your kids.

Tips:  

-- Bring your own towels, get there early and find a spot to land
-- Pack a small cooler and some snacks or a full lunch for a long day
-- Parking is $15.  
-- LOTS of sunscreen
-- There are lockers all over {not just at the entrance}.  Lock up your keys, valuables, phone for $10 
-- Be ready to stand in some lines especially for bigger rides on weekends.
-- Go on a weekday to avoid lines and go EARLY or stay late {as it got later, it definitely thinned out}
-- They have showers, bathrooms near entrance, so feel free to take a change of clothes.
-- Be patient and kind to smaller riders
-- Be patient and kind to everyone 
-- Call ahead to ensure they are not at capacity

ENJOY!",2016-05-16 12:40:05
hALJh9mCvUaKX4-dl0y2HA,aHWh8ZMBCvP14Ncm1xRQ2g,cPzy7aa9CsMB-EnZUlL_HA,5.0,0,0,0,"Review for Brazilian Wax- 
I chose to go to Eurpean Wax Center because I needed a bikini wax and they offer first-timers a full-monty wax for $21. The yelp reviews were good, so I gave it a shot. 
        It was great. I had Jessica do my wax. I've had these done a million times, but I appreciated that she told me initially that she was going to explain each step (e.g. ""Ok, now I""m applying a prep... Ok, now I'm applying a powder to give the fine hairs a good grip). This would be good for a first timer, who may be unfamiliar or nervous. 
      I'll just go over my experience, as it's a bit different than I've ever experienced before. They use a hard wax, meaning that they will apply a large swath of wax, let it cool, and rip it off, sans paper strips. I've had this method before and found it can be great or awful. The last bikini wax I had used hard wax, but since it is very close to the skin, the technician needs to not be timid about touching you, um, down there. My last tech (at a different salon)pulled it a little at a time, without holding any surrounding skin, and it was torture. Jessica also explained they have a unique way of doing their hard wax. You'll notice that it feels like she is coating the whole damn area and you're wondering how in the world she plans on getting it off. Simple: She'll rip it all at once. Highly effective, and she mentioned this was less painful, since the pain is spread out instead of localized. I have to agree. She goes over it twice to make sure she has everything, and even tweezed a few. 
     The other thing that is different about this method is that it is so, so fast. You basically get coated in 4 big areas, ripped, and you're out of there. I was amazed that it was so quick yet I could tell she really paid attention to detail, and was thorough. 
       Upon checkout, I found that they have deals where you can buy 9 waxes and get 3 free (this deal is only offered for first-time guests, so make sure you have some money in your account or a credit card, if you'd like to take advantage). The girl at reception, Amy, had the presence of mind to ask if I was a student (I am) and offer me an even better deal. This was impressive, since I'm 29 and don't necessarily scream college student. I loved my wax, and purchased the buy 3, get one free deal. My total for the whole shabang was $147.00 (including today)...which equals $29.40 a wax. Compared to the $80 I was paying before, this is a steal. The fact that it's fast and through is even better. 
      Also, a note on my waxer's personality....She was so sweet and will make you very comfortable. I'm kind of an old hand at waxing, so this isn't a big deal to me, but I can see how it would be for some girls. The fact that she is obviously so comfortable in what she does will make you feel completely at ease. The only thing to watch for is that you undress while she is still in the room. Granted, she'll be fiddling with waxes and whatnot, with her back turned, but most salons will leave you alone for a moment and step back in the room when you're in your snap on towel-thing. I personally don't care and think the towel wrap is unnecessary, but it might be disconcerting for someone who is shy or used to undressing privately. I personally prefer this over having to wait 5 mintues, while my tech chats at the front desk. 
     They have a few products that look promising, but they won't be pushed on you. I asked Jessica for more information about a particular serum, fairly priced at $25 for a 4-6 month supply...I checked out the ingredients and they are appeared to be quality products.  
   Booking was easy for next month (got the same day of the week and time). Additionally, when you book your fist appt over the phone, they get all the pertinent info they need, so you don't have to do that annoying 'show-up-fifteen-minutes-early' to fill out forms.",2013-03-07 19:36:33

I didn't feel comfortable calling him because  I never met him at the store, his Yelp account said he was from San Francisco and no other information about him. I told him his account looked fake and his reply was ""it came through Facebook that's why it looked that way""...what????

  I was not interested in speaking with him and didn't trust him, so I replied back saying everything with my phone is fine now and what I said on my review were the facts of what happened and it was the TRUTH. 

 There was an aterial motive of all Patrick's  messages.  He asked me to take down my review so I wouldn't ruin his business.  I continued to respond to his replies telling him what I said was the truth and that Yelp was available to give people a heads up about a business, good or bad and I wouldn't take it down.  People can think for themselves and have their own experiences, but Yelp allows consumers to express in details their experience(s) of a business, so I did.

This store said the battery in the phone was swollen and caused my phone to die.  The battery was not swollen as they/he stated (which Patrick W. never saw my phone, because he wasn't there at the time) because I took it to the Warrington store who said there was not any swelling of the battery at all...""that store misinformed you"". ""You're phone would have a huge bulge on the back of it if there was a battery swelling issue"", (my phone is completely flat).  ""It's really rare for that to happened to a Samsung S7 Edge, never heard of that happening, the ONLY issues I've seen and heard of were with the Samsung Note.""

 Then Patrick W. said, there must be something he could do so I would take down the review, ""give you some kind of account credit.""  I told him I wasn't interested and I wasn't going to take it down.   To prove my point about being clueless,  one of his responses talked about an IPhone not being normal to poweroff and not restart....I DON'T HAVE AN  IPHONE, never did,  I have an ANDROID which has always worked fine until the weird thing that happened that day.  Further more, he kept resending new messages through Yelp 6 times.  I kept telling him I will not take it down and to stop messaging me.

When I mentioned about past negative reviews I saw on Yelp after I left feedback he said   ""those are from past management.""  Maybe it's not the mangement , it's the employees or both.  I asked him 3 times to stop messaging me and he wouldn't stop, so I'm posting this now as he has been HARASSING me to take down the post and still trying to ""cover up"" this experience with a ""account credit.""  I told him my last message was my last,  but he kept it up,  so I had to edit this post.

They were WRONG, PUSHY, DISHONEST, SELL HAPPY and now HARASSING!  Patrick W,  please don't contact me anymore, I don't want your bribe and and I'm keeping the post up.   It is what it is, so learn from it and move on. 

Again, please do not reach out to me anymore.",2018-03-12 13:54:42

Being from NY, and also having sampled pizza from up and down the east coast, and some of the best restaurants, and having gone to culinary school, this was good stuff. First off, none of what I just typed matters except the fact that I'm originally from NY haha. Only because at the end of the day, you can go to any fancy smancy restaurant, go to culinary school, eat any pizza from anywhere on the planet, but you can only get a NY slice,  IN NY! Many try but none will succeed. The closest you can even come to succeeding is this, "" man that was the closest I've ever had to a NY slice"". Lmao!!! It is true. I wish they did half stars because it wasn't  a 3 and it wasnt a 4. I only give them 3 stars because it was falsely bestowed to me what I was getting, and my experience there. The pizza really is good. The sauce, the size, the dough. All really good, but when I went in there they talked about it like it was an actual NY slice. The lady at the counter was super chill, and the cook was as well. We shot the stuff for a second and I loved the vibe in there. Reminded me of home so much. The smell, the workers, the title of the restaurant. All great. I was truly expecting a legit NY slice. I had just got done with Mexican food like 3 minutes prior. That is how much I wanted to try this place. I got to the counter and ordered a slice of pep to give it the old ""college try"". I asked the lady at the counter if it was a legit NY slice. She said she was from NY herself so I put my trust in her when she said it was. Immediately I was stoked. Boom, paid the pretty lady and began to talk to the cook who was tossing dough. They were pumping slices out pretty fast so I didn't really see a reason to sit. My friends still weren't there from the Mexican restaurant we just left. So I'm waiting , and waiting, and waiting....and waiting. I start to see people I know ordered after me getting their slices. Being in the industry I start to think, maybe they ran out of prepared pepperoni pies, giving them the benefit of the doubt that they would actually prep  pepperoni pies, and that they had to grab a chz pie and trow pepperoni on it (like it is actually done) and bake it... idk. Like I said I was being positive because I really wanted this place to be what I was expecting. For an actual NY SLICE, I would sit through the entire establishment breaking into song and dance, if it's fresh LOL. So my friends now arrive and sit, so I decide I might as well sit too. Still waiting, I go up and ask about my slice, and the lady asks the name and I give it to her. By this time I know they forgot it. She turns to me and instead of just saying that, she lies and says it is on its way out. I'm not really in a hurry but it has been a while now. As sure as I am not a trump supporter that slice comes out in the time a slice takes to come out on a plate after I ordered it to go. Again not a big deal honestly. I get it in a box and go. She could have just given me the truth, ""Hey, I'm sorry I forgot your slice"", or ""sorry I accidently gave it to someone else, it will be right up. Here is a drink for your patients"".   Idk something other than a lie. You would be surprised how easily the truth will make things better. Okay.. that isn't even my biggest disappointment. Get on the street open up the box expecting greasy, thin crust, mouthgasmic, deliciousness, and what the **** is this Chicago style, thick, deep dish, pizza I'm staring at. Smh. I ate it.. hence why I say it is good stuff. But NY style.. NO SIR! Don't let the name fool you.",2017-11-24 17:12:58
Ja4bcsd0zoevARbSPtr8KA,_Ms4_wCYcoR-Y5uIPJC8zA,h1J_GWV5yZ-gXUtsplvI8g,2.0,0,1,0,"I would have given this place three stars but at the tail end of my journey and after spending 36 consecutive stays here I realized that one of the staff members stole 4 of my rings.  Yes I counted through all the articles in my luggage and someone from housekeeping had enough time on their hands to rummage through my velvet pouch that I hid in a dress and steal four of my rings.  I WASTED $5,600 here and that was supposedly the ""corporate rate"" or lowest discount the hotel could afford to give me and I found out I was supposed to have received at least TWO free beverages after earning platinum status for the length of my stay but one of the staff members only mentioned it to me the final week of my stay.  I also did not get my complimentary night but regardless I am very angry that no one was apologetic and no one seemed to genuinely care that $2000 worth of jewelry had been stolen from my room.  I have never had this much stolen from me ever in my entire life and I have stayed once in a while at motels or motel 6 during the busiest holidays here in New Orleans but not once until now was there this degree of theft.  If you choose to stay here you will be awakened at all hours because the walls here are paper thin since there is no insulation at all between rooms and floors.  You will hear noises from the rooms right next to you and you will hear the housekeeping staff rudely bang on the doors repeatedly shouting HOUSE KEEPING!!!  After housekeeping finishes each room they don't even shut the doors quietly behind them either so you hear slamming if you are attempting to sleep in.  There was one night when a couple of young college aged kids were in the room right next to me and they had friends banging outside their door screaming all night long so each time I called downstairs to complain the staff would give a warning and then the noise would continue all night with this party so I did not get any rest that night.  There is no excuse for this kind of service not in a four star hotel or a one star hotel.  When you book a room and you pay for a room you expect for your belongings to be safe .  You expect it to be a quiet place so you can get adequate sleep and rest.  You expect the staff to look out for your best interests and let you know you are due something ""free"" once in a while but that does not happen here.  They refuse to believe they have a thief at this location and down the road when enough people complain about missing items they might lose enough return customers.  I have a large dog and I'd spend hours at a time with her.  Obviously one of the housekeeping staff noticed my prolonged absences because it gave that person ample opportunity to steal my items.  I don't advice anyone to store anything precious here so I'd advise anyone wanting a room here to basically put their favorite items in a paid safety deposit box so that you won't end up losing your mind. I am heart broken and violated because one of my rings had been a gift from my mother to me and it had great sentimental value.  I am also angry because on one occasion one of the managers implied that I left a permanent stain on the carpet but when I wiped the so called ""stain"" with cold water it miraculously disappeared from the carpet because it was a fur ball from my cat and I got it out in less than 2 minutes.  No one even tried to see if the ""stain"" would lift with water they were just hoping they could charge me an additional fee of $150.00.  This place is a waste of money.  You will not be treated well here they simply do not appreciate their customers at this location and it's not set up for pets even though they say they are ""pet friendly"".    For the amount of money you will be spending you'd be better off renting someone's private condo for a week. Oh yeah a couple more things.  Most of the t.v. channels here have poor reception and some of the stations emit ""white noise"".  The Wifi is free however it's super super slow so it's aggravating and annoying to use.",2015-02-22 04:34:53
F1hs6MUftKOh8Ny_o4w7CA,_ufG-6QfPQyOg8wrH-6e2Q,Xm5Y6HYaIBYZnWbJjMCG5A,2.0,3,2,2,"This new restaurant has opened up in the Grand Villa casino located in the new Roger's Place.  We arrived around 7:00 expecting it to be super busy but when we checked it out, it would only be a short wait.  Since we just arrived, we decided to walk around the casino first.

When we decided to grab a bite around 9 p.m., there was a band playing on the little stage inside.  The music was quite loud and could be heard throughout the casino.  There were two couples ahead of us but we got seated within 5 minutes.  The ""lounge"" area looked small with the band.  I followed the hostess and was wondering where we would be seated since I did not see any empty tables.  She lead us through some glass doors into another room which seemed odd but I was happy since the music was so loud as I passed by.  This area had a few booths and tables with more room.  The music was still a bit loud since the wall did not reach up to the ceiling.

Our server came to the table immediately and took the drink order.  She disappeared for a while and another server asked if we were ready to order our food.  We wanted to give her our food order since we were starving now but she said she would find our server.  Along came another girl who took our order who was very friendly and efficient.  Then our first server returned with the drinks and noticed that our menus were no longer on the table and asked if we ordered.  I replied yes and she ran off to the kitchen like she was upset.  Most of the servers here seem like students, young and inexperienced.  I felt like the first server was competing with her co-workers since she was speed walking throughout the restaurant but the service was very slow.  It was disorganized with too many servers trying to help every table.  When it came time to pay the bill, she brought out two machines that weren't working!  We tried them both before she tells us they don't work!??  I really did not want to give any tip but thinking they just opened, there will be some learning curves.

The menu was two-sided, one containing drinks.  It did not offer as many choices as I was expecting for dinner.  There was lots of appetizers to choose from, a few soup and salads then the some hot items.  We had the Hey, Alfredo! which was penne with no meat for $13, tasted okay.  The Dip with Beef was also just okay.  The beef was a bit chewy and the portion could have been a bit bigger.  It was $15 and came with skinny fries.  The Match Burger was nothing special for $14.00, the meat was way smaller than the bun.  A table beside us had dry ribs which looked tasty and Match Nachos.  This was just tortilla chips with salsa, couldn't even see any cheese.  Sadly, this would not satisfy anyone's craving.

The washrooms are hidden in a corner and there are only two, both are unisex.  Weird, for the amount of people this place can hold, two is not enough.

If you sign up for the Player's card, you will receive points and a 10% discount.  Our server did not ask if we had the card and knew nothing about It.  When we asked her about it, she had to check on it.  We were not impressed with the experience here so not sure if we would eat here again.",2016-09-10 06:57:53

My boyfriend and I ate lunch here a few weeks ago. Long story short: pretty bad. The only high point was the wine list. They had a nice selection of Italian reds that were mostly reasonably priced. I love Italian wines and there really aren't that many places that have a decent selection. 

Our appetizer was a 'caprese salad' and a bruschetta. The bruschetta wasn't horrible, but it didn't blow my mind either. At least, it tasted very fresh, albeit a bit bland. The caprese was an embarrassment. The cheese looked and tasted like the block cheese by Kraft that you get at Fry's.  

Our entrees were equally disappointing. I got the fish pasta special, tilapia with penne and various vegetables. In theory, it wasn't a bad idea. I have been to Italy and especially some if the seaside towns have amazing seafood pastas that celebrate fresh ingredients that are quickly (but amazingly) thrown together. This was not that. The pasta clearly came out of a box. The sauce was super salty. The black olives were canned. Final straw for me was the tilapia. I guess it was the special because it was about to turn (or may have already). I found it basically inedible. Luckily, I was only working a half day so having a liquid lunch just meant I could head home for a mid-day siesta.  :)

My boyfriend had the pork tenderloin entree, also lackluster (although at least not nearly rancid, so there's that). The waiter had described it as being served with this amazing sauce with porcini mushrooms. What arrived was a skinny, overcooked, lukewarm slab of meat over mashed potatoes that looked suspiciously a lot like boxed potatoes drizzled in a thin sauce. We asked the waiter what happened to the mushrooms and apparently they are 'in the sauce'. 

Final note on service: our waiter was nice but absolutely clueless. He really didn't know anything about the menu or wine. We had to open our own bottle because he butchered the cork so badly. I felt bad for him- as we were opening our own bottle he kept looking over his shoulder at the kitchen with a distinct fear in his eyes. He mentioned that he didn't want to get in trouble with the owner like an abused kid that knows they're getting a beating when they get home from school. The manager was even worse. He admitted that he knew nothing about the menu when I asked what he would order. 

Just up the street, there is Michaelangelo's (Oracle and Magee) or Cafe Torino (La Canada and Lambert) where the food is fantastic, the service is great, and they actually make their dishes from scratch.

PS: I wanted to check this restaurant out in the first place because there was a talk thread on Yelp about how the owners were harassing anyone that negatively reviewed the place. I notice that the overall rating for this place has gone up since then but that many of the good reviews are from people that just joined yelp, have no friends on yelp, and have next to no activity on yelp. Beware. From the thread, it became apparent that some of these reviews are from either employees that have been asked to write reviews or family members... take it all with a grain of salt.",2013-10-15 03:20:30

The space is really beautiful, tons of natural light and on a great corner for people watching with good views of the campus arboretum. That being said, that's about the only great things I could see from this restaurant. 

My friend and I went here yesterday and were expecting the place at just before 10am to be swamped, but it looked like they had already had an entire full restaurant and were ready for their second turnover. There were only a few tables in the very large space filled. The hostess frantically greeted us and told us it would be a few minutes for them to clean off a table. Another couple with a small child entered behind us and were taken to a four top immediately. When we looked around, most of the tables were empty but covered in dirty dishes. There were only two servers, and no bussers to be seen. The hostess yelled at the bartender who was busy making drinks, and then the hostess ran around the restaurant frantically talking to people in the kitchen and then back to the bar and then to clean a few dishes off a table, and back to the hostess stand... she got us seated at a two top a minute or two later. And there we sat.
As we waited for water and drinks to be brought out I watched the hostess continue running frantically all over and the servers just sort of walking slowly from table to table talking to people. All of the empty tables remained covered in dirty dishes and no one came by to say hello or bring us drinks. My friend wanted to get a mimosa, but the menu only says ""Mimosas starting at $3"". When our server finally came around my friend asked what mimosas they had and our server had to go ask the bar. When she came back she said ""classic and watermelon"" so my friend ordered a watermelon. I tried a sip of her's and it was very good. It was only after receiving the bill we realized it was a $6 mimosa, and with no garnish or flourish, just simple watermelon juice and sparkling wine it was definitely overpriced (IMO). Secondly, I ordered coffee which was not refilled until after we were done eating and I specifically asked for more. The coffee was not the worst I have ever had, but was definitely burned and not great. Also, on a side note, it was super odd when I asked for a refill the server got me an entirely new mug of coffee and took my first mug away from me with some still left in the mug.

As for the food, my friend got the eggs benedict which visually looked very nice but the poached eggs were almost cooked all the way through. I got the Dutch Breakfast (it starts with a U on the menu and is a Dutch word) and it consists of 3 fried eggs with tomatos on top of multigrain toast covered in melted gouda cheese. It wasn't bad at all, except that my toast was barely toasted and there was absolutely no seasoning to speak of that would make it great. It was super underwhelming and simple. 

Our server never came back and checked on our meal, never offered to refill my coffee, and never asked my friend if she wanted another drink. I wanted to order a Pannokoeken to share after our brunch, but since we never saw our server I had no chance to order and then we didn't want to wait anymore to ask, so we just decided to get the check.
The restaurant never got much busier (a few more tables came and went in the time we were there, but there was never a second 10am brunch pop), and I couldn't understand the obvious understaffing in regards to bussers during UA move in weekend at a campus restaurant. 

I am so sad that this place wasn't better, especially for being in such a beautiful space and such a great corner. I hope this review helps shed some light on a customer's perspective for Sunday brunch, and I will be sure to keep an eye out for menu changes and improvements to gauge whether or not I'm going to make a return visit.",2018-08-20 16:42:20

The issues include: They use high pressure sales techniques that make the lowest price only good for while they are there. The sales manager promised one bag of cement per post and two in the gate posts. They did not even put in a full bag into each post and no extra in the gate posts. Scheduling the installation was also an issue. They were scheduled to come out Wednesday morning (so I cleared my work schedule to be available), but called at 8:00am to say they would not be there until just after noon. I called at 1:30 only to find that they would be here closer to 3PM, but it would be complete that day. The person arrived at 3:45 and promptly told me that they would be dropping off the materials and coming back the following day (which was supposed to be the first day of my vacation). The person unloads the materials and puts in 3 posts, which each had less than a bag of cement. They actually only dropped off 15 bags of cement for 24 posts. The next day I approached the gentleman about the lack of concrete in the post holes and he would not even discuss it and blew up at me yelling about the cement. This was a horrible experience and should not happen to anyone paying almost $4500 for a small fence. I tried resolving this issue with Kyle the sales person and Rich the office manager, but neither of them were concerned with addressing the issue. I was not aware of this prior, but they did explain that they outsource all of the installations and that I could deal with the workers boss. This was ridiculous as I did not contract with the other company. I spoke with someone at the other company and he said that he would be here on Monday to address any issues, but never showed up. Since I could not speak to the person installing the fence civilly I decided to remove myself from that moment and just let him finish. After the work was completed, I tested each post by tapping the base of it with a stick and most of them had air pockets (which really concerns me for the longevity of the fence) in the dirt and minimal cement to be found. One of the gates also has damage as well as one of the pickets. I reached out to the teams (fence outlet manager and the subcontractor) today, but not to my surprise, no one responded. This has been by far the worst experience that I have had working with a company on a home improvement project. Buyer beware.",2021-01-05 00:42:35

Back in April I took my car in because it wasn't functioning correctly. They looked it over and found  what they thought was the problem and fixed it. As I was driving home the check engine light came on in my car. I called and was thoroughly unimpressed with the response I received. I brought it back and found it was the catalytic converter. They were going to charge me an obscene amount of money to fix it so I let it be. Fast forward to October my car was acting up again so out of necessity to get it fixed I hesitantly brought it into Greentree, figuring I'd give them another try. I specifically asked the mechanic via email, written letter, and over the phone to THOROUGHLY check my car. I received a report that I would need about $3000 worth of work done. I asked him if he would go through each item with me so I could understand the enormous amount. He rudely agreed to do so and in an annoyed tone walked me through the problems. I specifically asked him if he thought it would be smart to put this money into the car or if I should just try to sell it now and see how much I could get out of it as I didn't want to dump $3000 into the car and wind up dumping another $1000 or more a few months down the line. He assured me they had thoroughly looked at the car and that it was worth spending the $3000. I wend ahead with the repair and 24 hours later as I was driving to work, guess what came on? The check engine light! I called Greentree and no surprise they took no responsibility for it and were angry at me for the light coming on saying it must have been something that came up since I picked it up 24 hours ago. I brought it in and they ran a test on it finding that it was the catalytic converters. The same problem that came up in April- had they checked that out in the ""through"" inspection they supposedly ran on my car? no, even through it was on their records. Their response? Oh we thought you had gotten it fixed by another mechanic. First off, the phone is not difficult to pick up and ask me about it. Second, you are my mechanic and have been for 3 years!! Incredibly frustrating experience. Very unprofessional, unaccommodating, un-through, lazy, and rude. I will not be recommending anyone nor going their myself any longer.",2013-10-22 23:41:14
Qc74rGbiggEXiS6dqg0tsA,6jjHo9Lilv3kTy87pm2ycw,ZyrxkJclWRCzoeSXL7eZ3w,5.0,78,28,72,"Rich Bonet opened this Lutz shop 7 yrs ago. Six months later, tattoo artist Will Anders joined him. Currently, Studio 54 has three full-time tattoo artists. Will works part-time on the days the shop is officially closed. And owner Rich handles the piercings. Rich is currently in training-- soon LASER REMOVAL will be a service offered here. The shop is officially open Noon - 8 PM Tuesday thru Saturday. 

Will (one of two artists recommended for my needs) brought back to life a tattoo created elsewhere almost a year to the day six years ago. Originally, the tattoo was not done well, & I exacerbated the poor workmanship by slathering it in moisturizer multiple times over many days immediately afterward & by unknowingly exposing it to direct sunlight. 

After securing an appointment for today's work via the shop's webpage, Will contacted me via text-- even on his off days/nights. He sent me his planned rendering of the design improvements. He then contacted me prior to the day of my appointment & responded to my inquisitive texts. (Even though I got my first & only tattoo six years ago, I was still apprehensive about THE needle:) He texted me one additional time-- two days before we were to meet. 

Due to state mandates, I was the only patron in the shop at the time of my appointment; for virus precautions, the outside door was kept locked. Will & I both wore masks; the shop provides one. He first sprayed down my phone, my driver's license, my debit card, my stress ball, & my hands-- you could eat off me, I was so clean. Lol. I signed a standard release form that inquired about my allergies & certain medical conditions. 

The room used for the actual tattooing was clean, aestetically pleasing, & it was very comfortable. It housed a tattooing bed. (I was in a chair @ the previous location.) There was also a TV-- see pic. 

Will worked steadily & well. He & his cool hair kept me entertained w/ talk on many different topics. I learned that @ age 15 (& to his mother's slight chagrin), he gave himself his first tattoo (Popeye), & soon after he battled (& beat) cancer. He's a most colorful man-- literally & figuratively. 

I learned that I am not a ""bleeder"" (yea), & I also learned how to properly care for my tattoo once I would exit the building. That would be reinforced w/ the goodie bag that was to accompany me home-- see pic. 

Once my tattoo was covered & payment rendered, I left...& left quite pleased w/ the vast improvements to my 2014 tattoo. Absolutely NO COMPLAINTS here! I even paid $25 less than what I had been quoted because the work was created quicker than anticipated. Nice! 

From start to finish (a two week period), I received TOP NOTCH service. I won't hesitate to return to Studio 54 (& Will) should I ever decide on tat #2. Thanks, Guys! I SO appreciate the excellent communication & artistry! The cake's on me :-)",2020-06-08 20:05:37

I cannot express the amount of stress I went through today(Sunday) afternoon for my lunch. I had received few good reviews from a couple of my colleagues for this place and wanted to give it a try for Sunday lunch with my wife. I had to drive 30 min to get there, I am not complaining here on the drive but want to emphasize the expectation i was setting. 
I arrive at restaurant and there is no one to ask me to my table. I moved around to find on my own after a couple of minutes of wait time and got 3 empty places. All were really dirty so I went to the reception to find a guy who can get me a seat. He seemed hardly interested in the customers and after a few min he cleaned the table. There were rice and other food stuffs on the chair but he did not bother to clean them up. I had to ask him twice and expected to move on and enjoy the food. 
To let you know I love to eat non-veg but for current period of 10 days(Navratri) I am only on veggies. The buffet had 5 types of chicken but could not find anything interesting in vegetarian dishes. Paneer and Dal were kinda dry and did not appeal. Samosa chaat was out of stock and Vada did not so good either by looking at it. Presentation was not good but I was expecting good food and moved on. 
Would not take much time explaining as I could hardly eat most of the food I took in my plate. 
I conveyed my concern to the owner and he tried to make up for my pain so far. He got chaat, mango lassi and Potato fry for us and I wanted to appreciate his effort. Neither of the food were near good or say eatable. Chola was no where it's supposed to taste like, tasted more of tomato soup with too much of salt. Potato was uncooked and above all the lassi was Sugar Syrup. Talking to my wife during this time was the only thing from not saying anything to them again.  We were still hungry and decided to get out of the place. 
To hit me harder the guy(same guy who cleaned the table for me) charged me for my complementary lassi. Can you believe this. 
Anyway I am never going back again and neither anyone of my friends.

For some reason we weren't compelled to come back until, as vegetarians, we got tired of eating the one thing on the menu of every other restaurant in DTSP that doesn't have meat in it. 

We came for lunch. My BF was on the clock but we came at 11:45, thinking we'd be able to get in and out with no trouble. There were only two other people in the place when I got there so I was confident time wouldn't be an issue. 

Our waitress, to be fair, was on her second day, but even still there were some things during the ordering process that shouldn't have happened. For instance, I asked her what their ""stak"" is made of. She hemmed and hawed but ultimately did not know. Had no idea. 

The souvlaki I ordered came with a choice of soup, salad or a side of fries. I was torn because the soup du jour -- crema de cippolini -- sounded good. I asked if I could try a small sample so I could make a decision and the waitress went back to ask. She came back and told me that the ""chef"" said, ""No samples: you either get it or you don't."" Nice customer focus, ""chef.""

Since I didn't want to gamble, I went with the fries. Ultimately I ordered the souvlaki and sparkling water. BF ordered the BLT and a ""craft"" soda. He asked the waitress which flavor most closely approximated a cola. Again she had no idea. He ultimately went with cherry. 

We thought at this point we were on our way to getting lunch, but we had three more visits from the waitress first! The first was to ask my BF if he wanted a white or wheat pita. Visit #2 was to inform me they had run out of sparking water the day before (note: there a Publix a block away - you couldn't pick some up?). I ordered tap water instead. Visit #3 was to ask me if *I* wanted a white or wheat pita. Really?

Thinking that at last we had completed the ordering portion of the program, we chatted while we waited for our sandwiches. Fast forward another 30-35 minutes, during which time only one more party came through the door, and I had to flag our waitress down and sternly inquire about when our food might arrive since my BF only had about 15 minutes before he had to be back to work. 

She retreated to the kitchen and returned with our food. Coincidence? We'll never know. 

The food:  pretty good actually. The chips are actually steak fries with garlic and parsley on them and were very tasty. 

My BF enjoyed his BLT although he felt the sweetness of the tomato overpowered the savoriness of the tempeh bacon. 

I also liked my souvlaki, although the spices used on the chikkn had a trace of sweetness like nutmeg or cinnamon that made me think it was more of an Indian treatment than Greek. Even still it was good. 

The craft soda? I don't know *what* it was but it didn't look or taste even remotely like cherry. 

Bottom line, I might go back and do take out (if I called ahead) but they need to work out their front of the house issues, pronto.",2015-10-09 23:53:24
klLiZKgdRhqjB8u2CT95OQ,fOlya64BlnYPMuzKqJIJ7g,yEVRdb-9sBqzRiPC5BxwWw,3.0,6,0,2,"Located in downtown Boise, Tupelo Honey is the 18th location of a small chain that started in Asheville, North Carolina in 2008. Tupelo Honey seeks to reinvent southern classics. I ate there for the first time on 11/25/19 with three friends. Although I didn't love everything I tried, I appreciate the creative menu, good service and well designed space. Tupelo Honey is one of the few Boise businesses that is ADA compliant. And for that alone, they should be commended. They have a dog friendly patio and even a special menu for your fur kid. They graciously provide blankets and hot cider for those who wait outside for a table. The decor is modern, eclectic, bright, warm and homey. I like that I saw hipsters eating next to families with small children.

We started with five appetizers, four of which are on the Happy Hour menu and available for $4 each, which is a budget friendly way to check out a portion of the menu.They happy with our menu also has a $2 Fried Cauliflower Taco. None of us cared for the Warm Pimento Cheese Dip. It was smoky but didn't have a hint of pimento.  Everyone but me enjoyed the Famous Fried Green Tomatoes. There was nothing wrong with the dish but I've had versions that I much prefer to it.  We all enjoyed the Fried Pickles, Mac & Cheese Bites and Crispy Brussels. Interestingly, the Mac & Cheese Bites were unexpectedly topped with the pimentos that the cheese dip was lacking. Of the appetizers we tried, my personal favorite was the fried pickles, followed by the mac & cheese bites.

Tupelo Honey has a drink menu that includes signature cocktails, as well as multiple versions of Bloody Marys and Mimosas. They also have a number of Fizz &Fruit drinks that you can add gin or vodka to. They even have a draft Kombucha. Pictured is a signature cocktail called Bees Knees, which was delicious. It consists of gin, honey simple syrup, lemon and a honey-droplet rim.

For entrées, two ordered the Shoo Mercy Shrimp & Grits. It was delicious, but all agreed that the addition of the egg was unnecessary and detracted from the dish. One ordered the Bourbon Peppercorn Glazed Meatloaf. The meatloaf had great flavor. I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken, a boneless and skinless ""forever free"" chicken breast that had been brined for 18 hours with milk gravy. For sides, I got collard greens with bacon, which were good but not exceptional, and Yukon smashed potatoes, which were a bit dry and needed seasoning. I thought the chicken was very good.

For dessert, I ordered the trio of Mini-Mason Jar Desserts, which consists of banana pudding; peanut butter mousse and chocolate ganache with salted pretzel crumbles; Atlantic Beach lemon curd custard with buttery saltine crumble and whipped cream. I was most looking forward to trying the banana putting and that is the dessert that disappointed me the most. The pudding was thin and did not taste like banana. The peanut butter mousse and chocolate ganache was too dense and sweet for my taste. The Atlantic Beach lemon curd custard was OK, but not exceptional. I would not order this particular dessert again.

One of my friends got a slice of the Brown Butter Pecan Pie with dark chocolate sauce to go. Another order the Honey Buttermilk Cheesecake with mountain blueberries to go. I have yet to hear the verdict on those two desserts.

All in all, we had a great evening and look forward to returning.",2019-12-21 12:12:56
MvZPm728r0Xt0TCcAPdL8Q,QZQLPBIlZP9UN7qvfr2YNw,nIlmZLuMs0JuBRvAHSIf8Q,1.0,8,0,0,"We were planning on using Bredenbeck's for our wedding cake, but after our tasting, there is NO. WAY.  

We made an appointment over a month in advance, and when we showed up right on time, we had to wait awkwardly in the bakery for over 30 minutes.  We were fine with that, but when the consultant came to take us to the tasting room, the first thing she said to us was that there was a couple coming in 30 minutes, so we ""had to make it quick"" -- in a tone as though we were walk-ins who didn't have an appointment, or as though we had showed up late. She also hurried ahead of us up the three flights of stairs to the tasting room (as though she had no time to wait for us to catch up), which broke my heart because it was so rude to my MIL, who was having a hard time on the steps. 

The tasting itself was a disaster.  Prior to the tasting, I spent no less than 30 minutes on the phone talking through what we wanted (I was promised that the tasting would be the chance for us to try that out).  The day of the tasting, the consultant just sat down, sans cake samples, and asked us what we wanted (um... to try cake?).   As we started talking about it, she told us one thing at a time that every. single. thing. that the original person had told us was not true.  Type of cake available, type of frosting, etc.  She even asked me if I was sure that I was right about my own wedding day, because she was certain they had it down as a week later (not very comforting). 

After we talked about what we would want for the day-of, she asked if we were good to go. I had to specifically ask if we could try the plate of sample cakes that I had seen her bring up to put in the refrigerator.  She begrudgingly got the cake samples out, and told us that they had been sitting out for a day, as if to explain in advance why they would be dry and not taste great.  She then mixed up the flavors, confusing lemon cake and vanilla (which inspired visions of that happening the day of the wedding).  

All in all, it was a total trainwreck.  I can only imagine if we went with them that we would be made to feel like an inconvenience while they delivered lemon instead of vanilla cake on the wrong day.  The actual mistakes and lack of professionalism would have been forgivable, if the consultant wasn't so rude to us. I felt bad that family drove almost two hours for this!  Really disappointed by the whole thing.",2019-05-09 21:53:37

I felt really bad because a lot of dogs in shelter needed a home too but I just couldn't help it.

I saw a cute 3 month old white Shiba Inu on sale and I've never seen a white one before and he was just so playful and sweet. I instantly fell in love with him. 

The girl and boy was very nice and talked me through the purchasing progress. Bought him . got his medical files. done and dealt with. Got him home. Even thing seems fine....

He was missing his last PV and rabbi shot so I immediately made an appointment to get his last shot. When I got to the vet, they told me they couldn't give him his shot. Why? Because he had kennel cough, giardia, underweight and dehydrated. 

I was very concern and annoyed. I didn't hesitate to get him fixed up but I was really unhappy about this. Giardia and kennel cough is contagious. I can only imagine how many other of their puppies could be infected. As well as knowing that a lot of the puppies are in cages next to each other and some can have a few of them at the same cage.

Another thing is people probably won't expect the extra $$$ to spend on getting the dog healed up. Because of these illness, I wanted to do a double check on his medical history. The vet that the owner brings them doesn't kept records (I called and double checked) of the puppies being sold here. So once they get checked up (if they even) that's all. I also checked the breeders information. My breeder was not registered with AKC. Neither did it turn out my supposed ""purebred"" Shiba Inu turned out to be a purebred at all.

Since they sold me a supposedly pure breed Shiba Inu, I expected to have all the paperworks in check. Sadly they were not. I contcted the owner about my concerned. He said he would compensate me for my troubles. After a few emails and replies, why is it that every-time when I forward the bill or fax it over, he never receives it? After months of trying I just accepted that it just wasn't going to happen. 

I love my dog. He's been such a positive influence in my life. But it hurts only imagining what he went through.",2015-10-26 22:39:23

As other reviewers have said, they seem to have closed down the previous Yelp page (which uses a different address) due to so many negative reviews. I wish I'd seen them before I picked up the phone and called these unprofessional, racist, abusive people!

First let me say that their contracted employees (Corey was the person I initially dealt with) were great, polite, friendly, and knowledgable. HOWEVER, Will, the owner, is abusive and has, for the past two days, been harassing me by text and by phone, swearing at me, calling me names, and making really weird comments/excuses for not showing up to the appointments we scheduled (""sorry, I oded on sleeping pills""). 

Basically, I was charged $335 on the day the contractor to showed up to order an oven display for my fried Maytag oven.

Nobody shows up on repairday, nor do they get back to me via text. Two days later, after exchanging a few messages back and forth, Will, the owner, texts me: ""we have a problem we lost the clock board so we can't fix it obviously"".

That was all. No further explanation, no apology, no attempt to reassure me that a new board would be ordered and installed. I wrote back asking how long it would take, and again inquiring with whom I was speaking. I said I was a little worried, as I was $335 out of pocket for a repair that had been reschduled numerous times by a business who had apparently ""lost"" a large, difficult-to-lose oven clock display. 

I received a message saying that he was sorry, that he lost the board, that he would get another one but it may take a week. I said that was fine, thanked him for the update, and asked whether I could receive 50% of my money back to be held until the installation was complete. I reminded him that this was something that had been offered on original consultation; I wasn't asking for a refund, just 50% of my money back as a security deposit. This is when he became aggressive.

He said he could not refund me even partially, but ""not to worry"" because he was ""a pretty honest guy"" who had ""been in business a long time now"" and ""believed in being morally ethical"". As you can imagine, after everything I'd been through, this wasn't very encouraging. I said I understood this but that I felt I should be given some sense of security after how badly the situation had been handled, and possibly a little compensation for wasted time/the inability to use my oven for over a week. When he said all he could do was come back and fix it, I let him know that if I didn't have an appointment booked to install the oven clock, I'd be calling my bank to cancel the check.

This is when he got very nasty. He texted and complained that he was ""out of pocket"" for having to reorder another part (not my fault--HE lost it), and that there was ""no way"" I could have any money back. Again, I remained polite and said that I didn't want a refund, just some financial assurance that the repair would actually be completed. He exploded at me, stating that I was ""never overcharged"" (I didn't say that I was) and that there was ""no way"" I was getting any money back. I responded to just please let me know when the part came in and when I could expect the repair.

24 hours later, he messages me saying he's been ""dazed and confused"" the past few days but has, miraculously, found the missing part. Um...?

We set up an appointment for him to come and install the part at 1pm on Thursday.

At 1.30 pm, nobody has shown up. I text asking for an ETA. Nothing.

At 2.21 pm he sends me this message: ""Sorry od on sleeping pill? Messed my whole day up! It will be Saturday.""

At this point I was just done. I told him I was going to call Chase and cancel the check, to which he replied ""You're check been cashed nothing you can do."" Called Chase anyway & started the process to recover my money. I let this guy know, at which point he left me a series of a",2015-11-19 22:54:44

I'll start with the good. The presentation is unique and very clean and the waitresses were very attentive, efficient and helpful. 

Normally that would be enough to get at least two stars, but in this case the point is moot since the food was for the most part over seasoned inedible slop.

I ordered the fried chicken with watermelon pickles, which, might I add is actually a plate of chicken wings. Don't get me wrong, a plate of fried chicken wings IS fried chicken, but I really think the menu should say ""fried chicken wings"" instead of just ""fried chicken"". They somehow smelled like raw, frozen chicken wings. They were either way over cooked, really old or both. The chicken meat was tough and fibery like wood. I could only eat two before I gave up.

My wife ordered the mini cheese burgers. She ate about half of one and asked me to try it. The meat was cold, I mean like barely thawed cold. We sent them back. 20 minutes later they brought out another order and it was a completely different burger!  It was fresh and had toppings, which the other burgers didn't seem to have. Unfortunately, the meat was so salty and seasoned that we couldn't taste anything.  Literally, we couldn't taste the onion marmalade because the meat was so salty. Combined we ate one out of the three burgers.

One of our friends ordered the North African Chicken which was perfectly cooked, but seemed like it had a cup of salt poured over it.  There was some kind of pink sauce poured over the couscous that was herby and tasty, but you had to eat it alone in order to taste it.

Our other friend ordered off menu, a shrimp and grits dish.  It was actually pretty good, well balanced flavor, textures and heat.  Not too salty at all.  In a way it pisses me off even more because apparently you have to order things that are NOT on the menu to get anything worth eating.  

For dessert, against my better judgement, we ordered some cupcakes.  Nothing special at all, you would be better off going to Winn Dixie.

All in all, I feel like we were suckered into going to a tourist trap because we all like Besh's other restaurants.

EYxue-T0FcnIur8eqo-gKA,3EMvGJv54k40Ee9KaSY1eA,qDkbudGRfmJvf7trQZea4g,3.0,2,2,0,"I had high expectations for this Steakhouse. I was neither surprised or disappointed. Walking in and being seated we were greeted professionally. Once seated, the hostess handed us the menu and told us that they will change out our napkins to black ones. Did we not deserve the white ones that were already on the table? I guess I did not understand why that was done, if anyone knows, please share.

We gone ahead and ordered from the classic menu for the lamb chops and the steak and lobster. Only one of it was the entire meal, the other was just an entree. Even though this was the case, they plated two separate salads and desserts for us. It was very kind of them. 

They left a glass out for the Pinot Noir that we ordered, and I found it a little amusing when the waiter came out with a little jar of what turned out to be exactly 6 oz of wine in it. The spring mix was very refreshing and even though it was split between the two of us, it was still a very hearty portion. moving forward, they brought out the side (sautéed mushrooms) and the two entrees. 

With the table as far apart as it was, and the waiter bringing out the food in a large serving tray, I expected the plate to be an accommodating size. It was not. It was a 12"" oval plate. This is not to say that they were skimping on the food, it just made me feel that the plate was a little cluttered. I had a hard time with the Lobster tail flopping all over the plate, and not having room to leave the shell on the plate. The lobster was encrusted with crab meat and it was good. The steak was also cooked to request and it was a decent piece of ribeye.

I tried the Lamb Chops however I did not like it. It was not the way it was cooked, I just probably don't like lamb. The dessert ended up being a Cinnamon Chocolate cake and fresh berries. The berries were glazed with a flan-like syrup. It was far, but the chocolate cake was a little dry for me.

The hand towels in the bathroom is quite fancy, it almost looked like a reusable handkerchief. I find it a little wasted and probably should belong in a 5 star restaurant instead.",2010-04-15 03:30:00
Q6taTKp9xaeEWARoWVTLAg,__T5RwFayOEXipna8KNQ-A,4rq1UBosWNXEAxj6qmBd6g,1.0,9,0,0,"We recently booked a move with Fry-Wagner from St. Louis to San Francisco.  In retrospect, I would have never picked this company given the series of issues that followed, resulting in major disruptions to our work and family lives.  If you don't read the rest of this review, here's the summary of our experience: Fry Wagner does a very good job up front to sell a service, but falls very short on execution.  It seems making a promise and not delivering (literally and figuratively) is a part of the company's practice.  The details:

After comparing quotes with other movers we decided to go with Fry Wagner because of the ""guaranteed"" delivery dates we were promised.  The move was job-related, and timing of the delivery was the most important priority to us, which we emphasized up front.  A summary:

1.  We selected a guaranteed dates option and our Fry Wagner Coordinator, let's call him ""Bob,"" very confidently assured us of the delivery dates in the beginning.  Two days after our move we were notified the delivery would be delayed, but they could not give us a new date.  When I asked ""Bob"" for details, he was very dismissive and blamed United Van Lines for not having a driver available for our shipment.  I got the impression Fry Wagner had not verified if a driver/truck would be available when they ""guaranteed"" my delivery, and got me to sign a contract under a false promise.  Seems an awful lot like a bait and switch operation, and reading through prior reviews I now realize this may be a pattern for this company.  I regret not having read through prior reviews before picking Fry Wagner.  

2.  ""Bob"" never got back to us with an update and I asked to work with his manager and his Sales Manager ""Garett"" took over.  To his credit, ""Garrett"" had more information to offer, and basically told us there was now way we would receive our delivery by the guaranteed time.  He said he would work with United to get us our belongings soon, but ultimately our things arrived almost 2 weeks after our promised date.  

3. During the delay my family only had the belongings we had brought in our suitcases from St. Louis to San Francisco.  For the past 2 weeks we've been sleeping on the floor, with no real household belongings to speak of.  We have a 4 and 7 year old, and you can imagine the difficulty of this situation, especially when moving into a new city.  The delay has also caused disruptions in work for myself and my wife, pretty bad when starting in a new job.  

4. ""Garrett"" finally got us a new delivery date.  This was a relief, though the execution was botched and there were more problems during the delivery.  

5. Given the move from STL to SFO, we downsized and split up our belongings between an apartment and a self-storage unit.  In St. Louis we painstakingly separated out these items, and Fry Wagner was conscientious about labeling things properly.  Fry Wagner was supposed to split the shipment into 2 smaller trucks (one for storage unit, the other for our apartment) for efficient delivery.  ""Garrett"" confirmed all this the day before delivery, however this never occurred!  

6. As the delivery had not been split up as planned, all our belongings arrived combined in one large trailer and had to be split up on our move-in day.  Move-in was supposed to occur over Saturday, but ended up lasting the entire weekend.

7. The parts box (box with nuts, bolts, etc, for our furniture) was packed away by the Fry Wagner crew inside our furniture and could not be found when our movers in California tried to re-assemble the furniture.  It is common practice to pack the parts box separately in a clearly labeled box and load it last into the truck (so it comes off first and doesn't get lost).  Luckily, the California team (Crown Worldwide, reviewed separately) found the box and returned to re-assemble our furniture.   

Our ordeal with Fry Wagner still isn't over.  As of now no one has unpacked our TVs (we paid for packing and unboxing and Fry Wagner was supposed to send out a 3rd party service).  Also, no one from Fry Wagner has been in touch regarding the claims process (delay in delivery, damaged furniture, etc).  

I would not recommend the company to anyone I know.",2018-08-06 19:24:00

The schlep from 15th street did promote some reluctance but I finally sucked it up and made the trek this past Friday evening. 

I did make a rez earlier that day (like an hour before) bc I'm not keen on waiting but I don't think it was required. After some confusion regarding actually entering the building at the right place, we were seated. It was actually freezing cold but that might have been my fault for under-dressing (in my defense it was like 8000 degrees outside). I will confess that I have a temperature comfort range that spans approximately 1.5 degrees. 

I would also like to point out that I think the pre-meal table bread is a pretty critical component of the Italian restaurant meal but was however absent at this place. 

There's a bunch of shit that looks tasty on the menu, including cocktails and food. We spent a significant amount of time deliberating about both what we were going to order and who was going to decide. Final decisions included verde salad bc I'm a brussels/fava bean bitch, pesto bc I'm a pesto bitch, and eggplant pizza bc it's what my GF wanted and who am I to say no to that gorgeous babe. 

This restaurant as the option to make many of the dishes either vegetarian or even vegan, which is clutch. I asked for the verde salad vegetarian and when the waiter brought it over he said ""without the bacon"" or whatever meat comes on it but the dressing has anchovies.... Luckily the anchovy-y/oceany flavor that petrified me was not present but unfortunately neither was flavor in general really. This was a bit bland but I ate it bc I was hungry and it was in front of my face. 

Pizza was really good but pizza is hard to fuck up. There was like maybe 4 little circles of eggplant which is fine bc I'm not like head over heels about eggplant in the first place. I'd definitely try more pizzas from here tho. The pesto was really delicious. I crammed every last noodle into my stomach 2/2 its tastiness.

The restaurant is a small establishment that is tucked away on Tampa road in the same strip mall as Queens Pizza and a Shell station. 

Atmosphere:
When you walk in you feel like you are walking into a humble Japanese restaurant. Along the right wall are booths that allow you to sit on pillows and a low table. Down the center is a long banquet table that can hold a large party or several small parties. A great community table. The left side has typical chair and tables. Towards the back is a well lit and modest sushi bar. 

The owner, Duke, is personable and is honest about his portions. He had the opportunity to sell me more food than I needed but said that the dish I ordered should be filling for one person. 

The food and people that work there are well liked. I was the only one that wasn't a repeat customer. Duke and the waitress (didn't catch her name, she too was know and liked) knew their customers' names and food preferences. By the end of my dinning experience they were calling me by my name. 

Their customer service is so exceptional that Duke made a mistake on a to go order and told the customer that if it should ever happen again call and he will bring the correct order to her. WHAT!!! Amazing!

Food: I ordered gyoza and okonomiyaki. 

The gyoza was delicious. The meat stuffing was well seasoned and balanced in flavor. It was moist and not chewy. The wrappers were delicate in texture but didn't easily fall apart. They were cooked perfectly, steamed and pan fried so that you get the juxtaposition of soft wrapper next to crunchy wrapper. 

The okonomiyaki was huge! The pancakes/ crepe like wonder was packed full of flavor. The edges were crispy while the center was soft. They included cabbage and seafood. It was topped with eel sauces, mayo, seaweed, sesame seeds and bonito flakes. I tried to finish it but I could only eat half (next time I'll dine with a friend). I highly recommend this as an appetizer for a group of 2 to 4 people.

I look forward to trying more dishes!

Cost: 
Gyoza $ 6.5
Okonomiyaki $ 10 or 12 (can't remember)

There's is still time for you to book somewhere decent. On the way into town I saw a Hampton Inn west of downtown. That place would probably be fine. If you need convincing not to stay here, you can read below about my experience at the Ramada this past weekend:

The price: This is the one slightly positive thing about the Ramada. At around $100 night, it was relatively cheaper than the Silver Legacy or Circus Circus which were both around $200 when we were looking up hotels. In absolute terms though, you'll be annoyed that you paid $100 a night to stay at a dump.

The location: Driving up to the hotel in the mid-afternoon, the first thing that I noticed was a scraggly-looking man in his 30's walking across the parking lot with a small TV wrapped in plastic in his arms. It was pretty clear that he probably didn't purchase that TV. In the parking lot, there are bold, eye-catching signs every two or three parking spots that unambiguously state that they will not be held responsible for anything bad that happens to you or your car in the parking lot during your stay. It's not a good sign that they have so many of these signs. 

Even though the hotel is located less than a mile from downtown, I would not recommend walking outside the hotel at all. On the short five minute drive from downtown to the hotel that night, we saw one fight and two other police situations. All throughout the night, we heard sirens from the streets. You will not feel safe in this part of town.

The lobby: Walking to the lobby, we were immediately hit with the stench of decades of cigarette smoke residue. Everywhere in Reno is like this though so I'll give them a pass on this. 

The ""casino"": Everything about this ""casino"" (finger quotes added) reeks of sadness and despair. Slack-jawed, red-eyed zombies sit slumped over in front of slot machines smoking cigarettes and drinking cheap beer. The combination of smoke and poor lighting creates a haze that made me feel like I was in a bad dream. I had walked into the ""casino"" because I had a coupon for a free drink. However, the bar was filthy so I just got a bottle of water because at least I knew it would be sanitary.

Cleanliness: We put our bags in the bathtub, because we were worried about bed bugs getting into the bags. That should be all you need to know about our assessment of the room's cleanliness.

Noise/light pollution: There was a super loud fireworks show in downtown Reno at midnight which sounded like gunshots from our room. Not the hotel's fault, but maybe just another reason not to stay in or near downtown Reno. Something that was the hotel's fault: the side of the building is covered in flashing white lights that flash into your room as well. We had to use the blackout curtains to keep the light out. 

Service: Awful. Our bed only had sheets and no comforter. There was also no additional sheets anywhere else in the room. We called the front desk at 11:30 and asked if they could bring up some blankets. The employee at the front desk said that she was ""busy"" and that we should go down to the front desk and get them. 

In the morning, the housekeepers knocked on our door (loudly) at 8 am to ask if we were checking out. Someone had already slipped our bill under our door, so the hotel already had to be aware that we were checking out. The housekeepers should have known this.

Amenities: With the shower, I had the option of warm water or acceptable water pressure. I couldn't have both as the hot water knob was jammed (perhaps intentionally to limit hot water usage, but maybe that would be giving them too much credit).

Verdict: If I am comparing this hotel to all other $100/night hotels existing in America, this place would be at the bottom of the list. Given what we saw of downtown Reno during our trip there, this place might be worth the savings. The Silver Legacy and Circus Circus seemed super horrible as well. None of these hotels paint Reno in a positive light. 

Based on our experience at the Ramada, we would not return to this hotel and probably not even to Reno.",2017-07-31 04:25:37

My friend, Jamie B., was so excited to share Bacio with me, and after tonight's meal, I can fully understand. My heart and stomach are happy with love. 

Bacio is a charming and quaint neighborhood restaurant that maybe seats 40? The walls are a warm red and over the din of diners and kitchen staff pours a soundtrack of standard Italian favorites. I think I sang along to Nessun Dorma three times! (I am so not a tenor.) For being a Sunday evening, they were hopping. I was so glad they were able to seat us without a reservation--they had a lot of larger parties, including one referred to as VIP (just like Pamela Anderson.)

Before our server even greeted us tonight, the chef, and later I learned owner, offered us a sample of a dish. After we told him we didn't eat shrimp, he didn't even hesitate before offering that he could make it without. What it was, was a dish of white beans, arugula, and magic. With the first taste, I knew I was in for an amazing meal. 

I settled on a cup of the Pasta e Fagiloi soup--both their Minestrone and Pasta e Fagioli were Vegetarian--double bonus points! For a main course I had the the Vermicelli and Vegan Meatballs. I'm not a Vegan, but I was happy to have Meatless Meatballs. Jamie had the Minestrone, an Arugula salad with apples and a pomegranate reduction, and the Eggplant Parmesan. Bacio is BYOB so we also served ourselves nice tall glasses of Syrah straight out of my bag. 

The soups were both perfect. The Minestrone had a lovely blend of fresh vegetables and homemade pasta and the Pasta e Fagioli paired white beans and homemade pasta in a lovely vegetable stock. My main course was a generous helping of homemade Vermicelli--they were making pasta on the other side of our table in the open kitchen--topped with a thick and flavorful Marinara and three huge Vegan Balls. That sounds dirty. Regardless, they were also hugely full of flavor that paired like Cagney and Lacey with the Marinara. And this was so much more than a scoop of red that many restaurants offer. It was also topped with cuts of fresh basil.

I love that they were even so considerate to offer a Vegan topping (think Parmesan cheese) with my meal. When I told the server I ate cheese, she was pleased to gate fresh Parmesan upon my mound of deliciousness. On a side note, the menu was really Vegetarian/Vegan friendly, which I think is awesome of them to be considerate. Sure, you'll think it's Italian, it can't be that hard to be Vegetarian/Vegan, but really, this was rock-your-world awesome. Other options included a sweet potato gnocchi, a ravioli, and a Vegan Lasagna. 

Following dinner, we somehow decided we still had room for a slice of cheesecake after our energetic explained it was ""out of this world"" to another table. There's always room for dessert, right? I am so happy we went meatballs to the wall with it and ordered it. The chef, who was right across the half-wall in the open kitchen, explained that it was his mom's recipe, who also was there this evening. I'm so sad she must have left before I was able to commend her on her dessert. This cheesecake looked like it was going to be heavy, but in all actuality was quite light and fluffy--it almost had a flan/custard like quality with a perfect, non-graham crust. 

Bacio has set a new standard for Italian fare for me. I swear this dinner was a nearly religious experience. I love that the owner/chef talked to us through the entire meal and was always smiling; it's refreshing to see a chef take such pride in their work. This meal was perfection.

If Valerie ever makes it to Philly and visits their restroom, she will notice it is a unisex one stall and it smells like bubble-bath. I thought it was pleasant, and really, if there's only limited seating, one stall should be adequate.",2011-05-16 02:17:59

I will not name him because that is just not who I am, but I have to say I feel totally scammed by this guy.  I spent a lot of my valuable time trying to get this shed design right. Visited the office to look at materials, sizes, etc.  He was very nice and accommodating at that point.  He even stopped with the sales harassment emails and texts to get the sale after I had enough of them and asked him to stop.  He appeared to be a great sales person. I finally figured out what I wanted and he sent over the contract via docusign.  I signed it with my actual signature because I have a touch screen computer.  The following Tuesday, Feb 9th, I go in to put down the deposit.  He is messing around on his computer and I noticed he had added $371 dollars to the amount that was on the contract I signed.  He goes on to say that he had not added the taxes on the contract I signed before. I told him I had not agreed to that amount and he proceeded to tell me that if I didn't want the shed I didn't have to take it...in a very condescending tone. Now I have been in the service industry for 13 years and know you never get an attitude with a customer. Had he been nice, it may have turned out differently, but you never speak to a customer like their business in not important to the company.  But wait...it gets better.  He proceeds to sign my signature via docusign himself!!!  The choose a font version, not my actual signature like I had done on the original contract.  Once I realized what was going on I was floored, I told him that I was canceling my order and asked him for a document stating I was not bound to the contract I had actually signed. He said he couldn't give me that, so I said I wasn't leaving until he did.  So he proceeds to write it out on the back of a tiny business card. So very professional.  I'm very sorry that my little $4101 shed purchase is so disposable to Tuff Sheds that they could not honor the original signed contract.  Another company will be getting my business going forth.  And I will be telling everyone I know, and then some, what happened here and to never do business with this company.  If my review loses Tuff sheds just one customer...it will have been worth the effort of writing it.   Shame on you sales guy.

After being slightly disappointed by the Yelp event (we just could not physically get near the food), we decided to have dinner here. I thought this would be a possibility beforehand, so I called to make reservations. I would suggest anyone do this, if you know you will be coming and want something in particular on the menu. Because this is a ""mom and pop,"" they do not always have everything on the menu. Trust me, the 3 minutes out of your day is SO INCREDIBLY worth it, the ROI is out of this world! I asked for the lamb kilkal (my new favorite dish). 

When we arrived, the owner apologized and let me know that she could not get any lamb, I believe they were out of lamb at the place she gets it. But she offered to make us the beef tibs for free, and what she offered us in addition to that more than made up for it! She asked if we would like some HOMEMADE HONEY WINE! Yes, homemade honey wine, which is an Ethiopian specialty. I said an enthusiastic yes for my guest and I. Please keep in mind, we are not drinkers by any stretch of the imagination. This stuff was amazing, even better than the other honey wine I had before. It was slightly vicious, but so delicious. I know that they periodically try things at the restaurant that they make homemade. If you are ever offered any of it, just say YES! I can not imagine that you would ever be disappointed. I did mention AMAZING, right? Yes, all those caps are justified and I am restraining myself on top of that. Let me put it another way, my sister and I both would have gladly paid whatever amount they wanted to take a bottle home. Unfortunately it was homemade, and there was not enough to get a bottle each, but we got a full cup each to take home. This is coming from a person who has purchased a grand total of 3 bottles of alcohol in her life. And maybe drank 4 cups total more on top of that cumulative in her lifetime. (yes, yes, I am a lightweight) If you want to have some, they only had a little left (we did drink/take 4 cups), get out there NOW, or call and see if they can make it for you. 

I also took their last 3 sambusas to take home with us. Then came the kicker! I finally got to try their baklava (I stupidly, stupidly *smack forehead* turned it down once upon a time and have not ""hit"" upon a time when they have had it in stock since). WHAAAAA!!!! They must have this stuff in heaven it was SOOOOOOOOO good! The puff pastry was warm, flaky, butter goodness. There was the perfect amount of nuts (to me, not THAT much) with a lovely sweet honey mixture. But what truly knocked my socks into the next century was the sugar/honey ambrosia like mixture they drizzled on top. Do not be fooled, that little bit of clear unassuming liquid was some of the best couple milliliters of stuff I have eaten in a long, long time! Both my guest and I (thank goodness for great, non judgemental friends), licked the drops from the paper the baklava was sitting on. I thought I detected a hint of lavender or some other flowery flavoring in it. I was told that by the owner that her mom made it and she was not entirely sure everything that went into the recipe, but that it had the same spices as their tea. 

What?!?!?! How could I have missed the tea all this time? I thought it was just Lipton's, or some such. No, the free tea (I believe it is free with the meal, please check on this before assuming), is their homemade mixture! At least that is what I am assuming since several pods dropped out of the tea pot when I poured myself a cup to go. It is a delicious almost chai like tea, but not as harsh as regular chai. YUM! 

Well, those 3 golden nuggets were worth an update. Now I have to wipe the drool off my keyboard and plan when I can go back for more!",2009-12-09 21:38:02

Cons:  Poor Customer Serivce / Billing, Bullied 

I had previously reserved a mid-sized vehicle online thru Priceline for a 4-day rental period at $25 per day, for a prepaid total charge of $168.97.  I was then scheduled to return that car and pick-up another from Budget to drive from TPA to RSW, where I had reserved a convertible through Dollar.  Upon arrival at the Avis counter in TPA, the Avis Counter Agent offered me a convertible for my entire visit and to be dropped off at RSW for an additional $68.54, which included the prepaid amount previously paid to Priceline for Avis accepting my car rental bid.  For an additional $68.54, one car, one rental company, I accepted his offer.

When I received my AMEX statement, the amount that I had prepaid to Priceline had been added into the cost of the rental car.  $168.97 above/more than I had been quoted at the counter.  I contacted Avis of this over-charge via e-mail and received a quick response with an apology for their error.  She wrote that a new receipt would be processed and e-mailed within 24 hours.  I did receive the receipt within 24 hours, but the total had not been adjusted.  And no refund was showing from them.  I replied via e-mail for this to be corrected as soon as possible.  No response.  At the next billing cycle, there was no refund, so I initiated a charge dispute through AMEX.  Upon the information which I provided them with and the information they received from an Avis Representative, final agreement was awarded to me in the amount of $168.97.

About a month later, I started receiving monthly letters from Avis stating that there was an outstanding amount of $168.97 that I owed to them and that that amount would be forwarded to a collection agency if not received.  The first two times I called Avis to correct this, neither representative returned my call.  The third time, an Avis representative answered my call.  I gave him this information, to which he asked me to forward to him via e-mail.  He never responded or tried to make contact with me since then.  Nor have I received any more letters in the mail from them demanding payment or threats of sending that amount thru to collection.

Overall, my experience with Avis was positive.  My experience at the counter at TPA was fast, friendly and courteous.  The upgrade was more than worth it, as I was given one car at one rental company with drop-off at a different location for under $100 more than I had originally planned to pay.  The vehicle was clean and functioned normally.  Initially, I had assumed this to be a billing error.  However, after several attempts to correct it, I felt as though they had intentionally continued sending monthly demand for payment letters in hopes that they would eventually wear me down and I would just pay that duplicate amount so as to avoid collections, as it should have been resolved with the initial e-mail...not five months later.  I would certainly rent from Avis again in the future, as I have in the past.  Just a word to the wise....Do not let Avis, or any other rental car company, bully you into making any additional payments that were not previously agreed to in your initial contract.",2016-04-29 01:07:31
hKpX6gRx8fd2acLC4ct1kg,XPDd-LJze3_fqQ0weAO6sQ,wPABxiwpUVAvwMvQLDRkcA,1.0,5,0,0,"I had been living in an apartment for several years before the owner sold the property and the new owner hired Ft. Lowell to manage it. During my time trying to work with Ft. Lowell, I found them to be inconsistent with what they would say in a conversation and then put into practice; disorganized (one person saying and doing one thing while another person in the same office was saying and doing something else); inattentive (I sent 3 letters to the property manager, which she apparently never read; uncommunicative (they never return phone calls and they don't call back when they say they will); unresponsive (in letters to them asking for them to call me if they had any questions or problems with my position on a matter they never called but clearly took issue with my position); and ill-informed (in a disagreement with them I cited the law as I understood it and they repeatedly referred me to a lease agreement which did not exist -- I was a month-to-month tenant for years). I sent them a rent check which they said they didn't receive so I promptly dropped off a second check. They cashed both checks. When I received a reimbursement check, it bounced. The property itself has been in decline since Ft. Lowell took over and it was nearly impossible to get maintenance to show up and fix a problem. During a summer extreme heat wave a new HVAC unit was needed on the roof because it could no longer be fixed. Multiple phone calls were required by me to them and a staff member finally delivered a portable a/c unit so I could at least live in the bedroom for a weekend before maintenance could finally install the new unit. Come the winter and needing heat, it was discovered that when the HVAC system was installed they neglected to hook it up to the gas so I would have heat. The next day they returned and hooked up the gas, but neglected to turn the gas on. That was done on the 3rd visit and after many phone calls to a woman telling me she would look into the matter and call me right back (which never happened). Although I understand Ft. Lowell is in business to make money for themselves, they seemed determined to raise the rent to what they called ""market value"" while ignoring the condition of the apartment and property. In addition to paying more and more rent, I incurred extraordinarily high utility bills in extreme weather temperatures because energy leaked unbelievably through the windows and doors of the apartment. In March as the country was shutting down due to COVID, the owner of Ft. Lowell sent an email reminding tenants to pay their rent on time so he could pay the mortgage on time. As COVID cases were soaring and deaths were rising, I received a notice from the property manager that my rent was increasing by a substantial amount (after a phone conversation the year before during which she said she had no intention of raising the rent again by a substantial amount). Since I could not afford the rent increase, I was put in a position of having to run around and find a place to live while trying to protect myself from COVID, follow CDC guidelines and was dealing with the death of family members due to COVID. In each written communication I received from them they referred to me as ""a valued tenant"". If that's they way they treat valued tenants, then ....",2021-02-08 13:25:35

First, we arrived at 530 PM and the hostess laughed at me when I requested to be near the band.  She sat us off to the side of the stage saying all the tables were reserved even though there were many tables where one could actually see the band.  I walked back up front and pleaded my case again as not all the tables in front of the band had reserved placards the hostess says they were reserved and told me no to a move to another table. While we stayed over an hour and a half only half the tables were ever occupied.  Go figure...

Decide to just move and sit at the bar since it was only half occupied.  Waited 10 minutes, finally snagging the bartender, I ordered drinks. Another 10 minutes, drinks arrive.  After 30 minutes ordered a second round of drinks and appetizers. Finally get the drinks after 15 mins, which was okay I guess since the bartender was having fun socializing with people at the other end of the bar instead of doing her job.  During this wait we discussed with the sound man why the volume was so low from the band and he said to keep the noise down during dinner!  At BB Kings BLUES CLUB??  REALLY???  I guess it's beyond reality to go to a Blues Club expecting good loud entertainment and NOT a QUIET dinner.

Another 25 minutes goes by and I finally get a chance to ask about the appetizers once the bartender came within earshot. She says ""I F'$%^ed up..sorry ...never put the order in""  I would not recommend her language to an irate customer.  She dropped off two more drinks as I canceling the food order and stuffing cash in the glass to pay my bill. I wanted food not more alcohol.   Left at that moment and never going back.  Since I live in downtown Nashville that is a shame since I do enjoy the music but not at that level of cruddy service.

The bartender apologized at the end of my ordeal. She should ..it was her fault, she single handily ruined this venue's reputation with me and my friends.  It should not take over an hour and half to get people seated and fed on a Sunday night.

Leave it to Philly to give a hole-in-the-wall Southern BBQ joint the appropriate PA spin. The basic crimson walls are lined of framed photographs of Philadelphia architecture, classic sites, and local events. The menu is hand-written on butcher's paper and taped to the wall near the cash register toward the back, offering some unique options like a Brisket Cheesesteak with Cooper Sharp. The handful of unadorned wooden tables stuffed into the small space are decked out with 3 signature BBQ sauces (Sweet Heat, Vinegar Pepper, Mike's BBQ) and equally rickety chairs. 

My partner and I rolled through just before opening on a Sunday. By the time noon hit, a small, hungry mob had assembled before the door. We ravenously took our place in line and filed toward the back. After ordering, the cashier pointed us toward the cooler of Miller High Life (on the house), and then we grabbed an open table. Within 15 minutes, a server plopped down a heavy tray before us.

We opted for 1/2 lb Prime Brisket, 1/4 lb Pulled Pork, 1/2 lb Full Spare Ribs (which worked out to 4 bones), a Small Pickles, a Small Gouda Mac & Cheese, and a slice of Cornbread (as a note, the ""small"" sides were shockingly large). The brisket was juicy, tender, and flavorful -- I almost regret even dipping it in BBQ sauce. The ribs were similarly tender but lacked the same oomph in seasoning -- I still readily chowed down on them. Finally, the pork was the only underwhelming option of the bunch, so I used it to enjoy the house BBQ sauces (which, although sporting a slightly unpleasant water consistency, were pretty tasty). Moving to the sides, the gouda gave mac & cheese a surprisingly sophisticated taste, in relative contrast to the stereotypical hearty rendition. The pickles were tart and tasty, albeit one-dimensional after a few slices -- these would better be offered as a small portion on the house rather than a full side. Finally, the cornbread was a letdown, dry and with only a single-note of flavor.

For $40 between the two of us, it is a fair option for lunch. Mike's may well be the best BBQ in Philly --  but I wasn't blown away. Aside from the brisket, Mike's pales in comparison to the classic BBQ joints down south. Don't get me wrong -- I'll be back the next time I have a BBQ hankering, but I'll be sure to stick with the surefire hits.",2020-01-19 20:54:08

The boyfriend and I went to make an exchange of a gift we bought (size was too small). The sales guy on the lower level was super nice and helpful. It took no time to make the exchange. So, we went upstairs for lunch. 

I'm always hesitant to eat at a brewery because it's hard to find a spot that makes great beer/beverages AND food. This is one of those places that you should just go for the drinks. The food is sub par. 

We LOVE Urban Chestnut for their beer and ciders. In fact, I love their Schnickelfritz for it's slight fruity taste. Today, I had their cider while the BF enjoyed a glass of the Schnickelfritz. Yum. 

What wasn't so great? The food. 
To begin with, if you don't like/eat pork then this really isn't the place for you. Everything is somehow smothered in it. I frantically tried to find something that didn't have pork in it, but the way they placed their menu at the registers made it a.) hard to read and b.) difficult to figure out if the items for the day were written elsewhere. To give you a picture, their menu was spread across the top and sides of the wall surrounding a long table of 2 registers  (kitchen viewable in the back) with what seemed to be more menu items written on the long table and on the front of it. It was just everywhere and chaotic. 

What we ordered:
Mushroom Dumplings- Don't ever order this. Unseasoned with hardly any mushrooms, red onions or brussel sprouts. The bowl of unhappiness was nothing more than pieces of dumplings and few strands of veggies sauteed with a lot of olive oil. Forced myself to eat at least 2/3 since we had a busy day following lunch. So incredibly disappointed. 

Corndogs- These were much better than the dumplings. Although the fries that came with it were over cooked and underseasoned, the corndogs themselves were crispy on the outside with a nice juicy sausage in the middle. The casing of the sausage was crisp while the meat on the inside was firm and juicy. 

Service- Food service is slow. Took almost 15 to get our food and the place was hardly packed. Curious as to how their service is with a full house.

Will I go again? For the food, definitely not. But I'll definitely be back for the beer.",2014-12-31 05:07:40

In 2011 we leased a Mazda 3 for three years, Maturity date was Aug. 1, 2014. In January of this year, we were shopping around for my wife and went here since we had a good experience before. The salesman that we spoke too told me that Mazda was offering a Lease Pull Ahead (allowing us to get out of our lease early) for 6 months if we purchased a new car. I had to wait until February 1st to purchase the car to take advantage of this offer. Fast forward, February 3rd rolls around, they tell me the offer is still good, called Mazda Financial Services and confirmed the offer, and we purchased a new car.

However, when we went to turn in the car, called Mazda on the 4th, they said that no such deal ever existed, and I would have to deal with the dealership. The dealership told me they would look into it and talk with the Mazda District Manager and see if they could work something out, and, spoiler alert, they couldn't / wouldn't.

The following month, we get a phone call from, guess who? Ray Skillman! Offering a Lease Pull ahead if we come in and turn in our 2011 Mazda 3!

So not only do these guys lie to get sales, but they can't even keep track of who they've ripped off! We get calls every week asking us to turn in the car and get a new one and then after talking to them for a few minutes, they remember who we are, and offer to try and ""Work with us"" to solve the issue, and never return our calls after that.

So that's the end of that story, lets talk about the service department. I've taken every one of my Mazda's there for the past 8 years I've lived in the area, and every time we take them in, it comes back with something broken. One time it was the headlight, they tried to blame on us. This last time, someone must have been using the arm rest to write their notes on, and the pen broke through the paper, and wrote all over the leather, and they tried to say that wasn't them, even though you could make out what they wrote, and was clearly the guys name that worked on the car, and that what he did! So don't trust the people in the service department either. 

The best time, was when I went in there for some warranty work and they said they would cover a rental car since it was going to be a week for it to get fixed, and the warranty I had covered a rental car. When the repair was finished and I went to get reimbursed for the rental car, $350-ish dollars, they told me that it wasn't covered and offered me a $50 gift card for Mazda Accessories, for my ""inconvenience"".

Long review, yes, but the thing to take away from this, Go somewhere else. Drive the extra 10 - 15 miles and go to Greenwood to get your Mazda serviced, and to purchase. Don't trust these guys, they are nothing but crooks.",2014-06-12 21:19:46

We walk into the front doors to a loud and bright environment and get seated on top of a giant support beam in front of kitchen, I had a bad feeling as soon as I saw the table amongst the many other empty ones (find out later I was right).
My friends orders his food, shrimp fajitas and the other ordered a set of fish tacos.  I on the hand placed an order with Alisha for a La Bamba burrito.  The water tastes soooo good up to this point and the salsa is more vinegar based than anything else, but not the absolute worse I've ever had.  
Sitting there and roughly 10-15 minutes go by and boom, pop, sizzle out comes the shrimp fajita smoking and steaming hot.  Smells and looks like a great time.  Out like a train behind it, the fish taco plate  comes out getting ready to make her tastes buds flop.  I'm sitting there giddy as a school girl on her first date just waiting for that moment of pure bliss when my plate arrives.
Guess what.....I'm not Cinderella, there's no happily ever after.
My plate stood me up and let me down.  My friends finished there food to their best abilities.  So, since we never got a call back, I got up to find our server to grab them to go boxes and the check. 
I picked up the check when she dropped it off and it was for the party in the next section, then I told her to remove the La Bamba burrito because it never showed up and I didn't have time to wait for it to be cooked just to reheat it later.  She looked me confused  and shocked for a second muttered ""oh I'm sorry I forgot to put it in"". Then we got the proper check.

x5d8zTFb-5Ej__vvNyiMtQ,D8CF2H3DYtNJlzR0IITMHQ,eFeBGZ8xbYR-LiESfovs_g,3.0,1,0,2,"I read RNR and learned about a new cheese-steak contender in town, and had to try it right away, as cheese steak is one of my favorite foods. 

I had a feeling it was the old pizza place, last time I was there it was a guy serving NY pizza. The owner was doing everything, and it wasn't going very smooth, so I never went back. I talked with the new owner and it turns out that was a couple of years, crazy, I didn't realize it was that long ago. 

So, I got the cheese steak, and the one I like is cheese steak + add lettuce, tomato and mayo. This sandwich combo is awesome, it has a nice blend between hot and cold. It has the hot gooey, salty, cheese, and meat balance by a cool creamy mayo around it, cool lettuce and tomato to round it out. It's like a cheese steak burger. 

So I ordered the same thing here. I asked the owner, and he's not from Philadelphia but Phoenix, and he was unsure why people keep printing that. It makes sense as this cheese steak is Ok, but didn't wow me, nor did I get enough to eat. I am actually still hungry right now. 

As my readers know I have a Dragonic Appetite from time to time, and I like to be able to choose the right meal, which will fill me up properly, in this case there was no options to fill that appetite, just 1 price which was $8.95. I didn't ask, but I figure it was going to be 12 inch sandwich. 

$9 To me that's not cheap nor expensive for a cheese steak, it's actually priced just right, but the food was only about an 8 inch roll and it had meat and cheese, but it wasn't abundant. The balance of the sandwich was weighted toward the add-ons. It was about 40-60 (meat-cheese to lettuce, tomato, onion, plus). 

I have to be honest and say I wouldn't order that sandwich again for that price point and what I received. What I did like are the sides, and you get 1 side with the sandwich. I haven't seen sides coming with a cheese steak before, but in this case it makes sense, when you are getting a smaller cheese steak, otherwise I would be still starving right now, instead of just still hungry. 

I sampled the two sides, 1 was wasabi macaroni salad and the other was chipotle potato salad, They were both well down and interesting. The side you get is a decent size, but still does not make up for the lack of cheese and steak in sandwich inside a 8"" sandwich roll. 

Just to note I always order 12"" rolls, and most times the steak and cheese is 85%-90% of the sandwich with 10%-15% being the lettuce and tomato. That's that kind of balance I need and I can get that at a $9 price point and get an extra 4 inches of abundant meat and cheese, which I am very full after eating. 

They serve burgers and breakfast sandwiches, so I might try one of those in the future and see if I can find a winner.",2015-06-07 00:55:44

On Friday night my boyfriend and I were up in the Pinellas Park area and decided we wanted to grab some Italian, and I suggested Olive Garden. We got to the restaurant and were seated right away. Our server, Alexandria, came over and greeted us and awkwardly offered us a sample of their house wine. It was a white wine blend and I asked her what type of whites were in it, to which she responded she didn't know and began reading the back of the bottle and then said she didn't know. I said, sure, I'll try a sample, as I usually get moscato when we go places but I was willing to try the house white to maybe switch things up. She asked for my ID, to which I showed her and she looked at it for some time and then kept looking at me, and finally gave me my sample. My boyfriend, who prefers sweet drinks ordered a summery moscato drink and she also asked for his ID and took awhile looking at it ( I don't think she was liquor-license trained). I told her I would taste my boyfriends drink and then decide what drink I wanted to order, and we asked for water in the meantime. 

His drink came out and she brought our waters out, but forgot straws. She said she would be right back with them and to take our order. I asked if we could have some marinara sauce in the meantime to go with our breadsticks. When she came back with the straws and marinara we ordered our food and she never followed up with asking if I decided on a drink and basically ran away after we ordered our food. A busser brought out our salad and then a manager, Chris, stopped by to ask us if we were visiting from out of town. It was at that point I realized why our server was trying to run away from us, she had told her manager that she thought we were under 21, and instead of asking us for second, or third or fourth or fifth forms of ID she decided the best policy was to ignore us. 

We NEVER got drink refills on our water, she NEVER asked me if I wanted a drink, NEVER offered my boyfriend a chance to order another drink. We did not get offered salad refills and were sitting there with empty salad plates for awhile because she claimed the kitchen forgot to bring our food out (which came out late). 

It was the LONGEST dining experience of my life, it is a good thing we didn't have plans afterwards. I was seriously about to go up to the front to ask for more water and the entire time I was there I was sitting there thirsty. 

We didn't get the little chocolate mints at the end and the whole experience was a mess. Yes, I have an out of state ID card, I moved here for law school, and instead of running away and ignoring our table for the next hour, just ask for another form of ID, don't have your manager passively aggressively come over to our table. I will NEVER be going back to this Olive Garden and I hope all my YELP friends think twice about ever going here, I was a waitress for over a year and this dining experience was a slap in the face to the entire service industry.",2013-07-29 01:49:18
qfV5gg3ED1WEeTuoO55hHg,-0KosxqqMBYNfJ7VuvBYDQ,2UDJpaTsYHu9CXmbUMO8Sg,1.0,5,0,0,"My wife and I went to Fountain Side on Valentine's day, 2015. We chose this place because over a decade ago I proposed to my wife there. We thought it would be a romantic way to start off the evening. We got there and found out that it was a BYOB. I should mention that they were kind enough to offer each of us a complimentary glass of Cabernet Sauvignon or Miscoto. I didn't recall it being a BYOB before, so we left and picked up a bottle of our favorite wine. Whenever a couple came into the place, the woman was given a red rose. Our hostess never gave one to my wife. We started by ordering a fried alligator appetizer, which came out quickly and was terrific. My wife ordered the Broiled Boston Seafood Combination Platter and I ordered Capellini Neptune, but asked them to change the sauce to a Rose sauce. The salads were fresh and crisp. The creamy Italian dressing was wonderful. The main entries were served in an appropriate time-frame. There was no long waiting or rushing to finish the appetizer, so that is a positive. Now for the negatives! My wife's shrimp were so overcooked that they were exceptionally dry and chewy; so bad that she could not eat them. I tried one myself and it was like leather. Just terrible. Her scallops were under-cooked and smelled fishy. The salmon was cooked appropriate and was the best part of her meal. The Clams Casino came with hot peppers in it and the breading was soggy. Overall, her meal on a scale of 1 - 10 was a 2. My meal was not too much better. The shrimp were not murdered like they were in my wife's meal. They were actually cooked well. The scallops were another story. The half cooked, raw and fishy smelling and tasting scallops left me unable to finish them. The Rose sauce was OK, but desperately needed salt. The pasta was cooked to perfection, not under done or over done. Over all, I would give my meal a 3. Anytime you serve under-cooked seafood, you place your customer's health at risk. Since we couldn't finish our dinner, we decided to ask for the desert menu. We sat very close to the desert display, so we saw multiple desserts to chose from. Our server brought over a tray with several kinds of complimentary desserts that the restaurant selected for Valentine's Day. The small shared desert was ok, but we really wanted to select from what was available in the display, so we were a little disappointed. I should note that we were probably lucky that we didn't get something out of the desert display, as the display glass was filthy, with run and streaks from food dripping down. The display also had Hersey strawberry sauce and partially used icing tubes, which should not be in a display for your customers to see. The meal, in my opinion, was a disaster. I would not recommend this place without them making major changes to the chefs and major cleaning. I will say that our server was an excellent waiter. I never blame bad food on the wait staff. I gave him a 30% tip because the bad food and dirty display were not his fault.",2015-02-15 15:29:09
fjhNOBxqs5qxRYod3KUAjw,U2ALrjPfCcpNuiQ4MmnCUA,PgladPQF53C4syIB6ajoiA,1.0,5,0,1,"WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE??

Before i go into any detail, i have been working in this industry for 10 years so i am very understanding to certain situations in the restaurant business. 

My experience with the tea room began 2 weeks ago. I had called to make resvervations for mothers day. I spoke to someone who told me they are not doing reservations, but to call ahead the day of, and they would do their best to accomodate us. Well i called mothers day this year, about an hour and a half before we would be coming in. The man on the phone told me that since the reservation wasnt for another hour and a half, i needed to call back closer to our requested time. SO i called back at 10am requesting a table at 1030. I was then told this time by a different gentleman that they never do call ahead seating and whoever i spoke to the 2 times before was misinformed. We arrived at 1015, requested a table and put on 45 minute wait. Not that big of a deal, being that it was mothers day, but our experience just went downhill from there. 

When we were finally sat, it took about 15 minutes for someone to approach our table to take our drink order. Since we had sat for so long we were ready to put our food in as well.  I was going to order the lederach grilled cheese, but was told they are only serving breakfast so i had to choose one of the 7 items from the breakfast selection.  Not very happy about that.  The breakfast menu consisted of an omelet, breakfast sandwich, parfait, fruit cup, oatmeal, and one or 2 other items. 

Once our order was placed, our food did not come out for another 30 minutes. We had a visible view of the kitchen and could see all of our plates sitting in the window, but no one would deliver it. Once we recieved our meals we were pleased with the food. Aside from everything being a little cold from sitting in the window, it was delicious. 

Once we were finished we sat with our dirty plates in front of us for another 15 to 20 minutes. 

NOW HERES THE REAL KICKER. We wanted out of this place, ready to leave the experience behind, we just needed our tab. An older gentelman who was working behind the counter walked up to our table, clearly seeing that we were finished and still sitting, he asked us, IF WE WANTED TO TAKE A PICTURE OF THE TABLE OR WERE READY TO LEAVE. Are you serious? My boyfriend retorted with ""we have been waiting for the check for some time now"" he stormed away. It took another 10 minutes to recieve the check,  turns out they charged another table our meal so our existing tab had already been paid for. This is why the older gentelman wanted us to leave, he thought we already paid, and in a very rude manner was telling us to get up from the table so he could seat other guests.

The overall tab for 5 people for BREAKFAST was 75 dollars. I tipped the manager cash, being that he was the only one doing EVERYTHING in the restaurant and the one who took care of our table.

Overall this was a total nightmare, hands down one of the worst restaurant experiences ive ever had. The food was delicious, but unfortunately we wont be coming back. But hey, at least we can look back at this experience each mothers day, years from now and have some memories.",2016-05-09 17:38:09

The leasing staff that was here from 07'-11' was attentive, engaging and was always interested in making your time here pleasurable.  Now that the staff has changed and the Westover companies corporate offices seem to have more of a say in the daily operations things have gone down hill. 

Snow removal is a JOKE! They pay a service that just shoves the snow to the back of the parking spaces, all this does is force the cars to park farther out in the driving area, which means less street gets cleared. In years past they would hire a bobcat driver to remove large piles and clear spots as they became free.  It worked beautifully! This doesn't happen anymore because they care about money, and not your safety.  

Lighting in the parking lot is meager. The lights they have are hit and miss, sometimes they work.... Sometimes not so much. The lights were not working so well when my husbands truck was broken into, back glass shattered and his stereo system was stolen.  This happened the same night that they stole another tenants entire vehicle. 8 months prior a tenants tire and rim was taken off her car.  Gas siphoning is also a recent crime that a few of us have had to deal with. These are Just a few of the thefts I have been witness to in the last 3 yrs.  I was looked at with blank stares when I tried to address the safety issues with the leasing office.  I  then reached out to the regional manager of Lafayette about more lighting. I was completely ignored. I called for a week straight. Here is their number if you would like to get their take on the issue! 610-337-3994 

The apt itself is a good size living space. The thermostat is from 1976 so if you are trying to save on heating bills you are going to have a really tough time. The walls are pretty soundproof which make it nice not feeling like you are watching the neighbors tv. Laundry is available but only through a smart card system. This would be ok, but the only place to add money to your card is in the leasing office and they close at 6. If you work a late shift or have different hours it is a struggle to get money on the card. There have been reports about bedbugs and mice a lot more frequently lately but luckily we have yet to see either.  

They seem to spend money and make improvements on small things to make it look nice for new potential tenants without ever addressing the major issues that need to be dealt with for those of us living here. Everything in the recent reviews is totally true about power outage problems so I won't repeat what others have already clearly described. 

I really used to enjoy living in this community. It's a shame to see a nice complex turn into a money grab. All it would take to get this place to return to a worthwhile endeavor would be some caring and some listening. Sadly I think that won't be the case until more people spread the word like this and help other tenant to avoid a poor investment.",2014-07-29 00:25:32
UFsZF9gtUnHLoqpbTnqt2w,SDytcPY5fiuuDbTkPE8GyA,m1HVolBJiYajyq07J550jQ,4.0,7,6,7,"We went to New Orleans for my  50th  birthday!
 First of all I can  not believe  I am  50 years  old! Secondly we  were all over the map on  where to go for my  birthday. We had to leave our apartment anyway due to damage being fixed from on going leaks.
I was only recently  cleared  to travel but only within  3  hours of NYC.  My original choice was to go to The  French Laundry in Northern Cali. But I can  not travel that  far.
  Then we planned on Puerto Rico and book marked everywhere we were going to go on Yelp.  The flight is shorter to PR  but still too long for my  condition. I like  warm weather so it narrowed it down to Florida and NOLA and having been to every resort town  in  Florida we choose NOLA this time.
  So it was not my first  choice but a good choice. NOLA is rarely ever in the  top ten lists of vacation  destinations in  the  US.  However it is always in the top 5 destinations in  the US for food! Because of my  condition  I can't surf  anyway I might  injure myself  and I would be tempted too surf  in Florida so we choose NOLA. It  was also a diagnostic trip to see if I am  ready to travel and I am not for sure! But I am alive and celebrated my 50th birthday there!

So now that I got that  out of the  way here is my  assessment  of NOLA. First of all NOLA's CM Joi B is the community manager for Yelp NOLA but is from  Brooklyn. I totally get  why she  likes NOLA. She was helpful in helping me plan my birthday  trip! http://www.yelp.com/biz/city-of-new-orleans-new-orleans-2#hrid:pihzCksOX4VB4nK5x3CSNg
First of all much of NYC  has lost it's flava. Here is a blog  about that. http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2012/12/2012-vanishings.html
But this is a review about NOLA not NYC but it is just to show you a New Yorkers perspective  on  NOLA. NOLA has it's own vibe.  The residents are not trying to make it another city like transplants in Brooklyn  are. 
That is what I miss about how NYC was before our present  mayor but I digress.
We also met up with  Steve I an  Elite  resident  of Nola.  http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DAeC-Y66n-jNMJJw4oAfNQ
We chose our hotel based on  Steve I's recommendation!

Because of my condition I could not stay a long time.  So I wanted to avoid tourists traps. Here is a site  that helps you do just that. http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/North_America/United_States_of_America/Louisiana/New_Orleans-793014/Tourist_Traps-New_Orleans-TG-C-1.html
To begin with to avoid Margaritaville since there are  Margaritaville's in  every tourist town just about ,no need to go we went to a few of them.  Also to avoid Mothers restaurant.  Also to avoid the new Bubba Gump which is also in every major tourists area.
 People seem to  be divided about Cafe Dumond. There were lng lines at  all times of the day though  they are 24 hours.  Most of the residents we spoke to said to avoid it and go to Cafe Beignet.  So we did that! But for those interested the River Walk has a small cafe Beignet. Nobody seemed to know about it and there were no lines!

  I respect anyone or any thing or any place  that is true to itself. And NOLA is true to itself. It is charming and quaint and picturesque. The  residents are  really friendly. Steve  I offered to show us around! http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DAeC-Y66n-jNMJJw4oAfNQI know  a Park Avenue  (allergy doctor) who is originally from NOLA.  So many complain about the humidity and heat there but he says it is worse in NYC. (Scientist call NYC  heat island )http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2005/nyc_heatisland.html) So at  least for me  at  this time  of year  the  weather in NOLA is much nicer than  NYC.

.  Great   music, great food, beautiful architecture. Also, everyone is very chill there and the city is really easy going. That must  be why they call it The Big Easy!  Every house on St. Charles looks like the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. St. Louis cathedral looks like Cinderella's castle at Disney. The  city  itself is very whimsical.

The people are  charming,and unique.  All of the residents we  met  seemed to be incredibly knowledgeable about food and very  sophisticated. More so than  residents of Long  Island or Brooklyn transplants.
The  residents all explained the difference  between  a Cajun and a Creole. The  Cajuns are known to be more like ""Gator boys"" and the Creoles are  more sophisticated.
We were also told the history of a Muffuletta by locals.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muffuletta
It was invented by an Italian  not a Cajun or Creole native. The residents say the only place to get one is where it was invented at the Central Grocery.http://www.nolacuisine.com/2009/05/24/central-grocery/
When  traveling away  from home you can not have  a true experience unless you  try  the  food of the locals. Most of the locals never even heard of a Muffuletta.
 But when in Nola you must  try  Alligator ,Crawfish,  Gumbo, Jambalaya,  and local  Louisiana Strawberries. More when Yelp allows.",2013-03-15 20:43:10

As many have rightly pointed out, the empanadas are incredibly tasty. Crunchy, with just the right amount of filling. We had the beef, chicken, and beef with olives. Everyone liked the beef with olives best, but the chicken was a close second. My sister loved the patacones rellenos with beef, and my vegetarian daughter appreciated the mushroom option. I tried the mushroom version, because I honestly couldn't bring myself to take any from my sister (she was enjoying them *that* much). The mushroom option isn't too mushroom-y, if you know what I mean. It's really like a tasty salad on top of a super crispy plaintain base. Yummy. We also had the cheese potato with peanut sauce. The peanut sauce was not for everyone, but it was served on the side so you can decide how peanutty you want to be. I liked it. My husband loved the rice and lentils with pork shoulder. Super tender meat, and a gigantic portion that heated up even better for leftovers. On our second order, we also tried the avocado salad which my veg daughter declared her favorite salad ever. As per my usual strategy, I stole a little from everyone's plate so I can tell you it was indeed very tasty. It was especially good with the skirt steak I stole from my non-veg daughter. Such a flavorful cut, and somehow magically not tough like it always is when I make it. I rolled my eyes a little when she ordered a $33 item (c'mon kid), but it was worth every penny. The serving size is big enough for two to split, easy. And the tub of mashed potatoes she ordered for her side was cloud fluffy. I got the grilled corn to go along with all the food I was stealing from everyone else, and this was a great call (especially with the chimichurri mayo). Go ahead and order it on a date--not a single kernel stuck to my teeth! This time my husband ordered the choripan sandwich. I'm not a fan of sausage, so maybe he thought that would keep his plate safe from my pilfering. No such luck! And I liked it! But that was probably because it was actually not very sausage like. It was much more like a spiced-up thin pork chop? Except I'm sure that it actually was a sausage, it just didn't have that greasy texture I associate with sausage. Again, tasty. French fries were thick and not too salty. 

Summary favorites: empanadas, patacones rellenos, steak

We haven't yet had any of the desserts or mixed drinks, and we are really looking forward to enjoying the lovely space post-pandemic.",2020-12-27 01:45:13

We just came home from here after going for restaurant week; 4 courses for $35. Dinner starts with 2 crostinis courtesy of the chef. One is a Smashed Fava-Goat Cheese Crostini with preserved lemon, mint, extra virgin olive oil and the other is a Smoky Chickpea Crostini with roasted garlic, cumin, smoked pimenton. I personally liked the goat cheese one better, but they were both ok. Nothing ground breaking, but good enough. 

For an appetizer, my friend and I got the sheeps milk ricotta while our ladies got the meatball slider. The ricotta was served with some balsamic and olive oil and was pretty much tasteless. The ONLY flavor I was able to pick up was the balsamic. I wound up mixing everything together to try and coax some flavor out of the app, but I just wound up giving up halfway through. The meatball slider was good, not great and came with sweet potato chips.

Dinner is where Barbuzzo got on track. I had the grilled bronzino, the misses and my friend had the pan seared gnocchi, while his wife had the House Extruded Tufoli, which is a spicy pork pasta dish. Beside the fact that I was expecting a whole fish instead of a filet, the fish was fantastic! It was delicious and the skin was nice and crispy. It was served with an artichoke-mushroom farro that gave a nice vinegary note to the fish. I thought the entree portions were a little on the small side, but as far as taste, it was a homerun. The Tufoli was delicious as well and had a nice spicyness that perked it up. The gnocchi I found to be a little doughy but it wasn't bad. The Bronzino was definitely the star.

Then, came the heavy hitter; the Salted Caramel Budino. This dessert is everything its billed to be. AND, it was quite a bit bigger than I had anticipated. I was thinking a shot glass-esque portion, but there was a decent amount of Budino to be had. It is VERY rich, but its so tasty that you will most likely finish it anyway. 

They have a nice size wine list and the Sangria was tasty, if a little spicy. It reminded me of Christmas actually.

The meal, drinks and tip ran us about $60 per person, but remember that those are Restaurant Week prices. Eating here any other time would be quite a bit more.

I'd say the meal started out slow and picked up steam as it went on. Our server was excellent and even refolded my napkin when I went to the bathroom. Its a small place but it doesn't feel like it. There were some movement issues when it started to get a little packed but nothing too annoying. I'd recommend checking it out, if for no other reason than the Budino.",2012-01-24 01:50:50

Not only has St. Louis won a Stanley Cup recently (2019), but they're a perennial playoff team, have won 10 division titles, and through the last complete season (2019-20), they rank in the top 10 all-time in points percentage. Outside the Original Six, who joined the league from 1917 to 1926, the Blues have the most playoff appearances (44) of any active team.

Before winning the Cup in 2019, the Blues had gone exactly 50 seasons without an NHL championship. In the Finals that year, St. Louis went the distance with Boston. The Blues edged the Bruins, four games to three, and won Game 7, 4-1, on the road at TD Garden in Boston. In his first year in St. Louis, center Ryan O'Reilly won the Conn Smythe Trophy (playoffs MVP). ""The Factor"" came up clutch in Games 4 through 7 of the Finals, going on a four-game goal-scoring streak.

After the Blues fired third-year head coach Mike Yeo only a little over a month into the 2018-19 season, Craig Berube went on to become only the second interim coach to win the Stanley Cup. Less than two weeks after winning the championship, Berube signed a three-year contract to remain head coach of the Blues through the 2021-22 season.

Two of the greatest players in franchise history are right-winger Brett Hull, who played for the Blues from 1988 to 1998, and center Bernie Federko, who played for the Blues from 1976 to 1989. Federko was drafted seventh overall in the 1976 NHL Amateur Draft. He was the only player out of the 135 picked that year to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame (2002). ""The Golden Brett"" joined Federko in the Hall seven years later (2009). Hull and Federko currently hold the top two spots in points, goals, and assists in St. Louis regular season and playoff history. Their numbers - 16 and 24, respectively - were retired by the franchise along with five others.

The Blues have had only two home arenas: (1) St. Louis Arena, a.k.a. the Checkerdome, across from Forest Park, where the team played from 1967 to 1994, and (2) the Enterprise Center, located in Downtown West, where the team has played since the facility first opened as the Kiel Center in 1994. Due to the 1994-95 lockout, the Blues didn't actually start playing in the Kiel Center until January 1995.",2021-07-07 13:48:51

I've heard about Pêche forever. I've heard it's great. I've heard it's a must. I got funny looks when I told people I had never been. I even recommended it to folks visiting, just because I had heard how great it is, but I had never been there myself.

When I decided that I wanted my birthday to be a food extravaganza, Pêche was at the top of my list. I came here with my dad and, just in time, Pêche had just been named one of the top New Orleans restaurants of 2017. I made reservations more than a month out. I was prepared. I'm glad because when we got here at 7 on a Thursday it wasn't just packed, it was PACKED. Every table was full- wall to wall full.

Happily, we were seated immediately at a table right along the wall. Perfect! When I told the members of a food group that I'm a part of that I was going to Pêche they had many suggestions. Fried bread! Shrimp toast! Whole fish! I said ""yes"" to all of it. It's my birthday, I DO WHAT I WANT!

Fried bread: Uh, bread that's fried. Yes. Topped with salt makes it perfection. A nice crust on the outside and soft, tender bread on the inside made this appetizer a delight.

Shrimp toast: It was flaky and delicious. WOW. This was delectable and packed with flavor. I had pretty much starved myself for the whole day to experience this and it was worth it. All the way.

Whole fish: Everyone told me to get the whole fish when I go to Pêche, so I got the whole fish. I had two choices: one was big enough for two people to share and yes, I was very tempted to get this $50 fish all for myself, but instead I went with the trout that is made for one person to enjoy. The fish came just as God made it (head and tail attached) and battered and fried to perfection. This was a nice size fish, but I had no problem finishing it with the quickness. The meat was tender and it came right off of the bone easily. I've had a whole fish at other places and there are always those tiny bones to contend with, but at Pêche I was able to easily remove them. The waiter who cleared my plate commented, ""That's how you eat!"" and I felt pretty proud of myself for eating it all. It was also topped with some greens, but they honestly came second to the fish.

Drum: My dad got this dish and he loved it. In fact, not only did my father finish this dish (which never happens), but he raved about how good it was. For those of you who don't know my dad, that is a ringing endorsement. Trust me, people.

Because I wasn't done eating, for dessert I got the salted peanut pie, which came topped with ice cream. It was delicious and is a must for any peanut butter lover. It was all topped with a chocolate sauce drizzle and they made me feel special when they put a birthday candle on the plate.

I LOVED my experience at Pêche and I will absolutely return. Everything was perfect from start to finish and it's easy to see why Pêche is considered one of the top restaurants in New Orleans. It's restaurants like this that make me thankful for my fast metabolism.",2017-12-11 18:19:49

WOWWEE-Poozoweeeee! My friends, who have stayed there before a few months ago said its always like that. It occurred so often the first couple of days of my stay that I thought maybe it was a plant or flower that was giving off that pungent aroma but, a few more days into my stay and it left and then on day 5 it returned. 
I disappointment in the lack of cleanliness of my room. I stayed in room #12 upstairs and for $377 .   (Plus tax )a night they could invest in a carpet cleaner and shampoo those horrible traffic areas in our room. One morning, I leaned over the side of the bed to grab a tissue on the center night stand and I swear I got a waft of sweet barf coming from the bed frame or carpet. The second day of our stay, I was sitting on the toilet and noticed my husband had pulled the shower curtain to the opposite side it had been on. He exposed a partial gas pipe ( to what I have no idea ) and I huge ball of blondish hair- not mine or hubby's.  I left it there to see if the maid would vacuum  or mop it up during her service today. Not a chance! It was still there! I picked it up with a piece of tissue to make its disposal. Yuk!
After a few days of really looking at the building and the front court yard I noticed there wasn't any attention of detail and things where straight up janky.  The fountain in front had ugly asparagus fern around the base in a planter surrounding it. How much effort does it take to  plant some beautiful ( inexpensive) pansies or daisies bedding plants in it. What about floating some plastic flowers in the fountain? How about some candles on the court yard tables? A cheese platter, nuts and cheap wine from 5-7 pm in the evening to get patrons to mingle during their stay. Would have been nice but, I guess too much effort if your token it up all day long. May I suggest a Complimentary turn down service with a cookie or  a chocolate on your bed or a flower. A little air fresher spray of lavender to entice a peaceful sleep.  ( I think I missed my calling.) 
Last but not least, I must comment on the RUDE woman in the morning that works at the desk (I didn't get a chance to cross paths with her BUT, my husband and friends did. Why on earth would you go into the service business if you don't like people.? Apparently, she is annoyed and unhelpful and has no issue making it known.
A few other things that seemed to create the ambiance of neglected hotel was the broken down cast wrought iron  fence near the fountain, the burned out light bulb in the bathroom of room #12, the lack of a bench or stool in front of the makeup table in room #12. Also need to mention if you stay in room #12 be prepared and bring a sleeping mask to block out all the light at night that pours through the wall of windows. The curtain are not BLACK OUT. (of course, not those are too expensive.)
 I gave the hotel 3 stars for location. I don't think I would stay here again. It's just too tacky & dirty for the high price. I feel like we totally got played and ripped off. I would definitely say this place is a tourist trap.",2016-04-28 16:37:42

You must bring a Chinese friend who can read the Chinese menu though or you're stuck ordering Americanized Chinese food. This is because I found the English menu translation to be horrendous. I bought my American friend here and he was afraid to order half of the stuff on the menu because the English titles did not sound very appetizing. We kept on seeing this and that with ""special sauce"".  What the heck is this special sauce?? The traditional and well known sichuan cuisine names were lost in translation.

When I went there, the dishes I ordered were the spicy sliced beef and beef organs (known as fuqi feipian in Chinese, which literally means husband-wife sliced lung). I'm not sure what Yi Palace calls this dish on their English menu.  It might sound gross but If you like spicy foods, this is a classic Sichuan dish you must try. It's also as authentic as you can get here without having to go to China to get it. You can look fuqi feipian up on Wikipedia to get a better idea of what it is.

Other dishes I've tried are the zhajian mian or fried sauce noodles. This is a thick style noodle dish with hoisin sauce, black bean sauce, and ground meat. It's not strictly a Sichuan dish but it's very popular in China. it's also not spicy (maybe a tad bit) and sweet. I think this is on their menu as noodles in special sauce.

I also ordered the mapo tofu which is also an authentic Sichuan dish and stir fried pea shoots for my serving of veggies.  There is also gongbao jidin (or kungpao chicken if you will). This is actually a common Sichuan dish that has been americanized. If you want an authentic kungpao chicken, you might have to ask for it because the waitress might not know if you expect the Americanized version or the authentic version. The authentic kungpao chicken is More spicy and less sweet.

My friend also ordered salt and pepper steak. The waitress re grilled the steak on a portable grill right in front of us,  it was pretty tasty but it is definitely a more Americanized dish.

Whatever you order, please don't order sesame chicken, general tsao's or lo mien or anything battered and fried here. There are probably take out places that make these dishes way better and cheaper. If you have no idea what to order, please do google the dishes I've named above or Sichuan cuisine. The chef they have cooks Sichuan dishes the best because it's where he's from. You will not be disappointed.

Oh and I like how you can choose to have brown or white rice!",2011-11-16 09:50:53

It's also located next to the concert hall so I'm sure it drums up all sorts of business regardless if you're a guest of the hotel or not. Really great service and good food.

My friends and I were in Reno for the Rib Cook Off and, coincidentally, were staying at the Peppermill as well where Biscotti's is located. This particular day when we went to Biscotti's, we had also went to the Rib Cook Off earlier that day as well, yes, my friends and I are fat, we know this haha Anyways, it was getting towards 10-11:00pm or so and our appetites were needing some food....again...haha The place itself wasn't that busy, but maybe that was because a good majority of the patrons may have just left to get their seats in the ballroom for the concert that was getting ready to begin. Either way, we were promptly greeted and seated. Nothing too special about the service, but she was very nice and helpful. We were pretty tired at this point so there really isn't much to talk about so I'll just get straight to the point. I forgot what my friends had, but they had no complaints and cleaned their plates. I, on the other hand, while I didn't clean my plate, this is DEFINITELY something to write home about. I chose to go with the Monte Cristo Classic (See Picture) and for those who have never had a Monte Cristo sandwich before, you're are certainly missing out. There are tons of variations to this sandwich, but basically, it's usually turkey, ham, and cheese, whose bread is French Toast, and then the whole sandwich is deep fried. Sounds delicious, right?? haha man, I could go for one right now....anyways, Biscotti's take on the Monte Cristo is turkey, ham, and harvati cheese. The bread wasn't french toast, but trust me, that does NOT matter one bit haha. The sandwich itself is then deep fried in their special butter and then coated, or I guess I should say COVERED, in powdered sugar, so much so, that it no longer resembled a sandwich, but rather nuggets of powdered sugar. I've had a few Monte Cristo sandwiches before and this DEFINITELY takes the spot as THE best I've ever had. The turkey and ham was tender, the jam they used was very flavorful and gave that right tang to it, the cheese was milky and smooth, the crispness of the deep fried bread added just the right amount of contrast to the textures, and although it may look as if the sugar may have been overpowering seeing as how the whole sandwich was covered in it, it still made for a great balance to everything. REALLY  good and HIGHLY recommended from my point of view.

If you happen to be at the Peppermill and want to try out some different options, or if its late night and your hunger is kicking in, definitely give Biscotti's a shot, you won't be disappointed. Bon Appetite!",2012-12-26 22:38:49

I try to be an understanding person as much as I can. And I can understand the reasons behind this policy. But it is NOT practical. Taking out your own trash like water bottles, cans and bags, I understand. But there are signs everywhere saying ""Please clean up after your pets."" And the ""your trash, your problem"" does not exactly inspire people to clean up after their pets. So I took my two dogs to the trails for a hike, and picked up one of my dog's piles after he went. But when I headed back to my car (which was parked near a restroom building) I asked a worker where the nearest trash can was. And he explained the policy to me. So I dropped the baggie off by my car and continued with my walk. But later, I had to drive home with a bag of dog poop in my car, because I wanted to respect the park and its rules. 

But what average person would actually do something like that?!? The trash policy is ridiculous. People are going to produce waste, that's a fact of life! They might as well make it easier for people so they don't resort to littering. Many Americans are like kids: they need to be trained. Why not instill proper methods of disposal while you're in such a beautiful place? And I can't say for sure, since I don't work for the park, but they probably spend more time picking up the trash left in random places than they would going from trash can to trash can!! 

And I'd like them to answer this: So you want me to clean up after my pets? *Yes.* Ok, so now that I picked it up, what do I do with it? *Take it with you.* So you want me to drive home, with the windows closed and the AC on so my dogs won't die of heat (after walking/running in 80 degree weather plus humidity), with a bag of poop in the car, allowing the stench to be circulated by the air? . . . Really? . . . Or even if I did have the windows open, you want me to drive home with a bag of fresh dog poop in my car? . . . REALLY?!?!?

Wonderful park besides that. Love spending winters there sledding on the large hill; have done so since I was a little kid.",2016-09-22 22:09:27

I will start out and say the place was packed. Not totally ideal for covid precautions but seems to be the current trend. The outside tables were sitting on top of each other which was a little annoying if you needed to get up when seated outside. I'm not exaggerating, the chairs touched when guests were seated at tables on the patio. 

The food we had was pretty good but nothing was really mind blowing. We started with the pork buns and they were good they just came after an entree had arrived and the pork was barely warm. We had the torch hamachi roll which I really enjoyed. Probably my favorite dish of the night. I thought it was great portion and super delicious. The fish tasted fresh and the presentation was beautiful. We also had the chicken fried rice which is advertised as a ""spicier"" menu item but I didn't notice any of that spice. It was a really solid dish overall and the portion size was filling without being overwhelming. The ramen is where things went south. First being it took almost 40 minutes to show up. I had finished my fried rice by the time the ramen showed up without really any sort of explanation or apology for why it took so long. The thing is, we are spoiled with the stellar flavor of ichicoro ramen in Tampa, and this was good ramen but the broth in particular lacked in that incredible flavor profile I love so much. The broth itself was almost a little bland. However the other elements of the ramen were quite delicious. 

Our server was really nice and attentive. The only complaint about service is the food runners were always confused about which table to bring food to. I watched a sushi roll go to three different tables before making it to the right table. I know haiku is still newer so they're working out the kinks but the food timing was awful. Appetizer ordered 15 minutes before entrees arrived well after the entree and the ramen wait time fiasco was disappointing. 

The overall thought is this is a fun restaurant that attracts a younger crowd. The food was good enough and the drink menu expansive enough that everyone should leave the experience satisfied. The decor and design is second to none and satisfies that Instagram worthy aesthetic people are looking for. I would most recommend this place for drinks and small bites because I think that's where they thrived on our visit. A really fun Friday night atmosphere especially when the weather is nice enough to be outside.",2021-03-20 23:24:49

   ---   ---   ---

I love you Greg and Michelle!

They have done so much for my neighborhood, and I'm eternally grateful to them for that. But onto the delightfulness...

First off, the decor and look is definitely different from many of its peer, establishments. The framing of the building doesn't resemble a trendy restaurant, but rather something between a bread depot and a CVS. It's very interesting that the Baker's chose this space, but I really like how it stands out from the pack.

Secondly, they have arcade games, pool, and are open until 3am, 7 nights a week. I'm not the 3am type anymore, but I love that it's available if I wanted it.

Thirdly, the food. It's awesome. End of review.




And yes, I could just end there. I thought about just writing a one word review, ""YES!"" but I couldn't help but indulge on this one.

I went with the NY Strip, and the absolute perfect flavor made me forget about that $37 price tag (most expensive thing on the menu.) Seriously though, it was cooked and seasoned like Jesus did it himself.

For the sides, I ordered the cornbread and the sofkee. I didn't know what sofkee was, but the best way I can describe it, is that it was basically really buttery rice. I loved it. The cornbread was solid, but next time I will order the full appetizer portion cooked in a griddle. 

My girlfriend had the fried chicken, with the cathead biscuit and the tomato gravy & rice. The latter was basically the sofkee with tomato sauce on it, and I actually liked her biscuit even more than the cornbread. Meanwhile, the chicken had a very unique flavor to it, and I savored every bite.

The only item we didn't absolutely love was the peanut butter pie. We originally wanted to try to caramel pie, but the server let us know that it's oddly dry. We opted for the peanut butter, and we both felt that it was fairly average.

We visited tonight (day 4) so they were understandably out of a few items. I would have definitely ordered the smoked mullet spread if it had been in stock, but I'll put it on the list for next time :)

We sampled two excellent rosé wines, one from Sardinia and another from Provençe, the latter of which paired wonderfully with our assortment of Pulpo with mango slices (outstanding!), a mixed cheese and charcuterie plate, saganaki and other tidbits.  All in all, it's great place for a real tasting menu experience with wines well suited to the foods.  My hat's off to both the owner/sommelier and to the chef for the reach and breadth of the wine list and kitchen offerings. I'm especially impressed with the wine list because dealing with Pennsylvania's draconian and restrictive LCB could make putting together such a balanced selection almost a full time job.

Dining at Nektar could have been a solid 4 star experience and in fact, it should have been.  On a Wednesday summer evening Nectar was woefully understaffed for the number of fellow diners present.  It took us nearly 20 minutes to get our wine at the bar.  This was not because the bartender was slacking off; he was busier than the proverbial one-armed paper hanger.  Note to management-- have someone like the hostess, provide back up for the guy.  Not a big complaint mind you, true to other reviews the bartender was pleasant and even suggested that we order the less expensive choice of bottle of wine for party of four rather than four individual glasses of the same wine.  

Our waitress on the other hand as pretty much of a disaster.  She puts the ""WAIT"" in waitstaff!  It took almost another 20 minutes for her to take our order.  The experience reminded me of the Tom Waits song, the Piano has been Drinking (The piano has been drinking, and you can't find your waitress with a Geiger counter and she hates you and your friends and you just can't get served without her).  We also never two of the other dishes we ordered, so we simply cut our losses and called it a night.  Perhaps it was an off night or she was new but that only explains it, it doesn't excuse it.

Ok, so other than the waiting and the inattentive waitstaff (both of which are fixable -management are you listening?).  I'd go back and I'd recommend this place.  The food was great and the atmosphere and ambiance were super,",2016-08-04 12:48:37

It started off pleasant enough. Placed in a small table for two (no problem there) water started to drip onto the table and ourselves. A/C condensation on a hot humid night. We moved tables. So far so good. 
The server recommended a speciality drink ranging from $11 to $12. Traditional NO special drinks. Ordered a ""spicey"" Bloody Mary which turned out to be a glass of hot sauce and tobacco sauce with maybe a short shot of Vodka. Oh well! Like a 9.5 on the heat scale! Not at all enjoyable.
Onto to the food.
We had a Yelp free appetizer which we used and wound up paying for at the end of the meal (more on that later).
The French Onion  soup and two entrees.
We received the appetizer within a few short minutes.
Two medium crab cakes with a thicker cheese sauce. They were ok; lots of filler. At $13.00 seemed a tad overpriced. Just ok on the taste.
A bite into the appetizer the soup arrived delivered by another server. Within maybe 3 or 4 minutes.!!! OK? Fast service or turn tables? 
Not 4 or 5 minutes later still eating the appetizer and soup the entrees were delivered by the same eager beaver! I called the waitress over and told her this was a bit much and way too fast. She seemed annoyed or stunned or confused; couldn't quite catch the response from then on.
The soup was good! A solid B! Hot and tasty. 
We had two entrees. A blue crab tomato salad which was very good bordering on excellent with a nice dressing.
Then the disaster! It was (their words) a seafood pot pie!
Supposedly shrimp and crab in a cream sauce !
I was expecting fresh gulf shrimp and the same quality crab in the salad entree.
It was neither nor was it a pot pie in any reasonable senses of the word.
It had about a dozen farm raised small shrimp which were tasteless in a not so good tasting cream sauce. I couldn't taste any other seafood in the mix. Or at least discern what might be in there. It had NO CRUST AND WAS PLOPPED ON TOP OF A SOGGY BISCUIT! We left 85% of it! With the waitress already exciting a bit of a tude we asked to speak to a manager.
One came over and I told her of our experience. I offered to pay for the ""free"" appetizer and said I wasn't going to pay for the ""seafood pot pot!"" She just said OK and walked away. No sorry; no comment.
I try to be fair with my reviews both good and bad.
My warning is if you go here stay away from the seafood pot pie! It is not what most people would consider a pot pie.
Perhaps a change to seafood in a cream sauce over a soggy biscuit would more accurately describe it on a menu.
Bottom line is the manager took it off the bill and added the cost of the appetizer onto the bill that I offered to pay.
What was hopefully going to be a pleasant evening turned out to be anything but! Oh yea, stay away from the spicy Bloody Mary unless you like drinking straight tobacco sauce on ice with a canned string bean and 2 olives on the side in a toothpick.",2018-10-18 14:08:54
C6dnNiZ8o76RTIqJ1MpBGA,ELQDy8UYc5DF7EsUfiwhaw,aNthp0fq3I7FxGPXjZKanw,3.0,0,0,0,"A beautiful venue in a miserably planned out city. If driving in unfamiliar, crowded, poorly marked, poorly lined streets cause you fear or anxiety, then I suggest never coming to Philly especially if it's raining. I can't tell you the amount of times we missed a turn either from it not being marked properly, or the lanes not being marked at all to show which were turn lanes. I saw someone try to go the wrong way down a one way street and I honestly couldn't even blame them since the signage is such crap in Philly. Most of the time you have to guess and pray. Heck, when we were trying to leave, we almost missed a red light that was hidden behind a pole! We even briefly drove on the wrong side of the road because the road lines completely disappeared. This is one of the worst planned, poorly maintained cities I've ever been in. It's disappointing because there seems to be plenty of great spots and things to do in the city. Even this venue was absolutely beautiful! 

There is a lot right around the corner from the venue, which cost us $44 to park in. We were unable to get a spot in the official met parking area as they were sold out. 

We initially had trouble finding the entrance to the building. There are about 10+ sets of double doors and the only one marked entrance was the VIP entrance. There are no other signs (at least none that I saw) that point you towards where the actual entrance of the building is. You have to walk around the side of the building, past multiple more sets of double doors to find the single door they have propped open.

Seats are small. I'm a size 16 and that was probably about the size a female can be and still be comfortable. Any larger than that and you'll probably start to get squeezed. I was very disappointed by that. Leg room is almost nonexistent. 

We were originally seated in the orchestra which was good seating with a major lighting problem. The bright white stage lights kept blasting me right in the eyes (I suffer from migraines so that is a HUGE problem). There were multiple times that I had to block the light with my hand and even close my eyes and look away. On top of that, a guy that was sitting next to us was going WAAAAY too ham slapping his thighs (pretty sure he'll have bruises with how hard he was hitting himself), slamming his feet, and shaking the entire row. He even did that just as loudly and wildly during the quieter songs which drew looks from the stage crew. Frankly, it was driving me up a wall and I was becoming increasingly mad over paying for those tickets and not even being able to properly hear the band, not being able to be comfortable, and being at high risk for a migraine. 

I explained the situation to a worker expecting to be moved up a few rows where there were empty seats. To my surprise, they moved us the entire way to the front, side of the stage! I was legitimately blown away by the worker going above and beyond to help us enjoy the concert! That alone made up for everything else we went through!

However, I do want to mention that the guy sitting in the front seat of that section (arguably the best seat with literally nobody in front of him with perfect stage view while sitting), kept standing instead of sitting. I was left standing behind my boyfriend's seat in order to see the performers. If I had paid for those seats, I definitely would have said something about it. So beware of that being a potential issue if you get front, side seats (sorry I don't know the exact name for the section).",2019-10-21 22:18:02
noCwJKragVbR60FYZB3NUw,Qq64btjL3SDE2U1jCwoEfw,4R2KR_-FybS7oegGrXjHVg,1.0,4,0,0,"Despite considerable experience in the restaurant industry, I rarely review restaurants.  I usually don't review restaurants b/c the difference b/w great/good meals and service and poor/awful meals and service are typically a matter of due diligence, whether through Yelp reviews or the little things on the surface, like the decor, the menu, etc., that provide some indication of what can be expected.  Here, I write this review b/c there was no opportunity for me to figure out what an overpriced rip-off Del Frisco's would be.  

That's not to say that there isn't anything to appreciate about Del Frisco's: the dining room is simply stunning and the food wasn't bad.  My chief complaint is that Del Frisco is an incredibly bad value.  At the prices they set, you'd think that the service would be something better than an at Appleby's in the middle of nowhere.  But you'd be wrong.  

After I ordered my entree medium rare (from the blonde, female bartender who served me), I was asked if I knew what medium rare was--something said followed by ""hot red""?  

I had no idea what I was being asked of me, not only b/c no one has ever questioned whether I knew what I was doing when I ordered a meat temperature, but b/c ""hot red"" is an inaccurate description of medium rare, which is a WARM, not hot, red center (to the extent the center becomes ""hot"" it loses its ""red""-ness).  I don't mean to quibble w/the difference b/w hot and warm, but when I get dressed down like I don't have a clue about what constitutes ""medium rare,"" I expected at least for the person asking the question to know what they are talking about.  

A bit offended at the notion of an expensive steak house asking its guests if they knew what they were doing ordering a steak, I wondered if maybe it was just a server-specific practice (i.e., going ""rogue"").  However, when my meal arrived, I was INSTRUCTED by the food runner to cut my steak to ensure it was cooked to my liking.  I assured him that if it was cooked medium rare, as I requested, I'd be fine with it.  But that wasn't enough and he pressed on, doggedly.  

There's a lot I could say about this service ""issue,"" but let's just say it has been a very, very long time since someone has told me when I needed to start eating my meal.

To be sure, the steak was just as much medium as it was rare, but that's no BIG DEAL, I was starving (cross-country flight w/only 1 sandwich in b/w), and really just wanted the food runner to leave me in peace, so I said it was fine.  However, judging from how hot my plate was when it arrived (and the server's multiple warnings to avoid touching the ""very hot"" plate), I have no doubt that my entree had moved toward medium as it sat unattended under the heat lamp in the kitchen's window in the back, waiting for someone to bring it to me.  I suggested as much to my server, but he assured me it wasn't so.  I have handled thousands upon thousands of plates in many, many different restaurants over the years and I have zero doubt that I know the story behind my ""very hot"" plate at Del Frisco.  Again, normally I could care less about a very hot plate, but if you're going to make the temperature of piece of meat such a big issue, you should at least be more careful in how it's heated, which includes sitting under a heat lamp.  

There were a few other things that bothered me at Del Frisco: 1) before my steak arrived, my bartender  gave me a steak knife, but never gave me an entree fork, so I ate my steak with a salad fork; and 2) more than 15 minutes after I placed my order I had to ask for bread (my bartender/server  apparently prioritized making conversation w/a couple next to me and snapping pictures).   

At most restaurants, none of these issues by themselves or combined would be noteworthy.  But none of these things should be happening at the exorbinantly high prices Del Frisco charges.  

Among other places I worked, I spent a year before law school at The Prime Rib in Washington, D.C., which the Washington Post deemed ""the Dean of the DC steakhouses.""  There's another Prime Rib in Philadelphia and guess what: I just checked their menu and it  lists prices that are comparable to Del Frisco.  Hence, it makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever why anyone should go to Del Frisco.  Granted, The Prime Rib may still require men to wear a jacket and tie, but, even if they do, the Prime Rib always had a full rack of jackets and ties for patrons who didn't have any when they arrived and it was absolutely no big deal at all for us to provide them.  No one thought anything of it: the staff was more than happy to whatever possible to provide guests with anything that made their experience more enjoyable.  Which is what a restaurant should always strive to do.

Find Eric on social media. There is so much wonderful (free) content. ""E"" is direct, honest, and helps train our brains to understand what the dog needs. Second- Transparency! So much footage of the pack, their adventures, and the rescues they make for families like us along the way. I don't know of another trainer that has as much live footage. 

We rescued our dog Walter after the new year. He was isolated at the humane society, deemed unadoptable, I had to ask to see him. He was super high strung and hardly acknowledged us. Just kept circling the perimeter. They said he was sure he would mellow out once he got to decompress. His energy level never changed. We walked him a few times and learned he was leash reactive. Then food reactive when he turned on my 13lb Brussels Griffon. Water is about 80lbs. It was dangerous, scary, most would have taken him right back to the shelter. It was clear I bit off way more than I could chew.

It took weeks for Walter to even begin training with E. He had to spend a lot of time observing in isolation. E called or text to deliver the sad news and a progress report every few days. He assured us that he was happy to add on additional time and it would not disrupt the process. We waited- Walter came around in his own time. 

The pack was really supportive of Walter. E sent a number of videos in process of training but also a dissected version of everything Walter was experiencing. He teaches you to get out of your human brain and think like a dog. Once you grasp these principles it's so much easier to be a good leader. Water was super confused and following 8 years of neglect needed time, patience, and practice far beyond what we were capable of. E was the happy ending to a very sad story. 

Walter is a trusted member of our family now. He is no longer food reactive. We have had to adapt to his needs and keep close eyes as we build trust with one another. Every day we work and he has sure made some important changes. So have we on his behalf. He doesn't have to stay home because he's too anxious- he is an active part of our lives. E's program has changed our lives, and has certainly given Walter the chance he deserved.",2021-09-02 21:52:10

People take it upon themselves to just put something here that they know will add unique value to the town. At first, it doesn't seem like it may be popular, or profitable, or even if it will catch on. 

Sometimes, it does--like a wildfire. And St. Louis becomes a cooler place for it.

One such place is the CCSCSTL, an establishment designed for nothing other than the playing of chess and education thereof. 

It sits, unassumingly, in the CWE, just That Place Next to Brennan's With the TV Chess Games in their windows. But look inside! (Your first tour is free, anyway.)

You'll find an extremely well-appointed room in which to pull up a chair and play chess with any one of many enthusiasts, some more casual than others. The basement houses more playing area, a classroom, and a library--that's right, curl up in a chair with your cup of coffee and work on mastering your Sicilian Defense. Move up to the third floor and find more space to play games--this is where tournaments are usually held. 

Did I mention the tournaments? Because they hold many: blitzes, cash tournaments, kids' tournaments, round-robins, and then they bring out the big dogs: the U.S. Mens' Championship. The U.S. Women's Championship. The U.S. Junior Closed Championship. 

This is due in no small part to the fact that the CCSCSTL is beautiful--whoever designed this place did an amazing job. As a former member, it was always funny to watch a group take their first tour of the place: the men were geeking over the chess sets; the women, the decor. It's just cool. 

Classes for players at all levels are held; they offer a monthly calendar with a ton of events and learning opportunities. My favorite experience is taking a set outside and playing on one of their concrete tables. Having the passersby stop and get involved in the game you're playing is fun and makes you feel like part of the community.

That's definitely what this place is all about: the CCSCSTL has single-handedly, and very successfully, brought the world chess universe to the greater STL community. A few Grandmasters have moved to the area to be closer to the place. The block parties and events the the Center holds show no signs of letting up--they're here to stay.

That's an amazing thing, and a great service to the city. No matter your gender or skill level, you should stop in and take a look. Chess has something to offer everyone, and the CCSCSTL is a great place to explore that.",2010-07-16 23:34:29

I was completely impressed with the decor of the place when we walked in.... Giant water fall over metal mountains, rustic decor, candlelight set up for the dinner hour, and a packed bar area. I wish I could decorate this well in my own home, this place is wonderful! We were seated in the corner of the room, allowing the both of us to do plenty of what we call ""people watching"" I was thrilled to hear the gossip from the six women seated next to me... ""How dare he do that to you! You should make him sleep on the couch"" I ate it up! 

I was extremely interested in their homemade lemonade section of their lunch menu. I'm not really a soda or adult drink person, but I can definitely wrap my mind around some freshly squeezed lemonade. With all of the choices, it was hard to make a decision as to which one to try, but the peach just seemed to jump out at me this time. I was worried it would be too sweet of a drink, but after the first sip I found that this is a be a very tart, lemony, just-enough-sugar type of drink. They are SO smart in charging a reduced price for refills. If we were there for dinner I probably would have ordered a few rounds. I loved it! And I can't wait to try the raspberry lemonade next time around. 

I chose to order their French dip (although I was really torn between that and the mahi mahi tacos). The au jus has a taste that I haven't tasted before.... But it was delish with the generously beefy cheesesteak. I may be nuts but I like my sandwiches ""southern-style"" so I ordered a side of their homemade mayo and spread it onto the sandwich which just gave it a little more sparkle :) I would have taken pictures but they came out a little too dim. 

He chose the fish and chips which had a lovely panko breadcrumb outside and the fish was done perfectly inside. The kick to the dish is the tartar sauce. It seems like the added a little more than the typical tartar sauce, I could pick out relish, but I'm not so sure what else is in it (and it's probably a secret!). We ended up ordering a few more cups just to dip the ""chips"" in. 


Also, I love fries, but I don't typically mention them in my post... Sometimes fries are just fillers. However, I'm not sure what seasoning blend is on their fries But I just couldn't stop eating them. If you're a potato/fries/starch-lover COME HERE. But if you made it your New Years resolution to cut out fries STILL COME HERE and make sure no one orders fries at your table and give them the stink eye if they do. 

Price-wise, we are very impressed with the price in comparison to the decor and plating especially since they have a beautiful riverside venue. It's a casual place, but with a good twist on food that I'm sure everyone can enjoy. 

PS. There's currently construction on the bridge, which requires a round-about way to get there. We found plenty of free parallel parking for lunch on a Sunday within the same block. If it's a busy Friday or Saturday night you may have to relocate to the parking garages/other street parking-either way it's still a wonderful place that is worth walking a block or two (and you can work off those fries you just demolished!).",2016-01-11 19:36:15

My first time at Copper Country was about nine months ago, and it was completely by accident (as have proven to be some of the best finds in life- accidentally discovered). 

I was driving down Speedway in 105 degree July heat, trying to find Tucson Appliance. (Yes- this is a true story)! I was in the process of helping a bank seller of a home I was listing order some appliances. Turns out, Tucson Appliance moved- but I didn't know that, and I felt like I was driving around in circles. I think 98% of all Tucsonans would agree that the whole strip of Speedway from Alvernon to Craycroft all looks the same, making it easy to pass just about any store you are looking for on Speedway- without even knowing it! 

My accidental discovery of Copper Country arose out of sheer frustration, and the need for a diversion. At Speedway and Rosemont, I pulled off the Speedway drag and into the Copper Country Antique Mall. Mind you, I've lived in Tucson for 25 years... How many times have I driven by Copper Country without ever even wondering what's inside the colorful buffalo place next to Summit Hut? How many times have I been inside any of these other similarly ubiquitous Speedway stores? Close to zero... and the temptation was killing me. I had to know what was inside this buffalo touting ""antique mall."" 

It's true that one man's trash is another man's treasure, but here you can find both! Treasures and trash, trash and treasures-- depending on your own preferences. I spent close to an hour in this ""antique mall,"" that feels more like a flea market or giant estate sale. Some cool stuff though! A great deal of estate jewelry, which in my opinion (unless you are a jeweler)- it's hard to know the value of. Old telephones (very cool!), all sorts of random framed art (some originals- some originally awful). Kitschy collectibles, retro 1960's and 1970's lamps and home furnishings, clothes, old suitcases and much much more... It's fun to come here, but you have to either be in a dreamy mood for browsing, or be in a sharp mood with a good eye for buying. I was in the dreamy browsing mood, but I still left with an old English saucer that day. (Its new incarnation is as a soap dish).

Much of what they sell here isn't antique- so don't let the name fool you. My grandmother was in the antique business, and I grew up trolling for treasures with her. While they do have a lot of period pieces here, they also have quite a bit of modern stuff too, so there's a good variety. As for the sales people, I was as indifferent towards them as they can be towards their customers. You can either come here to buy- or view it like a museum and come here with an anthropological eye, and see it for the time capsule that it can be. Either way, it's all good...",2012-02-21 04:14:48

My girlfriend and I entered the place, and found it to have a decent enough atmosphere.  Nothing extraordinary though - just a nice looking place.  Our table was very wobbly, which we both found pretty off-putting.  Our waitress tried to fix it, but it didn't really work.  Our table was also pretty small.  Which wouldn't be a big deal, except...

So we ordered drinks.  They have a broad selection of both unique mixed drinks and whiskey.  I got the Irish sampler thing, which was three whiskeys.  They were OK, but not my favorite.  I can't really fault Gamlin for this though - they didn't make them, and I am admittedly picky with whiskey.  

The presentation was nifty - the whiskey guy brought them on a big wood plank, and introduced each drink.  Nice.

My girlfriend got a mixed drink, which was OK.

The drink menus were large and came in a nice wooden box, which they told us to just keep on the table.  That's fine - except I now also had a big wooden plank of drinks, and a large box.  Our table was small.  We had to move the box off to another table, as there simply wasn't room for both and our food.  Seems like a poor design choice.

Then we got our first appetizer - the three pigs one.  This was very good.  I do wish we'd gotten another slice of bread - the thing comes with a bunch of spreads, but minimal bread to use them on.  The spreads and meat were all good though.

Then came the entrees.  We both got the $35 steak, with the cajun blackened top.  It was basically fine - pretty gristly, competently cooked.  Nothing extraordinary.  I'm also not a huge steak fan, but my girlfriend is and she claimed it compared to a steak from a place like Longhorn.  Which, of course, is $20 less.  These come with a single side, we both got bourbon fries.  They were solid fries, not great.  The dipping sauce was interesting and different though - tomato-based, but spicy and thin.  Enjoyed that.  However, it's hard to be totally pleased even with that when earlier in the week we went to Five Guys, which has superior fries.

That was it.  Our total bill with tip was $140.  That's the biggest rub I guess.  We each got a drink, split an appetizer, sat in a place with decent atmosphere and service (our waitress was fine, by the way - no complaints).  But for what we paid, I expected a lot more.  The value was totally not there, and the food (appetizer excepted) was just decent.  It felt more like an $80 at best meal, with $60 thrown out the window.  

That's a bummer.",2013-11-17 19:15:43
MYFWQHHXd4sUWyg6v5IgEg,Sirbq3dll45Oo_Dn76XFpQ,KP5OncF2jhT7_J1phHPPww,4.0,1,0,1,"We came here on a Saturday night for the Tampa Bay Restaurant Week deal. It was pretty busy, but luckily we were able to snag a booth and seated almost immediately.(We only had a party of two). The interior is very decorated and the hostess was very friendly. Shortly after, our server came and greeted us. She was super friendly and it was very evident that she was knowledgeable of all the items on the menu. To top it off, she also came prepared with an Ipad and offered to show us pictures of items on the menu in case were wondering what the dishes looked like. The server started us off with a pretty decent sized bowl of complimentary chips and salsa. I do want to mention that I was a huge fan of the salsa. It was very flavorful and delicious. Tortilla chips were also on point. Moving on to our order... we opted for the restaurant week special which included one appetizer to share, two entrees that came with rice and beans), two sides  and a dessert. For our appetizer we went with the flautas de pollo. They were very good! Both salsas were excellent, but my favorite was the red one which I think was the salsa guajillo. We also had to get the tableside guacamole. (This was not a part of the resturaunt week deal.) it was a. I e experience but the guacamole was a little too salty for me. Next up were our entrees which we went with enchiladas mixtas and the iron skillet res. Both entrees came out and looked very yummy (even before we tried it). The skillet was still sizzling when it came to out table. The cheese was super gooey and delicious. We ordered the steak medium rare (per recommendation by the server) and my boyfriend loved it! The enchiladas were also really good. We ordered mild which wasn't too bad. I think next time I'll get a step up to medium because I felt like the dish was lacking a certain kick. We also got to each choose a side. We went with the elote corn and elote tamale. I loved both. You can't go wrong with the elote corn. It's got a really good off the grill type of taste and look. Lastly we ended the night with the tres leches cake. Heaven in your mouth, seriously. It's fluffy, flavorful and so so good!! All in all, I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the mood for some good Mexican food!",2017-06-30 02:23:04
4AG2JGs6F1SrVm-blxnTlQ,lAW03ccfMEuRZiDqvVgc0w,SZrM65lpxfjM45mK6STKKg,3.0,4,3,2,"I came to this location of Cabela's yesterday in search of a cheesy fishing t-shirt for my husband's birthday.  Should have been a simple task but alas it was not.

This location is smaller than the one located just off the Henday southside so the selection is probably a bit smaller.

I was one of a couple customers in the store and must have passed a DOZEN employees over a forty-five minute period of scouring the store looking for a freaking fish shirt in a size large and ONLY one employee offered me any help.  Even the two greeters when you first walk in did not say anything to me as they were engaged in a conversation of their own.

I literally looked in every nook and cranny of the store to find a size large fish shirt and while there were dozens of awesome shirts in S, M, XL, XXL, and bigger - there was not a single L to be had.  Now, perhaps there was one in backstock or maybe it's the most popular size but I wouldn't know since no one offered to help.

The one department that did offer me assistance was the shoe department and I did score an awesome pair of waterproof Kamik slip on boots (think Bogs or Mucks) but with a floral print to cheer up rainy days.

I settled on getting a giftcard for my husband to come back and pick out his own cheesy fishing shirt - and they did have a wide array of graphic options on the gift cards themselves including 2 fishing one so that still worked for the overall theme.

I also picked up a Cabela's fish keychain/bottle opener to go with the gift card but thought $6 for a piece a small piece of metal was kinda steep.  They did have intriguing BBQ lighters shaped like guns and fishing rods but didn't think it warranted a $15 pricetag.

Favourites for my family always include the camping section with goodies like cast-iron pans and pots and grills in every size and style you could imagine and I really do swear by their shoes.  I regularly buy the Muck boots ( toddler and and 6 year old fabout $80 and adult $140ish).  Waterproof, warm, and lightweight - best winter boots on the market for the value!  And as an added bonus, the insoles do come out easily to fit custom orthotics!

So overall, yesterday's visit was a disappointment in both stock and customer service, but I won't give up on you just yet Cabela's... But, I must say that your original Edmonton location has provided better service and stock thus far in my hunting expeditions.",2015-01-14 15:00:38
V16ZEy8w4n7U9Pbtj5tl5w,_Es93htE7FL4TyF0NemwzQ,OfjIf_YzD8dC7YlsV8a71Q,4.0,4,0,0,"When I first heard of Burgerim, it was from my coworker who lives in Murfreesboro.  Apparently that was the first one in the area and he mentioned he really liked it.  But I'm never in Murfreesboro and it wasn't until the other day when Google Maps made a recommendation to me.  Lo and behold it was Burgerim.  Confused, I tapped the recommendation and saw it was just minutes from my work.  So I told the guys at work that there was one nearby and we were off to visit Burgerim the next day.

Prior to going, I took a look at the website and realized this place serves slider-sized burgers rather than full-fledged burgers.  I'm not really a fan of sliders simply because I'd rather eat a big, juicy burger rather than your typical, small & dry individual ones.  Besides, the only sliders I consistently like are from White Castle (which are better than Krystal but that's another story).  So my take after reading the website was that these were ""gourmet"", customize-able sliders.  As a foodie, I was eager to try it (especially because it was new).

Upon arrival, I was greeting by the cashier (friendly staff BTW).  Despite having seen the menu online, I was having a little trouble ordering due to the sheer number of options.  The gist of it is this:
1. Pick your Bun
2. Pick your Patty Type
3. Pick your Toppings
4. Pick your Sauces
5. Pick your Sides

However the menu ALSO has five templates of burgers styles that you can also choose.  Since ""house"" choice selections are typically ideal in terms of flavor, I opted for the DUO combo, which includes 2 burgers, Burgerim Fries, and a drink.  My choices were the Classic (which is what you'd expect, lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, American cheese, etc) on a regular Beef patty with a Fried Egg (over medium) and the Caliente (includes spicy toppings such as Jalapenos, Pepper Jack, Cajun spices, habanero mayo, lettuce) on the Spanish Beef patty (beef seasoned with paprika, garlic, and chili peppers.  I ordered my burgers medium well and opted for the Burgerim fries w/ Cajun Seasoning that look like potato chips, but they are just like regular fries (crispy outside, soft inside).

The best burger was actually the Classic burger.  The patty was the right temperature (medium well), was very juicy, and piled high with toppings. 
 The fried egg was just perfect with the yolk bursting as I took my first bite.  This was a good burger.

My other burger, the Caliente w/ a Spanish Beef patty was pretty good. 
 Nice spicy flavors with the occasional ""crunch"" coming from the fresh jalapenos (just like good pulled pork sandwich with slaw) but my patty was a little dry (well done).  I'm not sure if it was due to being overcooked or perhaps the meat/fat ratio, but the flavor overall was good.  

I was probably most impressed with their Burgerim ""potato discs"" as I call them.  I expected them to be restaurant-style fries but they really weren't.  They were like a french fry in every way and honestly I prefer these to regular fries.  Probably because the ketchup saturation encompasses the maximum surface area of the ""potato disc"" whereas with stick fries, you can only get so much ketchup per bite (which is never enough).  The Cajun seasoning on the ""potato discs"" was similar to that of Five Guys, which I like better than your standard salt seasoning.

Aside from burgers, you can get appetizers of the chicken variety (wings or strips) and two choices of salads (house or Caesar) but who really comes to a restaurant specializing in burgers and doesn't even order one?  On that note, for those of you that hate burgers, have an allergy to beef, or cannot eat beef, of the 11 patties they offer, 6 of them are non-beef patties.  So do you have a friend who is a vegetarian, pescatarian, or just likes a good 'ole turkey burger better than beef burger?  Then know that Burgerim has options for your friend and will please them just as they please you.

Last but not least, I heard people balk about the price but it's actually not bad.  You have to remember the combos include a side and a fountain drink.  I know a lot of restaurants that serve ""full size"" burgers for between $8.99 to $10 that only include fries and no drink.  So it's on par with what you can get at other restaurants.",2018-07-27 22:45:25

The texture of the patty was much better and the flavor  was pretty good. Overall though, the sandwhich was dry and needed more flavor.  We ended up putting blue cheese on it since we had some, which helped. I looked at the menu because I thought it had to be missing something and realized they left off the garlic aioli. I did mention it to the owner and his response was blue chesse is awesome...lol..ok.
So I think I'll stick with the two items at dinner I like and the brunch, they do a great job with their brunch.

Ok so I've been to Thirsty First probably 10 times after my first visit. I haven't tried the veggie burger again but I've tried many other dishes usually during brunch time.  FIrst off, I love their brunch .Everything I've had is delicious. My favorite brunch dish is the JB Bene , the ham is delicious, the biscuit has great flavor but could be a little more fluffy but it's not a deal breaker . The flavor of the dish is seriously yummy. I've had a few other dishes and they were also flavorful. We came in today and had the tarragon deviled eggs and the bootleggers but. The Mob blt was heavenly, smoking bacon flavor with a slightly sweetened  bread, delicious sauce and of course an egg. A must try, their version is really good. As for the tarragon deviled eggs, we weren't a fan. The eggs were over cooked or old, they were rubbery.The mixture in the deviled was has a strong vinegar taste, it was so strong it came across spicy, kind of stung the tongue it was over powering. Not sure if that's how they usually are or it was an just an off day. 

As for lunch/dinner items, I've tried the pretzels, chicken sandwhich and wings at various times. The pretzels were ok, the wings were REALLY good, and the chicken sandwhich was tender and had great flavor. 

Overall the food is really good, I've enjoyed 85% of it and the items I've enjoyed were because the flavor combinations were really good and creative. The service is really good, no issues there. I think the prices are pretty good, except for their beers are probably $1 or so too much compared to other places dt. We love their enough to keep coming back. 

Also they have events, we were there for bingo to raise money for the Cupid Run, they had a contest for New Years eve that my friend won and they'll put a space a side for celebrations. So we'll  be to celebrate a birthday next weekend. If you haven't been, you definitely go in and have a bite to eat. Yum!",2017-01-23 02:26:24

Gracion Wunstell was the technician that arrived. I told him that the AC was blowing warm air. He walked to the outside unit. Without checking the unit and within a minute of arrival he told me that the problem was that my unit would not turn on. Lie # 1 because I had just turned it off prior to his arrival. When I told him the ac was working prior to his arrival he moved on to lie #2 without skipping a beat or telling me why without checking the unit he said it would not work. 

He opened a compartment and told me that the capacitor was bad. But the capacitor was not bulging.  Knowing that when most capacitors go bad they bulge, I told him the capacitor did not bulge. He conceded and moved on to lie number 3.

He then said the wire to the capacitor was burnt and that was causing the problem; therefore the wire needed to be replaced. When I looked at the wire and the capacitor I told him neither one appeared scorched. He looked again and said you right. I told him that the wire may have just been loose. He tightens the wire and the ac worked. 

Gracion Wunstell smirks and tells me that I was lucky it was not the capacitor or the burnt wire because it would have cost a lot. Well, I think he tried to sell me that bs but failed because I had some knowledge and I watched everything he was doing. Anyway, he ended up charging me $119 to tighten a wire that took 30 seconds minus the bs that he tried to shove down my throat as he attempted to take advantage of what he believed was my ignorance with ac units.

At the end of the day, I ended up getting charged $249 (tighten the wire + diagnostics charge) and he did not give me a report on the spot as they normally do or receipt, which made me suspicious as I whispered to myself...what is he trying to hide. 

As if Gracion Wunstell dishonesty was not enough when he tried to bs me, remember I was told the diagnostic included the outside and inside units, he charged me full price for the diagnostic and left without checking the inside unit. 

I began recalling the conversation we had. He received several phone calls. He complained about the time and number of calls he still had to service. He also complained that while he was working he was missing a crawfish boiled that was sponsored by a distributor. Maybe thats why he rushed out without rendering the services I paid for.

I called the next day and spoke with the service manager Neil. Remember the report I did not get, well Neil told me that Gracion Wunstell documented in that report that he completed a diagnostic on BOTH the outside and INSIDE units. Neil said he would talk to Gracion Wunstell about the discrepancy and call me back. 

Neil called me back and said that Gracion Wunstell ADMITTED HE LIED ON THE REPORT WHEN HE DOCUMENTED THAT HE HAD CONDUCTED A DIAGNOSTIC ON THE INSIDE UNIT.  

Neil DID NOT seem BOTHERED or APOLOGIZED for THE DISHONESTY committed by Gracion Wunstell. But without asking and out of the blue he said he was going to refund me $40. What a joke! I could not believe that he was serious! No mention that we going to make things right and come finish what we charged you for but did not do or we take such acts of dishonesty seriously and will reprmand our employee and take steps to ensure such behavior would not happen again.  Almost like he is $40 back, now go away. That was my interpretation. Anyway, as of the time of this review, a week or so later, they charged my credit card for services they did not render, but have not refunded the $40. I guess the lies and dishonesty starts at the top.

I choose Keefes because of the good ratings. After my experience, I think they have such good ratings because people are not versed in ac diagnostics so when they get their ac's working again, people are happy. Not knowing that they have been taken advantage by a bunch of good manners, bs talking robbers without the bad guy customs and guns.",2019-04-17 05:34:45
-hjHgBMqe6V7KnjXtQ85Yw,fWp72y6afnZC0Lc6MPcSow,2Auycj-cW9QUj36fuMrKaQ,1.0,13,3,0,"I had what I thought was going to be a good experience with a local business.   I was upgrading to an iPhone 6 and decided I'd keep my 5 since it was still in very good shape and working well with the exception that the lock button was a little glitchy.   More annoying than anything else but why not get it fixed?    So I go in and I'm initially told that it would take them about 30-40 min to fix and it would be $70.   So I think, sweet!  I'm in!!  

They go in the back and come back out to tell me that the part they have is for a 5s not a 5 but they can order the part from their Seminole store.   They say it will be in the next day.   Well since I didn't have the iPhone 6 yet I decided I'd go ahead and order the part (50% paid up front to iCell) and then once I get the 6 in the morning I'll drop off my 5 and they can work on it when the part gets there.    They tell me don't worry, they'll call me when the part comes in.

2 days later no call (should have been my first warning) so I drive by and ask what's going on, guy takes the phone from me and says they'll call when they are done.   Shockingly enough there was no call.  I had to leave the country on a pre-arranged trip so I assume that the phone will be ready when I get back.   

I never get a call from iCell at any point telling me that the device is ready.

While I am out of the country my well meaning father to whom I was telling the story to decided to drive in and see what was going on.    They went ahead and released the phone to him.   While this ended up being ok, sort of...  They released a device to someone who wasn't the owner of the device without contacting the owner of the device.   Not a good business practice.

At any rate when I get back into town I call iCell to find out what happened because I had no voicemails from them only to find out the device was already released.    I told me dad to go ahead and keep the phone and activate it since it was still better than his 4 and now SHOULD have been in perfect working order.   So he takes the phone to AT&T and then SIM card reader isn't working.    They try to troubleshoot it and never get it to recognize a SIM.    My father then drives, literally across the street, back to iCell and they look at it and tell him that they didn't touch that part of the phone so it's not their fault.

I get involved and go back into the store and speak with Mike.   I tell him what is going on and ask him to take a look at the phone and call me.    Mike does the unexpected and actually calls me!  The first call I ever received from iCell.   He basically tells me the same thing that they didn't touch that part of the phone.   He then goes on to accuse me of damaging the phone because of the time (while I was out of the country) that went by.

I told Mike that I'm not a cell repair expert but I was using my 5 right up until the time I dropped it off to them.   The original SIM was still in it because AT&T put a new SIM in my 6.  When I got the phone back it wasn't working.   I asked if they had a checklist showing that the device wasn't working when it came in or left their shop and the answer was ""No"".   That being the case they have no true idea if the phone was in fact damaged by perhaps a tech not being grounded while working on the phone or something.   They did not test it either way.

Mike was understanding of my point as well.   I asked him to please have the owner call me to discuss the matter.   That was 12/23.   I never got a call.   I went in yesterday 1/2 and picked up my device which was still sitting in a bag in the back of the shop.  

I like to support local business and I did so this time and got burned.  Poor processes, lack of follow through and poor customer service led to a bad experience.     I have an iPad mini with a cracked screen I was considering getting fixed and giving to one of my kids but I'll go with the name brand stores that stand behind their work.

I'm hoping that maybe I'll get a call from the owner at some point and he'll surprise me and this will have a happy ending....   But I'm not optimistic about it given my past dealings.",2015-01-03 19:52:19
nU6XYTPysEIA4UMlLiEt_w,lxc19DHoNRvazTbAECOv3w,dMBQyC4SbX0A2C8AG0yI8g,5.0,1,1,1,"Isle of Games is the best table-top game store in Tucson.  From board games, card games and role-playing games, to puzzles and toys for my daughter, this is where I go to buy all things game-related. And to buy those game-related things, I drive for 30 minutes, past 7 other game stores to get to Isle. It's just that much better!

What makes Isle the best (among admittedly other great gaming stores in Tucson) is the unrivaled customer service, top to bottom cleanliness without the normal gamer-funk that other stores are afflicted with, competitive prices with a 10% back reward program, and a family-friendly environment that is strictly (but politely) enforced.

When you enter the store, you'll be greeted by one of the two managers, Drew or Ben, or the store owner, Gordon (the owner has a very active presence in the store). The first thing you'll notice is that the store feels different from other gaming stores you might have previously visited. Most significantly, there will be no smell!  But just as important, the environment is welcoming to ALL people, unlike the intimidating ""ultra-gamer"" feel that other stores cater to in the area. And don't get me wrong... I'm probably in the category of being an ""ultra-gamer"" with over 425+ board games in my collection and two 7-foot tall bookshelves filled with RPG's... but I like to think of myself as a bit more of a refined ultra-gamer, and I despise the typical game stores that have that ""ultra-gamer"" arrogance and intimidation to them. Isle is not intimidating or awkward to shop in like those other stores; therefore, it's the best place in Tucson for new players to be welcomed to the community, or for a family to have their weekly game night.

For the ""ultra-gamers"" out there, like me, Isle has something for you, too. Drew is the best at obtaining hard-to-find, rare, and awesome promo items. And he hosts weekly events, tournaments, and demos for you to earn or win them for free! Now, like me, Isle has attracted other, more refined ""ultra-gamers"" and game-designers, so those tournaments wont be a walk in the park. Fortunately, Drew often has plenty of promos to go around, and I've never walked away empty-handed. And if you need a board game that is not in-stock (which is rare, because Isle has the best selection of all the other game stores in Tucson combined), Drew will get it to his store for you in about 2 days, at no extra charge. I've ordered some obscure things from Drew, from custom-sized card sleeves, wooden organizers to replace the board game inserts, custom component upgrades, limited edition game releases, rare dice... you name it, I've probably had Drew special order it, and every experience has been great. If you're looking to finance that new game by selling a few old ones, Isle has a program that will buy your used games for store credit, and will usually beat Bookman's offers.

If this sounds like the game store for you, come down and give it a try!",2015-06-19 16:20:00
ZnTbO-Prk16v8JRA6BfVUA,GJv1yf_IhUZqpDjFr86DmA,iJiNZw2TEwB579dr6LyVZQ,5.0,6,2,7,"In the 2-3 months following Hurricane Katrina, I was living uptown in the Riverbend because my pre-storm apartment had flooded, and found myself spending FAR more time than usual at Cooter Brown's.

This has always been a favorite spot, because of the cheese fries, because it's inside the uptown Tulane bubble, because it's a great place to watch Saints games, and because it's where my English major friends and I used to hang out during the last two years of college.  I have fond memories of looking for my friends by finding the cloud of smoke hovering above one of the booths in the back.  Another time a friend and I went around and tried to name all the caricatures of famous people that are hanging on the wall.  (Try that some day, by the way.  It's highly entertaining.)

In October of 2005, however, Cooter Brown's was pretty much the only place I knew of that was 1) open, 2) had beer, 3) had food and, most notably 4) had wi-fi.  Not only did I spend many an hour here working (i.e. sending drunk emails), but I also had some of the most profound conversations of my life standing in line waiting for food.  One particularly moving stories came from a woman who had been in the city working at a hospital during and after Katrina.  What she and her colleagues experienced is nothing short of horrific, and their actions were heroic.  This is no longer something that's terribly important to us nowadays, but Cooter Brown's was absolutely a lifeline for myself and many other people who moved back in the fall of 2005.  

That said, there are more objective reasons to check out Cooter Brown's than my personal emotional ties to the place, including the above mentioned cheese fries.  If you're a fan of grease, fries, and think an ocean of melted cheese plus a pitcher sounds like an excellent weeknight dinner, then this is the place for you.  They also have all kinds of seafood, and an oyster bar, though I haven't been since Oil Armageddon and am not sure about the status of these menu items nowadays.  

You can play pool here, get a pitcher (or six) and watch the Saints games, and you're likely to make friends with random strangers because of the way the tables are set up.  Long rows of tables make for communal-ish seating, and pitchers of beer make for new friends.  

It can be loud, it can be smoky, and it definitely serves greasy delicious hangover mitigating food.  This, of course, does not appeal to everybody, but I, for one, am a fan.",2010-07-30 00:02:37

But unfortunately, she now was sick too, so we were going to see Dr. Eberhart for her sports physical and a doctor visit too. We live in Edwardsville and traffic was not the best so what is normally about a 30 minute trip took me 40 minutes.....we arrived at 3:36PM.....I know this because there was a lady with her 9 or 10 year old son and a small infant in front of us and they signed in at 3:36 and we were right behind them waiting patiently to check us in. Her son even kept the door held open for us because we were literally right behind them. It took them until 3:40 to get checked in....when I was able to sign, I signed in at 3:36 because that was technically the time we arrived. The receptionist was less then professional and proceeded to tell me because it was 3:40 we would have to reschedule for another day! I told her we were there at 3:36 because we arrived literally right behind the lady with her son and infant and she said, ""I am sorry we are going to have to reschedule"". I said, ""That is unacceptable I am not going to reschedule because I am 6 minutes late for an appointment"".....I told her, ""I completely agree when a patient is 15 minutes or more late the doctor should be able to reserve the right to reschedule, but 6 minutes is ridiculous!"" I asked to speak to someone in charge and again the same thing, another female walked up and said, ""Oh have you been told you have to reschedule?"" I was livid, I asked to speak to the Doctor Eberhart, knowing there was no way she would approve her clients being treated this way. But of course the receptionist very unprofessional and rudely stated, ""You can't see her she is with patients"". I let both ladies know this is completely unacceptable and that I will personally be writing my experience on social media about the treatment we received today. They both didn't seem to care one bit! So after that we drove back to Edwardsville and had to go to Urgent Care and pay for what should have been a $25 Copay with Dr. Eberhart.....we had to pay $60 for my daughter's sports physical (this should have been free but because it was an Urgent Care they charge) and another $50 to be seen for her virus. So I drove an extra hour and half and spent an extra $85 dollars out of pocket.....all because we were ONLY 6 MINUTES late for an appointment! How many times have I had to wait over 30 minutes and even an hour to see a doctor and we are late 6 minutes.....UNREAL!  Needless to say we will be changing doctors!",2016-12-14 19:07:28

So, I was very surprised to hear about Sojourn Yoga, which is in that center next to the trolley tracks, by McGillicuddy's and The Wave. It's been there a little over a year, but I somehow never noticed it. I only recently decided to give yoga a try--I had attempted at least 6 years ago but never really got into it, thinking it was too easy and boring. I picked Sojourn mainly because it's literally 5 minutes from my house--and if you're from this area, you know how unique that is. I can't really think of any other fitness studio (barring dance studios) that are actually right in DH and not a 15-20 minute drive away.

Anyway, I took the Sunday morning Flow (aka vinyasa) class, taught by owner Liz. She was super friendly and welcoming and addressed all my concerns. They have a few mats to borrow if you don't have one, like me. A drop-in class is $15, the class cards are cheaper by the class, and there was no pressure to sign up for anything. There are even towels there if you want one. This particular class was heated but not to insane bikram temperatures. It was about 85 degrees which was enough to get some extra flexibility but not so much that my mat turned into a slip-n-slide. Also, the other students in the class were very friendly--it was a pretty non-competitive atmosphere. I left feeling like I got a great workout--it definitely changed my mind about yoga.

Admittedly, as my first real yoga class, I don't have much to compare this to, and I can't speak to those who have been yoga for a long time. However, I'd say if you're a beginner, this is a great place to go. I recognized a lot of the poses from dance and other barre classes I've taken, so I think it may be intimidating for someone who is totally new, but the atmosphere here was very relaxed and accepting. There are also non-heated classes and ones that hold the poses for longer, so those would be especially great for beginners.

So overall, I'm excited to go back. Parking is metered and quarters only, mon-sat, 9-5. Some of the bigger classes can have about 20 students, so the studio might get cramped sometimes, but my class had only about 7, with plenty of room to spare. The studio is really pretty and a lovely addition to the neighborhood so I hope it survives for a very long time. It's just what we need more of in DH.",2014-07-20 17:33:30

The reason for not getting 5 stars is the difficulty that lead up to this day. However, yesterday alone would be 5 stars had it been where I started.  

We had been there two times before. First visit was to find out more about the company as the reviews online were not encouraging at all, and the reviews I did find, after doing  little bit of research found that they were written by workers of Palm Harbor. When I asked why this was, I was not given an adequate answer and I left not having a lot of trust in the company and pursued a different direction. When COVID hit our original plan fell through and we found ourselves back at Palm Harbor to give a second chance, the sales agent that was assigned to us really rubbed us the wrong way. He was very knowledgeable but didn't seem to genuinely care about our concerns. Was a ""this is who we are take it or leave it,"" type attitude. 

A month later and a new direction needed in our search for a home and we decided to try to build a smaller home with less risk and money before investing into a larger forever home. We decided to give it one more chance. We knew people who worked there in years past and really spoke highly to the point of saying if they were ever going to get a new home it would be a Palm Harbor home, yet we, as of yet, couldn't see it. We called and called and couldn't get an answer (Seems like a common problem.) Then we got through on Facebook and was told we could come down. However, upon arriving we were told that the model we wanted to look at wasn't available but a sales rep may be able to take us through it even though it wasn't ready for public view. This is where everything changed for us. Nelson Williams met us in the lobby and didn't hesitate to take us to check out the home we were looking at. Sure we had to jump over a railing and climb up into the home, but that added to the adventure and I was cool with that part. I was grateful not to leave without getting a chance to see the model we wanted to see. He could have said no, it wasn't ready, it isn't setup fully, but he cared more about helping us see what we came for and didn't want us to leave empty handed.

Nelson was very knowledgeable and personable. This was a huge difference in my experience. We could ask him questions, share our ideas and dreams, and even push back on a couple of concerns and he patiently and joyfully responded to each one. You could see he truly cared and believed in this company. For once I didn't feel like I was trying to be sold but that he wanted to make sure we got exactly what we wanted. I began to see what our friends who used to work there saw. This experience was night and day different. To say that Nelson went above and beyond would be borderline offensive because Nelson went to the level above even that. From expertly sharing all of the features of the home and the company, helping us understand the process, and then spending additional time in his office to go over every detail. We probably spent a couple of hours going over everything but it didn't feel that way at all. Questions I had and questions I hadn't thought of were answered. A game plan was given and my wife and I left feeling like we have finally found what we were looking for. 

I don't write many reviews but I felt this one was worth writing about. If you are thinking of a Palm Harbor Home, ask for Nelson. We are excited about taking the next step in this journey.",2020-11-26 20:28:35

This was many different hotels in the past and it was a Radisson when I made my reservation back in 2015.  Didn't receive any notifications that this hotel had changed ownership. Like many I came to stay here during the 2016 Indy 500 races. 

The Lexington is located near the current airport and very close to the old (now defunct) part of the airport here in Indianapolis. So the million dollar question, would I stay here again? No. The staff were very nice and they tried for the most part. Sometimes they were misinformed about dining hours and generally just overwhelmed. The main phone number to hotel was out a few weeks before our stay and also during our stay. Can't figure out why it would take so long to get one number working. 

I think this hotel is close to the end of its useful life. The shower works just okay but the shower heads are a terrible immobile selection, the beds are sort of lumpy to me and the comforter was covered in miscellaneous stains, including some that looked like dried blood. The comforter looked/smelled clean otherwise, but unremovable stains were unnerving. 

The elevators are slow, and most of the lobby looks outdated. Our room air worked okay the first two days then basically stopped being cold at all for the last two days. Despite maintenance coming to look at it twice and claiming a wire needed to be reconnected, it never cooled down. The fan was blowing warm air. 

From our room the view out the window is of an unidentifiable fiberglass dome that looks like an alien spaceship. Not sure if it was an old pool or something, but it's a view killing eyesore. If you don't believe it, look on google maps to see the ""spaceship dome"" looking image in the middle of the hotel. 

On the last day when I was packing up I realized my perfume was missing from the bathroom counter. I brought only a backpack and minimal toiletries, so I know this item was taken from our room. I reported it the front desk and they acknowledged what I had reported with a head shake. Just FYI for those that plan to stay here in the future. I would have rated this possibly two stars, but after having my perfume taken I'm pretty disappointed. 

The complimentary shuttle was mostly consistent but slow. It did pick us up and take us to the airport after a half hour+ wait. The trip to the airport was very positive.",2016-05-30 15:00:00

TAP is removed from the downtown scene and truly that isn't a bad thing especially when you're looking for parking. Santa Parkina (credit goes to my chica Tina for that one) was smiling upon us as we nabbed the last spot in a small alleyway parking area.

Coming in from the back the staff thankfully had our table ready so we all moved to the front of the restaurant by the greeter table (self-service write your name down kind of setup). As soon as my bootay hit the chair I checked in using the Yelp app. Much to my surprise I got a coupon for a free Thai Iced Tea with the purchase of a meal and used it on the spot!

Our server was on it taking our drink orders, supplied us with fish crisps (lightly baked fishy flavored crisps that literally dissolve on your tongue) and making sure we had ample time to decide on our dishes. She was also very bubbly which at that very moment was refreshing since I was in a fantastic mood. She quickly delivered my first Thai Iced Tea which was in a large beer glass complete with ice and the sweet stuff. Embarrassingly I downed it with reckless abandon surprising even my sister who was carefully nursing hers. All I was thinking was the first one was FREE and for some reason treating it like those people who try to justify those calories don't count...denial is not just a river in Egypt ok?! After I came down from my tea high I was back to business scanning the menu.

The menu is minimal compared to my other Thai go-to in San Francisco but it helped me zero in on one of my staples, Chicken Pad Thai. In addition to that I had a hairbrained idea to get two appetizers for the table in the form of spring rolls (6 pieces) and Garlic & Pepper Wings (3 pieces). Everyone wanted the spring rolls but no one wanted the wings so BIL and I shared those. It wasn't long after that mini feast and the bottomless fish crisps that our mains started to arrive. People around the table dabbled in some of the curry dishes and fried rice while I embraced my pad thai.

The Pad Thai was cooked to perfection and right up there with the same dish in SF. The noodles were silky with a bit of al dente, the veggies crunched and the chicken was the right amount of toughness to make this dish practically perfect. I was able to finish mine while others had to take doggie bags. Nonetheless this was a fantastic experience that I must experience again!",2014-08-06 22:55:18

Justin C.'s review pretty much sums it up - mediocre food, mediocre service, one-and-done.  However, I'll say that the experience the beautiful wife and I had on this rainy Sunday, was worse than mediocre, both in terms of food and service.

I don't even feel like taking the time to detail all the problems we had.  Duff's already has my $34.50, do I really want to invest more in them?

Well, maybe I'll spend a little more time.

The experience started off great when some guy jumped out of his truck, ran down the street, and charged into Duff's ahead of us.  OK, I understand this place can get busy.  But as we all entered, lo and behold, it was about 65-70% empty.  As there was no need for him to stake out territory for his party, he kindly let us go ahead.

We were promptly seated.  Then it went downhill from there.

We had the ""fortune"" of having a server that is apparently best friends with the table next to us.  Which meant she wanted to spend approximately 5 seconds with us so she could go over and chat with them for 10 minutes at a time.

So while, everybody else got to hear the specials.  We got ""what do you want to drink?""  Others received water.  Not us!

It just kept on getting worse.  Upon a refill of my coffee, we asked for the check.  She almost seemed shocked (maybe it was the half-eaten food?), but she brought it fairly quickly.  Amazing.

So, it came to $34.50 (and it wasn't itemized, hate that).  I had in the wallet two $20s, one $5, and four $1s.  There's no way I'm giving this person a $5.50 tip.  Now it's all about spite and pettiness - and I'm getting change back.

What happened next was such as huge surprise.  She continued to chat up her friends at the table.  And kept talking.  And talking.  And talking.  I finally took out my phone and pretended to call a friend telling him that ""we're just waiting for the check then we'll right over.""

And she kept talking.  At this point, the temptation to leave $29 and leave was really high.  But I'm getting the feeling this would result in all sorts of drama that I lacked the stomach for (literally, after eating their food).  So we kept on waiting.

She returned from the kitchen with what appeared to be our change and coffee.  And she stopped by her friends and filled up their coffee.  And she went back into the kitchen.

At this point, I was ready to start stealing silverware as some sort of reparations.  But she finally came back with the change.  A tip was indeed left, though at this point, I should have given it to the busboy, who at least filled up my coffee promptly at one point.

The food was crappy too (I'm running on fumes here, pardon the lack of effort for original words).

I had the Creole Eggs Benedict.  This could have been better but:

1) It came out lukewarmish.  I'll blame the server for this.
2) If that's Canadian bacon, well, I'll be damned.  It's the most hammy Canadian bacon I've ever had.
3) The Choron sauce was OK at best.  But when you have ""Creole"" you expect it to be amped up some.

On a positive note, the eggs were actually cooked really well.

The accompanying fruit was OK, except that the cut up apple was brown.  And the sauce covered some of the other offerings.

I'm not doing back and I've spent too much time on this as it is.  I'm done.",2010-03-21 17:42:26
fe-yp1-cpfsbL6BUuimP9Q,dbWn8HCsG3eI9AmS2G3O2g,--_9CAxgfXZmoFdNIRrhHA,3.0,1,0,1,"Once I heard that USPS was going to get rid of this location. I lived right around the corner, and this was very disappointing to me. I came here often. Sometimes to get stamps, sometimes just to have them weigh my parcel so I did not accidentally put to much postage on it. All things considered, I was happy this place was so close, but always a bit annoyed when I had to come here.

In the age of Fedex and UPS, lots of people criticize USPS. Here is something that I love about them: the one-rate boxes. They have boxes that you can cram as much stuff as possible into and it is always the same rate.

Here is the problem with USPS. Fedex and UPS are much more conveniently located and spread throughout cities. I was lucky to have USPS so close, but not that lucky. Because this is the main branch, it would ALWAYS be packed. Most recently I was here bright and early at 8am. There was only one employee working and I had about 4 people in front of me. I am thankful the employee was cheerful and SO FAST. She really did a good job. I only waited about 10 minutes. By the time I left, the line behind me was twice as long. It will probably get worse as the day goes on, but more employees will join her at the counter. 

I recall that since I was a little kid, I have never been to a Post Office that did not have a huge line. That is why I used to despise going there when I was little. I still feel that same angst as I walk through to automatic doors. 

Michael S. is right to point out that they sure do have a TON of P.O. Boxes. And I never recall being uncomfortably warm while waiting in the huge lines, so he must also be right about the air conditioning. 

Overall, I like the employees at this Post Office. They are friendly and really kick butt doing their job while keeping customers happy. I also truly hope they decided (or decide) not to close down this branch. While I do not live as close as I used to, I can only imagine that the crowds at other Post Offices will only get 100 times worse if this branch is closed. Sometime less is more, but I guarantee that saying will not hold true for the number of Post Offices that the government has in any given region. While I cannot say that I am a fan, this Post Office was A-OK!",2013-01-07 23:41:14
cd0F_ts1sfDTwAXfat34xA,i2C5NI9DVBCbn1hCeDjbZQ,8xz4jzsKSU10CFvbHhYJXw,1.0,8,1,0,"Eating here was the worst seafood experience of my life!

I ordered the KJ Steampot with snow crab, seared scallops and mussels, and I also added a lobster on the side for a total of over $50. Hey, this is Indiana, so if I want to eat a platter of amazing seafood, I'm prepared to pay a high price. 

When the steam pot came out it looked beautiful. The crab, mussels and tiny scallops were wrapped in a green net over a whole cob of corn and potatoes. The lobster came out separately with several ramekins of butter. I was so excited... Then I smelled it and the putrid stench of something that reminded me of formaldehyde overtook me. See, I've worked in biology labs where we use formaldehyde to keep dead animals from decaying so we can dissect them, and one of the worst parts of the job is smelling the harmful chemical (which can cause coma and death among other implications if ingested). Why did my food smell like formaldehyde?

Feeling a burning sensation in my stomach after eating my crab, scallops and half my lobster, I looked up why my food could possibly smell and taste like formaldehyde, and it turns out after crustaceans die (e.g. crab and lobster) some of the chemicals in their body begin to turn into formaldehyde! This occurs over time even if the crustaceans are frozen but isn't noticeable unless the food has been dead for quite some time. I tried eating the corn and potatoes but after being nauseated by the seafood they tasted just as stingily putrid because of the steaming process. I asked the waitress Jessica if they were fresh or frozen and she confirmed they were frozen. I asked how long they were frozen and informed her I was seriously feeling nauseous but she just told me I was probably over thinking it. With my science background -- of course I was! And for the good of future customers. I never got a clear answer on how long their seafood is frozen before it was thawed and served, but I am concerned it was far too long to meet health and safety regulations. If crabs and lobsters are kept frozen too long, they become a health hazard and can make you sick which was my experience. This location was awesome when it first opened but is now on its last crabby legs and keeps its stockpile of relatively 'fresh' seafood in the freezer far too long because of its lack of business to be healthy or appetizing. For your own health, please avoid eating here!",2015-06-17 05:55:49

The restaurant redesign features exposed brick, light colored wood, more comfy booths, and tons of cacti hanging all over the place.  The rooftop bar area got a much needed upgrade with better comfy padded seating, and a larger ceiling added to the center bar to provide additional shade from the sun on the rooftop bar. 

Happy Hour is 5-7PM Monday through Friday and 3-6PM on Weekends and includes $4 select tapas, $3 Corona drafts, $7 Frose, $7 Frozen Mole Margaritas, and half off spirits, domestic drafts, and wine by the glass. 

Happy hour tapas rated: 
- Eggs Diablo includes just 3 deviled eggs topped with 1 tiny baby shrimp each  1/10  
- Chicharonnes are just greasy pork rinds 1/10
- Bacon wrapped dates includes just 4 tiny dates 2/10 
- Stuffed peppers includes just 2 tiny peppers 2/10 
- Pappas Bravas include a large tasty portion of rosemary salted potatoes with garlic and brava aioli 9/10

Other tapas rated: 
- Shrimp Escabeche includes just 3 shrimp for $12 4/10
- Jamon & Queso Croquettes includes just 3 tiny pieces for $8  6/10 
- Lamb & Pork meatballs includes just 5 meatballs for $13 and the meatballs came out a bit dry and have a strange after-taste 4/10

Even the Entree, Gambas de Ajillo provides a portion size that is 1/4th the portion size of most appetizers includes just 3 sautéed shrimp for $15 with bread. 4/10 

I can't recommend coming to Mole y Abuela if you are even remotely hungry at all. Ordering any food outside of happy hour will cost you a bundle as portion sizes of the tapas and entrees are so laughably small, you'll more than likely leave hungry. However, I'd recommend coming to Mole Y Abuela as a good spot with a chill vibe for drinks during happy hour. If you do order any food, I most highly recommend the pappas bravas! I also recommend checking out the rooftop area which offers some nice views of Downtown Tampa. For a rooftop with a better selection of custom craft cocktails I recommend the M Bird Tapas Bar at Armature works. Although portion sizes of their tapas are small there as well, they're still much larger than here. For generous portion sizes of seafood, sushi, and Italian with a great view of downtown, I recommend Jackson Bistro.",2019-04-15 19:31:15
ad2oAqMiJT85rfZzNr9puA,raS67uhiua2uejkE0zw3Vw,cLIk9VZW_c2Ng4b-6L9aKQ,1.0,2,0,0,"We hired them to lay new floor in the entry, hall and pantry to match my kitchen.They said my kitchen was a very odd  'mixed wood' floor and ordered both white and red oak to match it. As they were laying it, they weren't laying it in a patchwork pattern. Huge areas of just one color wood, and then next to it huge areas of a different color wood. As they were laying it, I asked them to replace several boards and try to get the pattern like it was on the kitchen floor. The relatively new guy was nice enough, but the 20 yr vetran was miffed. Day 3 I had to ask the vet to redo the feathering-in job into the old floor as it was a stair step in just one inch lengths, different from the length boards on the original floor and SO obvious. I hated the way the entire floor looked and was very frustrated but kept my containment. On the next day, they sanded the entire floor, including the new laid floor and the original finish off the old kitchen floor. That night I realized these were two different wood floors. My original floor was not mixed, it was white oak only. I called their lead and told him I thought there was no red oak in my original floor. He was nice enough about it, and felt that the floor (pics)  indeed looked bad, but not sure it was different wood and that it might look better and match after it was stained. So they spent another entire day, and stained it. Well, it still looked really bad, In fact worse. So the lead  apologized, ordered new wood, and I was out another week waiting. Even after the second wood got delivered in 2 days I still waited several days while they were doing someone else's floor. I was sitting in my bedroom with no front house/kitchen use for over 3.5 weeks during this entire job. I had also hired these guys because they had told me they had innovative dustless sanding. Because of this they never tarped.  All this work and them having to try to fix the first screw up left a huge, huge amount of wood shavings and dust all over everything. Now that they had to rip up this entire floor, I asked the lead (via phone) to have them bring tarps the next day for the 2nd floor ripping. They did, but didn't bring tape. The floor rip was started without the tarps up! At lunch they got tape. because there was so much wood dust on walls it wouldn't stick, huge gaps hung down, Their tools were laying on my carpet.  Again, while laying the new floor, the vetran was laying huge areas of same color values, I had many areas I didn't like but there was one area that was really bad, and out of all of the areas I didn't like I picked the worst one and asked them to replace two boards to try to bring in the lighter color and break up the huge color blob. He told me he wasn't going to do it and called the lead. After much debate,  the lead asked to talk to me and said, 'we will replace these two boards but thats it, nothing else.'  ( I was later told by the new worker the veteran was color blind.) They rushed on the last part of the job, instead of coming the next day to stain the next layer after dry,  they rushed it out, starting the stain at like 3pm and going into the eve. All the supposed layers at one time.And that was that.  After the job was done I see 4 areas where the natural stain color didn't ""stick."" Also huge 'holidays' where swatches in the middle of the kitchen floor of stain that was laid deeper, hence darker. The guys came back, and I was told they could do nothing about holidays. While doing the no-stick stain repair, they brought and used a different brand AND finish of stain. GOOD LORD h.e.l.p m.e. The next day, after curing, I called, and the lead said the guys claimed 'it was good and matched perfect when they left.' I asked them to send out another person to fix it (and told them what stain color to bring to make the match work.) The second guy did a better job, and brought the right color stain, but it still really didn't lay down and stick right. So now the patching where it was sanded out is bigger, looks worse than before they tried to fix it.(whitish) I should have taken a sharpie and tried to feather over some light brown to hide the spots when they were small. Now I can't. The holidays in the middle of the floor that I was told would get lighter over time, actually got DARKER over time. and boards now creak and shift all over the kitchen (which was 10 years rock solid with oil stain before) and in front of bedroom doors. It has been a year laid so far. They also left the edge tape 'stained' onto the carpet edge I had to use an exacto to remove some carpet to get it off. Water base stain is paper thin and doesn't last,an absolute farce. Its touted everywhere as better. Its because it is not as toxic to lay for the worker as oil based. The WOOD with the water stain is now so ""SOFT""and everything scratches it deeply, like dogs feet.....where the dog walked on the other finish for 8 years with no feet nail gouges. I would avoid water based if possible.",2018-12-17 10:38:02

I was treated like a king. However when it comes to their high pressure sales tactics and fast paced urgency to get you to sign seems a bit unethical to me. I explained to the office manager that I was on a fixed income Social Security I just had an added add'l expense of my prearranged funeral of 174 63 a month and that I cannot afford $25,000 to fix my teeth. I was very open honest and to the point. She could have cared less. The high pressure sales tactics continued. I was told that financing was available since they did not take my Covington Series dental discounted program as I do not have dental insurance.  I was told about another company that with my credit rating of 850 and I have great credit that I would get a great interest rate. However the office manager came back with the care credit credit and the procedure is going to be 6893.00 for the dental work and the laser periodontal treatment. I signed on the dotted line since Great Expressions would charge me about $5500 for all four quadrants for deep cleaning. When I got home, however I looked at the information they gave me a nice pretty professional envelope and on it was a total amount of $12,000 approved to this apparently care credit which is a Synchrony Bank credit card with 26.99% interest. My credit score is 850 and I am very very proud of that. So upon looking at the paperwork my estimator treatment investment is $17,835 which is supposed to be $6893.00 worth of work. I have a credit card from Citibank with 9400.00 limit with an interest rate for far less. Needless to say, I called and canceled my appt for Monday. I also was giving a Happiness Booklet that told me to support the government and do not steal. Well, usually the ones that have to tell you that are the ones doing the stealing. It was not made clear to me, I was not given an interest rate, I was not giving a bank for credit card, they only told me it was Care credit, which I thought was thru the dental office. I don't have a number to call them or to the bank that is with. Talk about misinformation to get that fast pace pressured sale sign on the dotted line tactic. I will go to Great Expressions have my four quadrants done.Pay my bill to my CitiBank credit card and get just as good of care and they except my Covington Care series 500 dental discount plan.

pZqgVmcMxdqyTK9XM7oqMQ,uUfbAM1-uw-JND13S2ERCA,t4qOPZKzNuAbTrF5JAvfbg,1.0,6,0,0,"DO NOT COME HERE--unless you want to leave in tears. This is the WORST salon experience I've had in a long time. I cannot stress enough that this experience was totally not worth my time, money, effort, or hair. 

1. The service: I called to make an appointment on a Saturday and mentioned to the receptionist that I had curly hair and wanted to have an appointment that day. I arrived and was paired with a stylist that was clearly COMPLETELY unprepared to cut curly hair. When the stylist realized that neither of us were uncomfortable with the situation, she offered to make me an appointment with the person at the salon who does deva cuts (a special type of haircut for curly hair) for two days later (today Monday, 13 March, 2017).  Normally, after a situation like this at a salon I wouldn't have come back, but my stepdad got me a gift card to this place and was insistent that I make another appointment as this is his and my stepsister's favorite salon. 
I called the salon earlier today asking to confirm my appointment time, when the receptionist on the phone couldn't find my name in the system she asked ""Are you sure you've called the right salon?"". Even if I hadn't called the right salon, this was not the correct way to approach the situation and it was very awkward for me to be on the defense and explain who my appointment was with and what time etc. 

2. The cut: I came to this salon for a deva cut specifically for curly hair and this is the cut that I am reviewing. I mentioned to the hair stylist right when I sat down in my chair for the consultation that I was growing my hair out and wanted to take of as little as possible off the length while removing as much damage as I could. Ashley seemed like she understood and shampooed me, dried my hair, and proceeded to cut. Normally in this type of situation, a stylist would confirm that the amount of hair they were taking off was okay, this did not happen during this cut. Ashley started cutting away without explaining what she was doing or why at all, which is very important to me during a cut. After my cut, I mentioned to Ashley that my hair seemed very short, but she told me to trust her as I had a lot of products in my hair which make the hair curl differently. I was then led to the front of the store where products are displayed and was prompted to buy deva curl products (which I said I didn't like) as well as another product all while I was still clearly shaken by the 4 inches cut off of my hair. 


Overall, I am deeply unhappy with the cut I received--I came into this salon with long beautiful curly hair and left with a sad shaped curly lob/bob. I even went home to wash my hair just in case Ashley was right and she really didn't cut that much off my hair. Surprise! She did. 

MAYBE, just MAYBE this would have been okay if I were happy with the shape of my hair but I am not. Final thoughts: I got this cut basically for because of a $50 dollar gift card (the cut was $61) against my better judgement and YOU COULD NOT PAY ME TO COME BACK HERE. Now I will have to go to my actual hair salon and have this mess corrected.",2017-03-14 03:00:25
GGiz9kk_Ik256fsZYLxrlg,jFqYag0C1PeWzABC3-1mVw,GW0b7o1wghFlQCoWv4zHgQ,1.0,0,0,0,"Went here around 7 pm on a Saturday with a party of 2. Only half the tables were occupied, but there were lots of people just waiting at the door. Surprisingly, we got seated quite fast even though there were many people ahead of us in line. We got seated in a booth close to the door. 

When we sat down, I noticed right off the bat that the florescent lights were uncomfortably bright, which kinda ruined the ambience even though they had a live DJ playing. The place looked generally clean, and the cheap decor had a Japanese theme to it. Also, the menu had some crazy bad typos in it, and was a bit confusing as some of the photos didn't match the description of what it was. 

Let me just say, I was really excited that this place was both a Japanese and Vietnamese restaurant. I was craving both sushi and pho at the same time. After going through the menu, I decided on green onion cakes to start, Combo C (assorted sushi boat), and pho to satisfy my odd cravings. 

But what a disappointment... we never even got to order the food. Even though we got sat quickly, the service was nonexistent. Saw a few servers going around taking payments, but no one was around to ask us our order. I've worked in the hospitality industry myself, so I know what it's like sometimes, but there's no reason any table should have to wait over 20 minutes for even a drink order to be taken. Especially not in a restaurant that's half empty. 

The only reason why we gave them such a long chance to come by the table was because the nearby restaurants had too long of a wait time. But, looking back now, we would've been better off waiting at the other restaurants in line, instead of waiting at a table at Volcano for service. We probably would've been in and out faster than here. 

But, it wasn't just us not getting any service. We watched as a man went up to the host after 10 minutes of waiting at the table without menus, a couple sitting close by waited as long as we did without menus as well, and the people who were in front of us in line waiting for a table were still standing there. So many people were trying to flag the staff down. It was very very odd! 

Were they that severely understaffed? It didn't seem like it. It just seemed much too disorganized, and needed better management. I've never walked out of a restaurant from not getting service before, and I probably won't be walking back in anytime soon.",2017-02-12 10:01:51
8V1j4wfgtUC349FfPBTtNg,3UOOCUOLnPTd7gwWZolRgg,Qh-vuXF2kEVvj1ReRP_ztA,2.0,2,2,0,"We went here for a birthday last week and were a bit disappointed.  A table for a large party was reserved at 3pm for 5pm seating.  Since there were a couple of elderly people in our party, including the birthday girl, it was important that the table be ready on time and easily accessible.  Well, we kinda knew it was bad news when a bit past 5pm a hostess needed to talk to us.  The table was not ready and it would be about 15 minutes before they could seat us.  Now it was just 5pm and our party was all there just waiting around while people that were coming in early were getting seated because, you know, it was EARLY.  Finally, they showed us to our table and it was a booth with a table stuck at then end and extra chairs put around the table.  Needless to say, the person who showed up at 3pm to reserve this table was not happy.  The younger folks slid into the booth and let the older folks sit at the chairs at the end.  
Our service went fine from there except because of the now 10 foot long booth, the server couldn't put down our plates or glasses and everything was handled several times by guests as they were passed down yonder to the people at the very end.  Luckily, nobody needed to use the restroom as it would have forced the entire table to evacuate.  
The food was good and there was plenty, I'm pretty sure everyone liked their meal.  
It was time to bring out the cake, which was brought in earlier and hidden in the kitchen.  The server was asked to bring it out and she did....still in it's bag, and in the bakery box with the candles taped on the top in an envelope marked candles. She plopped the entire bag down in front of the birthday girl along with a stack of plates and forks.  Gee thanks.  Most servers know that when they bring out a birthday cake it's best to take it out of the bag and box, put the candles on it, light them and bring it to the table.  Isn't that how it's usually done?  
Well this time the bag had to be passed down the table to the person who brought it, taken out of the wrappers, candles put in, lit, and then passed back up the table to the birthday girl.  Kind of lost something in the presentation.  
BAD, BAD WAITRESS!
Then she and another waitress tried to get the birthday girl to get up and sit on a wooden horse and we had to yell at them to leave her alone.  Nice.

Of course, unless you're white or white-washed. Allow me to explain the second part. If you're not white but are assimilated into the SB American white culture, then you'll talk, look, walk the part. I stood out like a sore thumb because I wasn't one of the RVCA-wearing, Oakley-sporting, flip-flip walking, ""dudes"" that either looked like I just came out of the ocean or walked out of a high-end, vegan clothing store.

Swung by this restaurant with a few friends while I was visiting because I had heard that they had some pretty good dishes and after barely finding parking, we were able to get there just in time to see someone leaving and took over their table. At my friend's suggestion, I ordered their soup and waited while enjoying the California sunset over a few beers. My friends' orders came out after about 15 mins but mine didn't. So I waited while they enjoyed their meals. And waited. Finally, after thinking maybe they forgot to place my order, I went inside to check up on it. I waited by the bar for one of the 3 servers to come by. And I waited. I waited for about 20 mins. During that time, other people walked in and ordered and got their order, I made plenty of hand gestures, eye contact, directly talking to them, etc with no avail. It was as if I was invisible.

Finally, one of my friends walked in and got the attention of the waitress and shared with her their disappointment. She apologized. To him. Again, I didn't exist. After getting their attention and seeing where my order was (they ""forgot"" to put it in and said they didn't see me trying to wave them down at the bar), I went back to my seat and wait for my soup to come out. And waited.

My friend went in again by himself and after 5 mins, my soup was out. Maybe I had an off-day with everyone working at the restaurant but seeing that everyone else was getting their orders, getting friendly responses, and not being purposely ignored, I doubt I'll ever be back. And this wasn't exactly the first place to do this to me in SB.

My friends tell me that maybe it's because I look like a ""homeless"" person with my unkempt facial hair but I know that's just an excuse because there were plenty of ""homeless"" looking white men in there that got prompt service.

2 stars because the view was nice (though it's not necessary to be at the restaurant to enjoy the view) and the soup was decent.

Parking: Depending on time of day and day of the wk, you'll either find plenty of parking, or none at all
Price: $8+ per person
Wait: 15 mins if you're white, no service if you're not",2015-10-12 14:08:54
sM2G2TGe8fi0QaMsjj4HpQ,gonp8uRLxapkGu8xWFctyg,0tbscjPg4IzURekIn_CJ1Q,5.0,4,0,0,"great juice and i love that they are in glass bottles not plastic.  i also love that every day i got my juice it had just been pressed that morning (they only keep things on the shelf for 2 days max- but typically they sell out everyday so it's rare to have anything left over from the day before).  i juice at home and i am big on fresh pressed juice.  in my research i have read that the enzymes and nutrients in fresh pressed juiced begin to break down immediately- so that a juice drank right after pressing is very different nutritionally than a juice pressed 3 days ago (and most juice places will keep things on the self for 3-5 days)

i had all the green drinks that had no added sugar (fruit) in them.  i especially loved the liver detoxifier.  i tried some of the milks and they were too sweet for me :(  my husband liked them though.  wish they made at least one milk that was only sweetened with a little bit of date for those who are not into sugar bomb nut milks :p

only complaint is i think ginger should be offered for free for those who want a touch in their drink.  they charge $2 extra for ginger which is over the top.  50 cents maybe but $2?  i guess on other complaint is that when you pay with a credit or debit card a screen pops up asking for a tip and recommending 20%, 15% or 10%.  i used to be a server and i get the value of tips.  but when someone just pulls a juice out of a cooler and hands it to me- i don't think it warrants a tip.  perhaps having an option where if you want to put a tip you can would be better than forcing everyone to move through the tip screen first before you can sign your bill?  just a thought.  (and i did tip- which i would do on my own without being asked- but i give a couple bucks not 20% of the bill).  

i often travel with my juicer but this trip we were in a hotel with no kitchen so i found the nearest juice place- which was juice ranch- and was there every morning to pick up my greens for the day.  grateful this place exists!  will definitely be back when i am in SB again",2016-01-10 18:41:36

Personally I needed a decent place to lay my head that was conveniently located to the airport, I-95 and shopping. It meets those needs. So I sacrificed luxury and modern living for convenience. 

Let's face facts. These apartments are old and outdated. The only thing you will get New is paint and carpet. The cabinets are falling apart unless you are lucky enough to get the apartment you see on the website. I had to fix the shelves in mine myself. Manual thermostat that wastes energy because the heat and AC constantly run or don't run enough to keep the temperature. I also didn't know that it came with a neighbor who has an aggressive dog that barks at everyone who passes by the window. This dog an another neighbor's dog got into a fight right in front of the building. Did I mention the gnat infestation problem? Or how about the rodents that run through the ventilation system and sometimes they make it inside the apartment. Oh I forgot to mentioned the guy that was shot and killed in the parking lot in the day time. Saw the area taped off by the police but didn't know what happened until I saw the news.

Should I go on? Wells the people in the leasing office act as if you are bothering them when you ask them to do something like hmmm THEIR JOB! My stove wasn't working(would shut off whenever you tried to pre-heat the oven) when I moved in and the service guy came by 3 times before the problem was resolved. But the guy had an attitude with me because I complained about a stove that wasn't working when I moved in. How am I supposed to eat. Seems to be the attitude of everyone that works for this company. Except for one guy who worked in the office but I haven't seen him for a while so maybe he is gone. In any event my air conditioner only wants to work when the weather is nice enough to open your windows. But oh yeah I had to request to get screens put in before I can do that. So objectively I have to say that the best thing about living here has nothing to do with the apartment and more to do with location. You can catch a bus to the airport without having to pay for parking. Grocery store is a 5min walk and you are less than a 5 min drive to I-95. They do keep the grounds nice and manicured but If you want more than that keep looking. 

I am active duty military and have lived many places and I have never experienced such a lack of regard for people once you sign the lease. When I was a perspective, I felt like a college recruit everyone wanted to sign m. But after that, garbage! I would never ever ever live here again or any other place managed by this company. Worse experience ever! I wish I could give zero stars! The final straw was then deducting a $131 from my deposit for a water bill I paid! At least the person I spoke to named Colleen Mazzoni was nice and pleasant although I don't feel the final result was not what I expected. They kept my money and I don't feel it was accurate but I'm 1000 miles away now. 

Pros:
- Gym in leasing office (descent for light workout)
- loaner bikes
- Close proximity to shopping (grocery, auto etc)
- Grounds are well maintained

Cons:
- Old outdated bathroom/kitchen/thermostat 
- pesky insects (gnats mainly) & rodents (yuck!)
- poor customer service at leasing office and poor response for maintenance
- no security on the premises(cameras, police drive through)
- parking lot floods when it rains
- no central lock mailboxes (packages are stolen when left at the door)
- you have to use PayPal to pay your water bill and you get charged a fee to send money...they don't tell you that up front.",2018-01-04 19:59:52

1) It's Pet friendly. $15 Pet fee, one of the lowest in all of Nevada. This means we can bring Cuddle Monster.

2) It's REALLY Cheap! Mid week it is only $24/night + $4.99 resort fee. Hell Motel 6 on the same night costs $48 and it don't come with free play coupons. They also give you $5 off each additional night with a coupon - a 20% savings!

3) Free play coupons and CHEAP Blackjack. When you check-in you get a coupon book. The only good coupons are pretty decent, $10 bonus with equal bet, and $5 bonus. This means you place your equal bet and if you win you get that extra amount. You can use it on Blackjack (which they got single deck $2 Blackjack BTW - a great way to enjoy free drinks while losing maybe $20 over 2-3 hours) or roulette or whatever else

4) Cheesey Players Club - The designer who made the posters to promote the players club had some fun. They have stupid reward names like ""Party Crasher"" and ""Top Dog"". There is this awesome poster in the elevators that shows if you make it to ""Top Dog"" you get $4 off the buffet and the fake name on the card is ""Emma Gambler"". I always laugh. I hate to think people actually enroll in there cards and gamble with them for comps at this place. Anyways the whole system gives me a good laugh.

5) Close to Tahoe, and Circus Circus. A great cheap vacation: Go to the lake in the day, then at night (arrive at like 8 or 9 and arcade closes at 11pm) hit the Circus kids games. They are all the carnival fair games only slightly cheaper, and really fun when you're really trashed. I personally recommend going to Taco Bell (one of Reno's best Tex Mex (yelp) rated QSR's) upsizing to the plastic cup, and hitting up the old LC right next door to get your baja blast a little...blasted! Well anyway makes for a good night and after all that drinking the fact that the beds are hard, carpet stained, and hotel so dated will not bug you! 

If your looking for fancy hit up the Peppermill, if you want cheap as can be this is your place. Good luck!",2014-08-04 00:54:26
RRqyzKLVmuaplezMnJ30rA,wmEk-exSH0g6ouWEGYgu8A,9PXJkRLVWd6IMPfBzdJp2Q,1.0,3,0,0,"NEVER, EVER, EVER again will I book a room at the El Con! It is a ""con"" job...that's for sure!! My girlfriend and I, both disabled, had the most stressful spa getaway weekend of our lives! I am fighting numerous health issues including seven autoimmune disorders and extremely brittle diabetes as a necrotizing pancreatitis survivor. It is difficult for me to travel because of my many health issues and constant concern with how I will receive meals. I was delighted to be able to make these plans after 2 years involving lengthy hospital stays (to celebrate just being alive) but was in tears by the end of my weekend....

NOTE: DO NOT MISS THE SPA. Lydia is phenomenal. But save yourself the headache, book through Groupon, and stay at a Motel 6 if you want better hotel mgmt and service. The grounds are gorgeous but this is Tucson... that's par for the course for these resorts! I can look at mountains and beautiful grounds at home.

1). I booked TWO Spa packages for 2 nights which included charcuterie boards and souvenir size champagne (though neither of us drink). They gave us one board and 1 bottle of champagne. We had to ask for crackers because they forgot (even though a cheeseball was included). When I inquired about the 2nd board on Saturday, they had a hostess call to tell us they would not be sending it and made a reference to the idea we were trying to overindulge in the alcohol. No, we were more interested in the charcuterie board before our spa appt because we were starving.

2. This is not an ADA or handicapped friendly environment. There is A LOT of walking to get to rooms, the lobby, spa, etc. I was told my requests to be placed near an elevator and other accommodations would only be honored if we booked an accessible room. When I contacted Hilton Cus Svr, the front desk lied to Hilton and said they couldn't switch rooms because they were totally booked. There was ONE wedding booked on Saturday and it was completely dead on Sunday.

3) There is ONE restaurant open on the premises and it only serves rooms on Friday and Saturday between 5-9PM. Everything else had to be picked up and we would have had to drive all around 3 buildings to get to the restaurant near the lobby (I have mobility issues due to chronic lung conditions that cause extreme fatigue.) They didn't care.

4) A breakfast was to be included but no one cared to inform us of where it would be held. When I contacted the Front Desk (Augustine), I was told I could find a copy of the breakfast menu on the website.. No... only broken links there. He argued with me and finally someone came up and threw a menu on the floor. Hilton Cus Svc asked if I asked about this. No, I did not because in all of my years of traveling (US and Int'l), especially for spa getaways and secret shoppings, I have NEVER had to ask for amenities that were supposed to be included in the overall package. My bad.

5) The dinner meal offerings were meager and of a bar/grill nature...many of which I cannot consume. We tried Door Dashing it...

6) Door Dasher was not allowed to deliver food to the room...so I had to retrieve my Sat breakfast delivery from the lobby. Even though I drove, it was stone cold.... cold eggs.... great.

7) I was advised by the front desk and Hilton CS to make my own delivery arrangements closer to the room. Ok... I did....I told him I would meet him outside our gate.

8) The Door Dasher was stopped driving in the parking lot and told to leave it at the front desk. No one informed me. By the time I got to the lobby, $90 meal...stone cold. 

9) Do you know what it is like to have low blood sugar? On vacation? Because you cannot get a secure meal plan????

10) The rooms were musty; some areas could benefit from more attention. There was hair on the bathroom floor. No vent in the bathroom. The toilet seat broke from regular use (cheap, cheap plastic...my hubby is a plumbing professional... I know cheap when I see it.) Cheap, cheap bathroom amenities (you'd think they would have provided spa product samples. Who does the marketing?)

11) I called Hilton Cus Svc 4 times during my stay. I was given a case number on my last contact and told I would hear from someone in 3 days (even the email said so). Day 4, I called and was told I had to wait 3-5 days. I called on day 7 and was finally offered some options to make up for the poor service... but I refuse to take chances on a $1000 hotel booking ever again. Hilton is usually an exceptionally well run organization but this place is dragging their name through the mud!!

12) The wifi is HORRIBLE!! Not for business purposes!!

13) Don't take my word for it, read MANY of the other reviews which, I see, mgmt didn't care to respond to.  I sure should have.

Bottom line... I understand pandemic difficulties but nasty and disrespectful attitudes by staff have nothing to do with that. If you charge pre-pandemic prices and resort fees, you should provide pre-pandemic service.",2021-09-28 01:32:32

Let me start off by saying that the hostess on staff was extremely rude and unfriendly. My boyfriend and I arrived before our other friends so I went inside to put our names on the list. I told her that there was four of us in our party and she said it was going to be about a 45 minute wait. Since we didn't make reservations and it was a Saturday night, the long wait was expected. Once our friends arrived we thought that we would go into the bar area to grab some drinks while we waited for our table to become available. We found two open seats at the bar so me and my girlfriend sat down while the guys stood behind us. We ordered some drinks and started chatting...we were then rudely interrupted by a male server whole told us that we couldn't sit there because the hostess didn't seat us there?! I was confused, but I apologized by saying ""I'm sorry, we thought the bar stools were open seating."" He looked at me and said ""nope"" in a very rude tone. Since the restaurant and bar were packed we were forced to wait outside in the cold with our drinks. After waiting about an hour I walked back up to the hostess stand and asked about how much longer the wait would be. She looked at me, looked down at her reservation sheet and just walked away without saying anything?! Another hostess came over so I asked her the same question...right about that time the original hostess came back over and said ""I was coming right back...what's the name?"" I reminded her of my name and she said ""oh your table has been ready for a while now...we've been paging you."" I held up the buzzer that she had given me when I first got there and showed her that it wasn't buzzing or lighting up?! All she said was ""oops. must not be charged."" We were then seated at a table right by the door which was noisy and cold every time the door opened. The food was good, but our waitress barely ever stopped by the table to check on us, and when we finally tracked her down to get our bill (by the way she was in the back by the bathrooms chatting with some other waitresses) we were just ready to get out of there. With the poor service that we had all night we will definitely not ever be back.",2017-11-10 16:39:55

It's out of the way, and honestly if you don't know the back roads, it's a little bit of a hairy drive!  In any event, our good old GPS found the place, and it only turned out to be about a 20 minute ride from our home.  Very nice looking from the street with ample parking behind the restaurant.  Very friendly hostess told us there was about a 15 minute wait, we got lucky and got a seat at the bar.  Another very friendly person, the bartender (didn't catch her name) was extremely pleasant and helpful when my hubby couldn't decide on which of the extensive draught beer offerings he wanted.  Sure enough, about 15 minutes later, friendly hostess escorted us to our table, asking if it was our first time here (it was) and telling us about the new owners and how they opened this past summer, etc.  The dining room consists of a mix of tables and booths and is cozy without being crowded.  TV's are scattered throughout the bar and restaurant so you can catch ""the game"" wherever you are seated.   Server (forget her name) was very pleasant, provided just ther right about of attention to us and kept our glasses full.  Nice menu selection, with a little bit of everything from appetizers, to full entres to sandwiches, salads, etc.  This ain't exactly the kind of place you would go for a gourmet meal, but if you are looking for nice casual pub fare, The Publick House has it right!  

We opted for the brushetta appy, it was delish and just enough to share.  Hubby had the salmon and I had the pasta with sausage, peppers and onions.  Both were yummy.  Portions range from average size (the salmon) to  very large (the pasta).  Noticed several other diners with burgers which were HUGE and looked absolutely delish on a toasted Brioche bun.  Definitely what I will get next time!  Shared a dessert of a warmed chocolate chip cookie, with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and chocolate sauce.  Again, HUGE and more than enough for two people to share.  On our way out of the restaurant, there was not one person who worked there that didn't say, ""thanks for coming, come again"" and you felt they meant it.  Nice touch.  Will definitely be back, but maybe next time, we drive there during the daylight hours!",2012-11-13 14:07:54

I'm really picky about my sushi and it's been 6 months since I've had it; I'm from Boston and was convinced I'd never have anything as good as my favorite place back home... until I experienced Fat Salmon. 
I did some serious recon on this place before I made a reservation. I walked by a few times (it's just around the corner from my house) and it seems like it's always packed- good sign #1. I popped by and got a take-out menu and was amazed by the wide selection and the creative, tasty-sounding rolls. The third time I walked by, I stopped in to make a reservation for the following week and met with the hostess, who was awesome. Even though they had lots of reservations for the time we requested, she put us down for corner seats at the bar and said that she'd work on getting us a table. 
So group of friends and I went out to Fat Salmon on Tuesday night and we were all very impressed. We were happy to find that we'd ended up getting a nice little table for four in the back. The decor was great; we really liked the wallpaper and the mural featuring the pieces of tuna and salmon sashimi was so cute. The service was excellent as well... whoever yelped that it was bad must be mistaken. Our waitress, Jessica was extremely attentive, friendly, polite, and personable. The three of us were waiting for our fourth to arrive, and she came over to tell us that she'd try to put our order in before a 6-top that had just arrived because she didn't want us to have a long wait. She helped us choose our dishes and gave great advice on some tasty rolls that we ended up completely devouring. Needless to say, she got a big tip.
Best part: It's a BYO, and if you bring cold beverages, (i.e., Asahi super cans) they'll keep them in the fridge until you're ready to imbibe. If you bring Sake, they take it back to the kitchen, warm it up, and bring it out in a lovely serving set for you.
The food: everything was hands-down delectable.
The four of us had green tea, our alcoholic beverages, some edamame, and miso soup to start with. The miso soup was some of the best I've ever had. Even my friend (who might be considered an expert in Japanese culture and cuisine) was impressed.
We ordered the following rolls and ate every single piece:
Hako Sushi, Rock and Roll (SO DELICIOUS), Yellow Tail Roll, Enkai, Spicy Tuna and Spicy Tuna Crunch (can't go wrong), Spider Roll (my favorite!), and Shiitake roll (decent). The best part is that it was all so tasty, and so affordable! I'm definitely going to become a regular at Fat Salmon and I highly recommend it to any sushi aficionados out there. Grab your chopsticks and enjoy!",2010-05-01 02:15:42
XIjIOwnuE84Z5_jXaTQl0Q,a7p3LylaCrW4BaCFrPAuXQ,Kya7-ov8E4a6UiP5EbuO9w,4.0,0,0,4,"I highly recommend getting the VIP pass if you want the ultimate experience. For example, you don't have to wait in line, you get a discount to the Al Capone speakeasy and you get nifty gifts such as the badge necklace, miniature flashlight and free photo. My favorite part of being VIP, is that the ""monsters"" and employees are aware of your status because of your badge. They then make sure you are in the front of the line/group and get the ultimate scares first.

If you are unsure about spending so much money on the VIP pass, keep in mind that the proceeds are donated to the prison/museum to keep it functional, open and to preserve its historical look.

The actors for the monsters are very talented. A couple of them made me jump and scream. There will be a guy with a chainsaw who may chase you and try to saw your legs. However, the main scare for me would be the loud sounds, eerie environment and the fact that you don't know what will pop out or what is coming next.

The VIP pass also comes with a group tour of the penitentiary, with a tour guide who is very knowledgable and talks about the history; they are very informative and answer all questions. Be careful maneuvering around staircases and the basement, you may trip down the stairs or bump your head on the low ceiling if you are not careful. 

My only complaints are the portable potties are the only bathrooms that are available. Be sure to bring hand sanitizer. The gift shop is cool and there is a section where you can watch documentaries of the prison; they need to update their televisions because they are old-fashioned and tiny. But, I guess it suits the overall scenery. The food is very plain such as chicken tenders, fries and the alcoholic drinks are just okay.

Lastly, be sure to wear your jacket because it can get chilly. If you wear the glowing necklace (allows monsters to touch you and separate you from the group), I do not recommend bringing any large purse since it may fall over or be a hassle to carry around. A small purse with long body strap is fine. If you choose not to wear the necklace, any purse would be fine. Just keep in mind that you will be walking (maybe even running and screaming!) throughout the entire time.",2015-10-26 21:27:46
Mk3Jy9pWdZDKGNvASwQQSw,SGsrQi2EMi-ZFaYy0OeXRQ,AlxnbBd2JNkozNvI0OvRLQ,2.0,1,1,0,"Myself, a friend and our combined 2 kids had just arrived in Philadelphia the day that we dined at Murph's. We decided we were all craving pasta, so we hopped on Yelp to find some place that served a white sauce selection. I spotted one of my faves on the their online menu: fiocchi pear pasta with a white sauce (I think it was parmesan). Sold! We called ahead of time to check on the wait & verify under 21 was allowed. They do not take reservations for a party of only 4. All good, so we requested our Lyft and headed over. Once inside, the 1st noticeable thing that stood out was how small the inside was. The seating area is quite small. Maybe 8 tables? I didn't count. Next was how loud it was. We had to speak very loudly to hear each other. Still all good, so we put our name & was told the wait would be approximately 60-90 mins. I asked if they would call us when our table was near ready. I was told no, but that I could call over to check on my status in line. I had my son set an alarm for 45 min, and we left to find a more quiet space to wait. When I called and asked about our status, the woman rudely told me that I was not allowed to do that & I'd lose my place in line if I wasn't in the building when my name was called. We walked back over immediately (5 min walk). About 15-20 min later, someone was yelling an indistinguishable name in the loud bar. We were standing right in front of the hostess podium, clearly waiting for our table. The waitress walked around us to get behind the bar and walk further away to yell the name. I finally left the hostess podium and walked over to the bar. I had to somewhat go behind the bar so that my voice would carry over to the waitress. I asked her if she was saying ,""Malia"", and she said, ""I dunno. Maybe!"" She wouldn't look at me. I could tell right away that she was being passive-aggressive. She seated us & let us know she was our server. She seemed super annoyed that she even had to speak us. She was also very rushed, and again, did not even look at us as she spoke. When she came back to get our orders, she was very snippy & rudely corrected our mispronunciation of certain Italian dishes. She left so fast that she forgot to get my son's order. When we called her back, she of course acted like it was our fault & said she wondered why he wasn't ordering food. B.S.! We saw her go up to other coworkers and roll her eyes & talk badly about us and other customers. We weren't the the only ones that she was rude to. Lastly, we asked for dessert to-go to which she replied, ""we don't do dessert to-go"", sounding appalled. My friend asked for a dessert and a to-go box. She spun off annoyed to get it, but not before stopping at the hostess podium 2 feet away from us and again rolling her eyes while barking at the hostess, ""DO NOT get them silverware! They are taking it to go!"" Dessert came, and  I asked the server, ""hi. I know you were told not to give us silverware, but can we have a fork to push it into the box?"" She nicely brought us a fork. The extremely rude waitress had dark hair in a ponytail with bangs, glasses and lots of tattoos. The food? VERY DELICIOUS! I very much enjoyed my pasta. It's too bad the service was hostile and it ruined our yummy food. I would not return there no matter how good the fiocchi is!",2019-03-14 22:27:07

Upon arrival it's unclear how to actually get into the building and we had to drive around the whole place. This gave us the first warning. Their exterior decorations are covered in rust and clearly neglected. We overlooked this and found the entrance. 

Upon entering there was no host to greet us and we stood around for a few minutes before anyone deigned to say hello. Second warning but we troopered on. 

The host tried to seat us only to realize an entire section of the place hadn't been cleaned. I'm not talking a table or two that we're just vacated. 5 booths and 5 tables were covered in dirty dishes. We'd been on property five minutes at this point and no one had left. We should have left immediately but we were hungry.

The chips and salsa were... they were that's for sure. I think the salt shaker broke over the chips? The salsa was from a jar, tostitos if I'm not mistaken. Sadly this might have been the best part of the meal.

My friend had the chicken quesadilla and I had the margaritas famous taster substituting chicken in the taco. First things first the food clearly sat under a heat lamp for 15-20 minutes before being brought out to us. Both plates were extremely hot to the touch along the top rim and cold on the bottom (I checked). 

The quesadilla was crispy to burnt on top and soggy and lukewarm on the bottom, watery inside and the chicken wasn't under seasoned it just wasn't seasoned. 

The famous taster should be called infamous. First I had a shredded lettuce garnish??? On the plate. Not sure what was going on there but hey not everyone is great at plating so oh well. My refried beans might have been baked... last week? They were a lumpy, crumbly, overall disgusting mass of beans. The baby chimi was a rolled up chicken and cheese quesadilla. Again the chicken wasn't seasoned and the cheese was cheese in name only. The rice was dry but covered in sauce. I'm not sure how that's possible but it is so that was interesting. Also the sauce is bland at best but more likely to be a criminal insult to Hispanic rice recipes. And the granddaddy of all. The enchilada. So first there were burnt sections from the heat lamp but the cheese inside (that's all there was) was only half melted, gritty, and rubbery. The sauce was horrid.

I can not recommend that people stay away from this place enough. We will never be returning and will tell everyone we know to never go.",2019-11-02 19:33:52

I didn't even have a massage, paid $60 just for the pleasure of using the facilities, and considered the money to be well spent. Besides being gorgeous in decor and comfort, the spa at Atlantis offers many somewhat unique ways to pamper oneself. There is the Laconium Relaxation Lounge in which one wrapped in the elaborate two-colored robe provided can ease back muscles and just reflect while reclining on a heated lounge. And, the Brine Inhalation Therapy Room, where a person can watch brine crystals change color while reclining on a well-padded lounge. Outside on the roof of the hotel, there are more comfortable lounges with latticed fabric covers overhead to offer some shelter from the sun's strong rays. A cold plunge and a warm spa and a hot spa are situated directly in front of the lounges. 

These are not your typical whirlpool spas! Each has an optional waterfall feature that can be dialed on or off. When on, a wide arc of water cascades downward in a predictable line so that a bather can maneuver his or her body in such a way that both the chest and back, or just the back, can weather some of the impact. It is of course also possible to remain in the spa and be completely out of range of the waterfall. Jets abound, including a couple at ankle and wrist level. This experience was relaxing and stimulating at the same time, and I spent well over half an hour immersed in the swirling waters. 

Even more dazzling was the Nature Experiential Shower just beyond the spas. In this door-less but walled individual shower, one can dial up a torrential Thunderstorm, Tropical Rain, Waterfall, or Ice Fog, and that is what you will get! The Thunderstorm setting comes with sounds of thunder, and the Ice Fog is accompanied by blasts of trumpets that sound like that of heralds welcoming the arrival of their king. No body wash or shampoo are present, for this shower is not for cleaning. It is for washing off chlorine while enjoying immersion in various manifestations of water. I spent a good 15 minutes in this novel shower. 

Everything described thus far is situated in the coed areas of the spa, which is great, because for double the price, these restful features can be enjoyed with a spouse, as Diane and I did. Then, after 2 hours, we split up to independently sample the offerings of the separate Men's and Women's sections of the spa. Here, besides dressing and grooming areas, one will find a Tea Room, a large Herbal Steam Room, and a Cedarwood Sauna. The steam room, which was all polished stone, looked lovely but only spat out steam in short, quite intermittent bursts. I found the all-wood sauna to be much more inviting and productive, with sustained heat and muscle soothing boards on which to sit, lay, or press back upon. Since my Casio solar-powered G-Shock sport watch chose to go blank while I was inside the sauna, I lost track of how long I remained in there. 

At the end of my third hour at the spa, I entered a fully functional, multi-headed shower that had features I never did totally figure out. Water temperature often automatically alternated between hot and cool. Perhaps the oddest thing is that the body wash, shampoo, and conditioner were all rosemary mint. And, the mint was noticeable enough that I imagined that when I left the spa I smelled like an elf with a wreath fashioned with minty candy canes resting on my hair. 

Next time I will add a massage, and perhaps bring my own shampoo and body wash!",2011-08-17 09:27:49

The practice name set of a warning in my head (""Beacon of Life"") but I failed to listen to my gut and paid a price. This place is run like a cult, and if you know how cults operate, the evidence is plentiful.
  
It started with the demeanor of the - cough - Doctor, the way she spoke, her body language, and the guided tour of the facility complete with testimonials from leaflets of dozens of alleged patients who experienced miracle cures from heart disease, ADD, hearing loss, allergies, etc, all thanks to chiropractic medicine.
  
I was in pain, rather severe, needed professional help, and received NOTHING (not even advice on stretches) after being there for about 90 minutes.
  
I went for aid and relief, but instead of helping patient, the staff spent most of the time trying to push a mindset on me (similar to a cult's indoctrination). I'm not new to chiropractic as a patient and know what it's done for me in the past for the same ailment, so my expectations were based on my own previous and successful encounters with real practitioners.
  
Here's the smoking gun: before I could receive treatment, help, relief from my pain, I was asked to come back in 120 hours/5 days, with the person with whom I share financial decisions (aka, spouse), so that a payment plan could be laid-out, agreed to, and even set up a financing plan if I had to, and THEN an appointment to get pain relief would be scheduled, (and to quote their literature) via, ""God's way."" Sounding cultish, yet? At the very least it's faith healing.
  

Where was the care? Where was the helping a person in pain? I arrived in pain, left in pain, but was invited to set up a payment plan? That's not any form of medicine I know of, nor does it resemble anything but capitalism in the guise of a cult.

Epilogue. 
I went to Dr Falcon in Trappe and IN ONE TREATMENT I felt much better - that is what I wanted. Dr Falcon has a Superb practice. Low cost; no financing required..

Massage, stim, heat, and adjusting. No meditation, no payment plan, no friends and family plan - just good ol' expertise and honesty.

We made a reservation over 24 hours in advance knowing we were going to have a large party of 14. We made our reservation for 5pm. When we arrived, 5 minutes early and checked in, we were told we could sit outside to be seated now or it would be awhile before they could seat us inside... even though we had a reservation. We had 6 kids so we opted to sit outside to not wait (which shouldn't have happened since we had a reservation). We then sat by 5:05pm and promptly ordered drinks and appetizers. Prior to apps arriving we ordered our food (4 medium pizzas, 1 kids macaroni and 1 side of apple slices- not an outrageous amount for 14 people).  20-30 minutes after ordering our waitress came out to say that it would be an additional 20 minute wait to the normal wait. After over an hour wait since ordering we were told it would be about another ten minutes and the waitress said she was going to make sure they took care of us. The manager then proceeded to come out 5 minutes later and tell us that the restaurant was busy and everyone was having to wait, rather rudely. No apology. No offer to make anything right. No matter of sympathy whatsoever. It is a Saturday night at dinner. I'm sure the restaurant is busy, but that should be expected. It always is. Over an hour and a half after sitting down, around 6:40pm, we finally received our food. We felt rushed to eat after being there for so long. We finally asked for our bills (and received them in full) with no other mention of our extreme wait or an apology for it. After arriving at 4:55 we finally were able to leave at 7:10. We love mellow mushroom but we probably won't come back to this location. Having to spend over 2 hours at a restaurant when getting there at 5 for a reservation is insane, but the poor poor customer service from the manager is what did it. I would recommend retraining. I would be happy to share his name, but he wasn't even polite enough to introduce himself when coming by our table. Not good etiquette.

Edit: the owner and assistant manager reached out to me and went above and beyond to right this poor experience. We appreciated the fact that they did care and it changed our whole thought about the location.",2020-02-23 00:35:50

Let's start with things I did not like. The Pho here is pretty standard, nothing special here. If you really want good Pho, you should probably go to a place that specializes in it. That being said, it is not horrible either...it's just standard. On the other hand, the Bo Luc Lac was off the mark, being slightly overdone and under-seasoned. Next time I go, I will definitely shoot for the fried squid instead.

Now on to the positive things and why this place is so great. What I really liked is their Banh Mi Bo Kho. I get Bo Kho at pretty much every Vietnamese restaurant and use that as a benchmark. The stew was quite exquisite. It was seasoned with a strange mix of herbs I have never tasted before in Bo Kho. It is an extraordinarily unique flavor that I urge everyone who goes here to try out.

Now, I am not much of a quail eater, but I quickly found myself eating through half the plate in no time. It comes with the salt/pepper/lime mixture, but the quail was so good on its own that the mixture went almost completely untouched. Also, we had some of the lobster and it was delicious. Can't really say much more about that since it is lobster...

The establishment was quite large and well maintained. It was reminiscent of some of the small mom and pop shops back in California, except it was about 4-5 times the size. The service was neither exceptionally great nor terribly bad. We got our tea refills in a timely manner. Our entrees came out at random intervals, instead of all together. The staff was friendly and answered all of our questions. For the price range, the atmosphere is exactly what I expected.

In the future, I will definitely check out their Banh Mi (since Philly has terrible sandwich shops) and their Nem Chua from the bakery.

In summary, everything that this place does well, they do it extremely well. Not everything on the menu is going to be the best you've ever eaten, but the good items will definitely have you wanting to come back--and ignoring all the stuff you didn't like =]. With the prices so low (the Banh Mi Bo Kho was about $5) and with certain items that are so good, this place deserves top marks.

El cortez is a staple on Whyte avenue. Providing a nice treat from the ordinary for atmosphere. Themed with the Mexican day of the dead decor. The space is dimly lit with chandeliers and Mexican trinkets all over the place. The booths are an outstanding fake pleather which really looks like snake skin. I have been seated on the uncomfortable bar stools before and the luxurious booths are where it's at. 

The thing that keeps bringing me back are the amazing daily specials. Everyday it changes...and they are always a great deal. Mondays for guacamole and chips with margeritas  on special. Taco Tuesdays to try the wide selection of tacos for just $3 a pop. Tequila Thursdays with half priced tequila shots. And of course my new favorite sangria pitcher sundays with churros. All the specials usually are priced for $4 to $5 which really are good deals. The drinks are not heavily watered down so you do get your money's worth. Although I find most of their drinks are on the sweeter side loaded with juice. 

I have to admit the guacamole is the best here. Huge chunks of fresh avocado, cilantro and lime are perfectly complimented with the chips. Seriously they always disappear quite fast. And I do order them every time I visit. They are that good. Ohhhh and the cornbread is to die for. Buttery, sweet and soft. It did not have that gritty taste to them at all. Probably the best cornbread I have had in my entire life. It was the best $4 ever spent!

But honestly brunch pleasantly surprised me. With 5 options to choose from all equally priced for $14 each. A great option for groups. (Super easy to split the bills). All the dishes came out looked small. But they were all so filling. So portions were large for brunch. I had the heuvos rancheros. A delicious open faced pork taco. Spicy and tasty it really was a perfect dish. The egg went so well with the dish and was cooked to perfection over easy. Literally too full for desert bit caved. I had to order the churros. Because they are my weakness. And el cortez does them right. Crispy and sweet they were a perfect ending to the meal. They also come with 4 peices and we're perfect for sharing. The caramel sauce was outstanding. I literally could drink it. It was done perfectly. And the red guava sangria was a perfect drink for sharing. Delicious and not overly sweet. Just be warned...those berries are loaded with liqueur. 2 glasses and I felt it.

So I must end this review that the brunch is stellar. Served Saturdays and Sundays from 11am-2pm.  It's a perfect time to catch the great happy hour specials too.  

The tuna ceviche I had on another visit was pretty good. Nothing spectacular. But I personally would stick with the items to share bc they are outstanding. 

Service was top notch and attentive. Everything provided for and attended to in a timely manner. In the evenings I find the servers to be a bit stretched out and too busy. Making wait times a little unreasonable. But for brunch, it was spot on. Definetly one of my top 5 brunch places in edmonton and quite well deserved. Delicious. My mouth is watering thinking of those caramel soaked churros and the delicious guacamole.",2019-09-22 18:08:16
k_8AiflXIws4uvNQy7iqvw,8VNmuYmFboXleIFf-stnFg,yZ-vvz96ekS2-zG_ZsyNLQ,4.0,7,7,6,"A recent report by the the World Health Organization has indicated processed meats such as bacon and hot dogs--as well as red meat--are bad for your health. This bit of ""news"" generated much debate amongst pundits and social media mavens, but I doubt this declaration will dampen America's appetite for burgers and bacon. In a fate-tempting coincidence, I and some family members visited the newly opened Scooper's restaurant on the same day the news broke. We're thrill seekers that way.

Scooper's original Sparks drive-in location has been a family favorite for decades, renowned for its award-winning milkshakes and made-to-order burgers. The new Reno location lacks the drive-in aspect, but there's plenty of seating in its large dining room. The place filled up pretty quick during our dinner-hour visit, striking for a place that had opened just days earlier.

The menu includes a variety of burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs, tacos, burritos, and deep-fried sides. All burgers feature fresh ground beef, special sauce, tomato, pickles, chopped onion, and lettuce. Similarly the dogs are all-beef and come with a variety of toppings. But there is one item I knew I had to order, if only because the description sounded like something you'd eat on a dare.

The Mighty Mike ($5.19) is a ¼ pound hotdog stuffed with cheese, wrapped in bacon, and then in the defiance of all that is healthy they deep-fry that nutritionist's nightmare and serve it on a bun loaded with chopped onion, yellow mustard, and mayonnaise. If you ate like this every day I'm pretty sure the heart attack would get you before the cancer kicked in. Having said that, it was pretty freakin' delicious. Even my health-conscious wife agreed it tastes far better than it sounds.

Moving over to the burger menu we sampled a Pastrami burger ($6.99), comprised of a ¼ pound beef patty topped with a ¼ pound pile of grilled pastrami and Swiss cheese. It was a little tricky to hang onto and almost juicy to a fault. The burger meat didn't taste of any particular seasoning other than perhaps a little salt, but the pastrami was nice and lean and the overall sandwich was pretty satisfying.

The Matterhorn burger was less drippy but no less enjoyable ($6.99), sporting a  1/2 pound of beef topped with Swiss cheese and plenty of thick-cut bacon. Most bacon served on fast food burgers is shipped pre-cooked and sliced so thin there's really no reason to bother with it. The bacon on this burger was probably the best I've tasted on a non-gourmet burger for under $10.

Fries ($2.29 lg), onion rings ($2.89 lg), and nacho chips with cheese ($2.49) were shared by all at the table. With these items the freshness aspect is lacking, as the rings, fries, and chips clearly came from a bag and the nacho cheese from a can. I lost my taste for frozen, minced onion rings years ago after discovering fresh onions dunked in beer batter. Luckily my six year-old niece was more than happy to take up the slack; I'm pretty sure she ate most of them.

Aside from fries and rings, the girl demonstrated there's more than one way to eat a corn dog ($1.69). Rather than starting at one end like a banana, she attacks it right in the middle and continues as you might eat corn-on-the-cob. Like the other fried items this dog appeared to have come from the freezer, but the hungry kindergartner declared, ""This place has really good food.""

But what about the award-winning shakes? They are indeed deserving of praise, featuring nearly fifty flavors including fruits, candies, and some that make my teeth hurt just thinking about them ($2.69 sm, $4.49 lg). My blackberry shake was thick and perfect without being too sweet, a perfect companion to our death-defying meal.",2015-11-12 08:20:48

The food was so unappealing. I've eaten at many a Chinese Buffet and they were all much better. This Chinese food tasted way off. Overcooked or old or something. So that's one thing. And they don't give you knives with their silverware. I thought it was just me but no one had a knife, we had to ask, and she acted pretty blasé about it. Sorry, if you serve meat (and even if you don't) shouldn't knives just be part of what you get automatically? The ice cream station was kinda dirty looking. I like the Jack and Jill ice cream itself- that was good. But a bunch of scoops in dirty water shouldn't be sitting out like that. I agree with another reviewer that a soft serve machine would be a good idea, much easier. Other strange things I noticed- waiter eating right in front of us at a table (I guess it was his break?), our waitress seemed to hover over us and felt like she was just watching us which made me feel uncomfortable (mind you there were many of us sitting at a long table, but she was just standing right there pretty much the whole time). Also the one waiter was yelling after my brother that he had to order a drink- fine, but don't yell after him! Walk up to him or better yet, ask politely or wait til he comes back! So weird. Also, some of them push carts around the floor to fill the buffet or take dishes etc. which is fine and I get it. But they're pretty rude about it- no apologies if they nearly ram into you. They just look at you like you're in their way even though they just push it with no regard. Oh- and there are signs everywhere telling you ""Do not waste food."" Uh, what?! Ridiculous. Don't tell me how to eat when I'm a paying customer. So customer service or just common courtesy based on this experience, for lack of a better word, sucked. And I've been to buffets where they're friendly and not like this at all. I don't know if they just don't realize it or just don't care, but not a fan. Don't remember if this place was always terrible- my dad had his birthday here in 2012 and I don't remember the food tasting awful, or the service being so bad. But oh boy, is it awful. Don't come here, I know there are much better buffets!",2016-08-14 02:18:05
LPz0MMgsTGGlaU67CQZK8g,jEmIvNFahyOdG-cVPrg2UQ,SRg4QRR7xQrZ6cp9u8VX9g,1.0,0,0,0,"Summary: POOR bartending, POOR wait staff, POOR management, DECENT kitchen time, DECENT food, but OVER priced and SMALL portions (got a small pizza on the way back to the motel after getting the chicken stir fry with vegetables $14.95, with a 6-7oz mojito for $8.50 LOL). The hostess were nice, the décor was good, and decent size TVs surrounding the bar( trying to be accurate in the good-mediocre things).

Part 1: Drink at the bar... One was enough!
I originally intended on going to firebirds for a drink or two and some good sit-down food (traveling on business and went alone). Unfortunately, their wait was too long (Friday night) so I walked back across the shopping center seeing ""Rated Best Asian Restaurant."" I went in and there were only a few couples waiting to be seated. I noticed an open seat at the bar and sat down to avoid any wait time. I watched the bar tender, manager, and 2 wait staff move about the bar for a good 5 minutes before the bartender finally took my drink order. I asked if they used real fruit puree for some of their cocktail beverages and she answered no, they used syrup. I went ahead and got a mango mojito and was ultimately very disappointed. I had several earlier in the week from various restaurants and this one was by far the least enjoyable. The white rum was not smooth, the lime wedge was squeezed in the bottom of the glass, the drink had way too much mint (had it clogging up my straw and ended up drinking it without) and the mango syrup was terrible. 

Part 2: Maybe get my order taken
10 minutes later the bartender asked if I wanted a menu to order something. Approximately 15 minutes later she asked if I was ready to order. Yes, of course I was... and my empty mojito was terrible not that she or the manager asked (both had walked by at least 10 times during this time). I eventually caught her making another persons drink in front of me and got her to get me tea. She didn't ask why I switched. The tea was mediocre at best. I did get my food relatively quickly, which is the best thing I can say about Potstickers in Newark. The food was decent, meat tender but not overly flavorful, and vegetables not over or undercooked. The biggest problem with the food was how small the portions are for how expensive it was!!!

Part 3: Please can I get my check!
After cleaning my plate and drinking all the tea. I sat around for another 20 minutes . The manager in the bar avoided interacting with customers, poured a few beer. The entire night he said nothing, had no personality, and was rude to his staff.

Surely there is better Asian cuisine out there in Delaware! I won't be going back!",2014-02-08 02:59:53
7IU972qqL5B9mCf4Bw2FBg,VBZtsp6RzWKWakZmFKpseg,8qvxtc9-VoWEuEpo9yxzQQ,1.0,1,0,0,"Never again.  We've shopped in different Kohl's stores over many years and each time felt a strange sense of relief when we were done and back out in the parking lot.  Today, they outdid themselves.  Hubby urgently needed a new pair of shoes but didn't want cheapies from Wal-Mart or Shoe Show/Payless.  Since he needed to stop in at Home Depot, anyhow, he figured that Kohl's might be worth checking out.  (Kohl's has never been a destination for us, we'd stop in only if we happened to be in the area.)  

The shoe department was neat, organized, and well-stocked and it took about ten minutes, start to finish, to find and try on a pair that he liked.  Then came the part we've always dreaded:  checking out.  It's rare to have it go smoothly, here.  We were greeted warmly by a very pleasant young woman and things started out fine, but then the receipt wouldn't print out.  The associate asked for help from the checker in the next lane, who made several suggestions.  Presumably, the first transaction ended up being voided, (there was no receipt for that, either) so hubby had to get out his card and swipe it, again.  Ordinarily, it wouldn't be a problem, but he'd just spent the better part of two days on our sun-drenched roof and in the hot attic, and up and down a ladder, replacing the attic ventilator fan, so his energy level was pretty low, and you could see him getting shorter, having to stand and wait for the problem to be resolved.  If we hadn't already had an appointment in Voorhees, we'd never have chosen to run errands today, but once you get out of Salem County, you try to make the most of it.

Anyhow, it turns out, their printer was out of paper.  This is ""working with printers 101"".  If It's not printing, first check the paper.  At some point, a manager came over, but I wasn't really paying attention, anymore, due to thinking more about how to catch my husband if he did fall over.  It was the manager who advised us that a receipt would take about five minutes to get (Say what?  These are _real_ computers that they're using, aren't they, not just dressed up calculators?)  After being assured that the second transaction went through, hubby just grabbed the bag and left without a receipt.  The employees seemed more interested in getting us our ""Kohl's Cash"", which we've never used, and have never wanted.  The store is an hour away from home; a small savings just doesn't make the trip worthwhile.  We left it there.

Still, compliments to the manager and employees for not getting rattled and especially for staying friendly and not getting snippy.  We understand that ""stuff happens"" and it's usually not the fault of the employees (although in this case some additional training may be warranted) so we were trying to stay calm and appreciate that they did, too.

I completely understand why brick and mortar stores are closing, and it's not entirely the fault of the ""evil, greedy online stores"".  Local stores, in large part, are doing it to themselves.  For example, there wasn't an associate in sight in the entire shoe department.  Our next shoes will be ordered from zappos.com, with their free shipping and generous return policy.  Kohl's is no longer on our radar.",2018-05-05 03:19:21

I began by explaining that I'm new to this, a defense mechanism in case I ended up asking her a stupid question.  She gave me a RBF that clearly said ""I don't have time for this.""  I asked about a particular strain--which their website said was in stock at this location--but I couldn't hear her because (a) she wasn't speaking loudly enough and (b) the music was pretty loud in there.  (I enjoy music in a shop and in fact, they play pretty good music here, but not sure why it has to be quite that loud.)  When I asked her to repeat herself, the eyeroll to end all eyerolls let me know that she and I were never going to take a cruise together. 

Forging ahead, she said they actually had two options available (like an eighth and a dime or whatever) which made her seem possibly more human:  Could she sense that I didn't want to purchase the large quantity that was advertised on their website?  I said I'd take the smaller amount and then she told me to take a seat and my purchase would be brought to me.  After a couple minutes, she called me back to the window (again, not speaking loudly enough) to tell me that actually, they were sold out.  Matters not what the website says, nor that the mouth of that very RBF had told me that it was in stock.  If she felt the least bit sorry for the inconvenience, she was being a real trouper about it.  

Tonight, I tried one of their competitors, a place called Ethos at 807 Locust St.  I'd been in that space before it was Ethos so I was expecting a very cramped experience.  I checked their site and found they have an enormous inventory so they must have more room than I was imagining. 
To my surprise, it's a beautiful space with some of the nicest people I've met in a long time.  Everyone was very helpful and attentive.  They had in stock what they advertised, so I was in and out of there in well under 10 minutes.  Ironically, when I told the lovely girl at the front desk that I was having trouble hearing her, it led to a brief but enjoyable conversation.  Quite the contrast.",2020-09-02 01:46:01

But that's it. 
The first night I was greeted by a newborn baby cockroach on my nightstand. The next day, one was in the shower. 

The ""upgrade"" given as a loyal and revered Bonvoy member was an Executive Suite with Club Access but A) to get to the club we had to go to an entirely different building and it took two elevator rides to get there. Fine.  But when we got there there were small bags of potato chips, two types of granola bars and that was it, no matter what time of day you arrived. All four days we were there the Espresso Beans were never refilled. I get that it's ""Covid Tome"" but have some imagination. At 5 pm, put out individually wrapped crackers, cheeses and veggies.
Small bottles of wine or something that makes me feel like a valued Bonvoy Member. 

And why is it that everywhere I went on the lobby, it smelled like Dank Weed?!?

The restaurant was a disaster. We had ""coupons"" for breakfast. The first day they handed us a menu with limited options, I get it. 
The second day we were shown to our table and TOLD there's the buffet, enjoy. 
I didn't want the buffet. There were no other options given. 
So I went to the buffet, which is more money than the ""meal tickets"" allowed for which is unexpected.
Here's what I found on the buffet: 
There were flies in the bread rack, the pancakes were, literally, cold and hard. The eggs were inedible and the sausage links were fry, overcooked and tasteless. The fruit cup was old, and was clearly from a previous meal.  And on the second day they made us get our own coffee and carry it to our table without providing saucers. 
There were no saucers to catch the coffee that splashed as I walked.  And other than someone Seating us and handing us a bill, no one ever came to our table.  I finally lost my appetite completely when I realized just how dusty and dirty the banquet seating and chair rail were. I'm pretty sure it hasn't been dusted since Louisiana was purchased.
And why, for the love of goodness are people in the portico selling weed?  I can tell you. Probably to service all the college kid's who were staying 8 to a room across the hall from us. Thank goodness we travel with ear plugs and a sound machine because we would not have been able to sleep at all otherwise. 
And finally, the bed linen. The comforter was stained with blood and looked and smelled like it hadn't been washed in months. Thank goodness I bring my own comforter and pillows.

They have a myriad of sauces you can choose from, you can even mix sauces together (try white sauce with pesto), or put one sauce on half and another sauce on the other half! Next is cheese, they have natural italian cheese, which is a mozzerella, only there's is made in part with buffalo milk in addition to cows milk. This makes all the difference, the cheese is much creamier and richer, and it's just plain delectable. They have a reduced fat option of this cheese as well, which is suprisingly hard to tell apart from the whole fat version, it's just a tad less salty. They also have a brined Feta, Bleu, a creammy Ricotta, and Daiya brand Vegan cheese. They have an obscene amount of meats! If you're a meat lover, then PizzaRev is where you need to be, to highlight a few are; their 3 different kinds of pepperoni, their pork roll (a higher quility canadian bacon), their aromatic sweet fennel sausage with layers of flavor like anise, and bacon, yes you read that right, BACON! My favorite ""station"" however is the veggie section, they have so many options, all their veggies look crisp, fresh, and vibrant in color. I love that they have artichoke hearts, capers, and cilantro amongst other unique options because it lets us play around with our food and discover new flavor combinations to love. They cook the pizza on a stone, I believe their oven is about 500 to 600 degrees so you'll have ooey gooey cheesy, steamy, pizza with perfectly crispy crust in only 3 to 5 minutes! All this for only $8.25!!! ($8.91 after tax, or $11.06 after tax with a drink! I eat here a lot lol) You can also build an entrée salad! For the same price you get to pick unlimited amount of toppings to pile onto your salad, they have cesar, ranch, italian, and fat free balsamic dressings, the latter is my favorite. The thing I adore about this establishment the most is their amazing customer service. Right when I walk in the door I'm greated with a smile and a, ""Hi, welcome to PizzaRev, how are you doing today?"" The employees are all super friendly and attentive. They genuinly care about their customers and want to see us happy. If they don't add enough of a topping, all you have to do is ask for more, and they'll graciously add more until you're content. It works like an assembly line with one person adding your sauce and cheese, while another adds you meats, and a third adding your vegetables. The process is so quick. The cashier is very friendly as well, whoever it may be that day. If you're dining in house they'll usually bring your pizza to your table. The men's bathroom is always very clean and stocked. So is the side bar where you pick up parmesan, pepper flakes, and oregano. They also have around 5 or more hot sauces to choose from. Definitely give this place a try, or not because you might becoame addicted like me. The food and service is amazing! And the whole resturant is always clean, tables wiped, floors swept, etc. If your gluten intolerant, they have gluten free crust as well. I've seen them make a couple while I've dined there and they really do try their hardest to minimize cross contamination. Their gluten free dough is $2 extra, however, thats a small price to pay for delicious pizza that won't upset your stomach. PizzaRev is amazing! Try them!",2015-06-24 19:06:44

Even on this trip I couldn't help but photographing some Cattle Egret that were present in the borrow pit wetland to the SE of the Visitor's Center.  Plus the forested area to the south west of the mounds is a great hold for interesting breeding and migrant birds as well.  

But I always knew I was missing something by not exploring beyond the birds, and had always promised that when the kids got a bit older we'd make a trip here.

My daughter is now 11, my son 8, and my daughter has studied pre-Columbian cultures in Mexico and has loved learning about them.  She was beyond excited to visit here when I told her of our spring break plan.   

What an incredibly under appreciated site this is, even though it is one of the ONLY 17 World Heritage sites in the continental United States.  In 1250 AD this settlement of 20,000 Mississippian Indians was substantially larger than London.  This Mississippian Indian community thrived, and may have at one historical point a century or two earlier than this, had 40,000 Cahokia inhabitants that learned how to specialize, trade and barter so that they could build a sophisticated society of interconnected and interdependent families, clans and groups.  European culture wouldn't have cities this sophisticated for a number of centuries after the Mississippian culture hit it's cultural apex.  

They were also tremendous mound builders, including the largest mound, called Monk's Mound because of monks that later inhabited the area living on a mound, but now it seems that they didn't choose to live on what is now known as Monk's Mound.  Still, the name sticks.  It is about 100 feet tall, and you can climb up it as long as you use the stairs (do not climb off path to protect this 1000 year old World Heritage Site of ""outstanding universal value"").  It is one of 80 mounds on the 2200 acre site.  The view from the top is surprisingly inspiring, and it doesn't take much imagination to think about the Mississippian Indian Chief in his habitation at the mound's top looking out over acres and acres of people under his rule.   

Besides the amazing Monk's Mound itself, the exhibits and displays in the fantastic Visitors Center are what steal the show here.  They contain wonderful artifacts, an overwhelming amount of information (which can be good and bad), some simply captivating life size dioramas of Mississippian Indian daily life, as well as a great scale version of the whole site in the main area of the Visitors Center.  

If you want to get the whole experience, see the movie before you do anything else, plan to spend the better part of a day, and dig deep into the exhibits at the Visitors Center before you go out and walk the mounds.  Because, besides Monk's Mound, the 2200 acre site just isn't that exciting.  It is just mounds you can't climb on in this wonderful green space.  In fact, even Monk's Mound disappoints in the amount of information that is on the site to help one understand exactly what one is experiencing.  

That is my main complaint.  Once you are out and walking the site, the vast information inside the amazing Visitors Center becomes less accessible.  Now, you can buy a $1.00 Cahokia Mounds Tour Guide, and it is well worth it, but for my money, I'd like to see more on site plaques with bite sized details of interest along the way as you walk.  It is a small criticism, and all it takes is time and money, I know.  

So the kids thought the walk was a bit longer than necessary.  We walked from the Visitors Center, to Monk's Mound, over to Woodhenge and back the Visitors Center past the Twin Mounds and across the Grand Plaza.  A few plaques with informational details might have made the mile and a half walk a bit more palatable for them.   

Overall, it was an amazing treat to dig into this native American cultural jewel, right here in Illinois, a site that I would bet most who don't live in the area have any clue about, nor understand how significant the site is.  Our three and a half hours were just about right for our Visitors Center and walk, but there is more to learn and do there, and I expect we will make a trip back to explore it again in two or three years.  It was that cool, really it was.",2014-04-26 20:13:45
CVAo_G5tt71Dm2vg7seOHA,nxNO7_6U2Nu90v0IdnEhIg,BXpLIJbMuWZ939foxtInTg,1.0,13,5,4,"Decided to try Diego's for takeout only, because Yelpers told me service sucked, and that the bar crowd is a bunch of wanna-be hipster-posers, and I listen to warnings such as these.

Fine.

I called to order. I could hear in the background that they were busy so I asked the waitress if she was sure they could handle a takeout order (I am sensitive to stuff like this because I waitressed for 5 years in my 20s). She said it was not a problem but that it would be a 45 minute wait. Fine.

My husband arrived 40 mins later to pick up our order. Someone brought it half-way out and sat it next to the Margarita machine. My husband sat there LOOKING AT OUR ORDER, WAVING HIS HANDS IN THE AIR AT THE BARTENDER and NO ONE HELPED HIM. This went on for 30--yes, THIRTY--MINUTES.

If this had been me, I would have walked out. Or, I would have waited for them to give me the order, dumped it on the floor, and then walked out.

My poor husband is a REALLY nice person, and frankly, it was one of those situations where he had waited so freaking long, and was so freaking hungry, that he just wanted his food.

Our total was $41 and change. We had graciously tried a number of menu items since it was our first time there. I had asked for a side of guac as well. My husband made sure to ask about the side. The bags were tied so he couldn't see in. They assured him it was there (it wasn't).

The place was packed with sloppy drunk idiots so my husband didn't argue and left.

When he got home, our meals were LEAKING OUT OF THEIR CONTAINERS. It was DISGUSTING. Half the food was lost out the container into the bag. 

The rest? Completely COLD since it sat for a half hour beside a margarita freezing machine! 

The taste? There was no taste. So how can I describe it? Cardboard? Sawdust? It was all dried out, cold, and was worse than public school cafeteria food. Absolutely nasty.

I called Diego's as soon as my husband got home and told them about the cold food, the missing side (that my husband went out of his way to make sure they included, and they lied about it), and the fact that it all leaked out of the containers into the bag, a feat that no takeout I have ever gotten has managed to do except crappy Diego's (and this includes SOUP from Wawa--yes, Wawa does a better job than a $41 takeout place). 

The manager, Shanna, didn't get around to calling back until 2 days later. She was  kind of apologetic but mostly defensive--a sign that I am not their first, or even tenth issue, why else be defensive?

She'd say she was sorry, then point out that they were so busy like it was an excuse. Then she'd say she wanted to comp us a drink, and when I told her I am in my 30's and married, and hanging with horny 20-year-olds at a bar is not my thing, she seemed to not understand why I didn't think Diego's was as cool as she did (even though she sounded as old as 45-50). 

I told her we just wanted a refund for the side they charged for that they never gave us, and a courtesy credit for the food that leaked out of our containers, and the fact that it was all cold after a 70-minute wait (I left the disgusting taste out of it because she was defensive enough as it was).

To me, it was more than warranted to be offered a partial refund. To me, I should not have had to ASK after I described what I did. 

Shanna's reply? She claimed our side was only $1 (though we were never given an itemized receipt), and she said it like I was in the wrong to dare ask her to refund $1 even if they charged me for something I didn't get, because it was only $1. Seriously? She was arguing me? I would expect such idiocy at Chuck-E-Cheese's, not at a ""decent"" restaurant.

I think she and I were on different planets because when I pay $41+ for takeout, and I am a new customer, who was made to wait 70 MINUTES, and half my food spilled out, and the other half was cold because it sat beside a cooling machine instead of a heat lamp, to me, that is the main issue. To me, that is a HUGE issue. The fact that they charged me for a missed side is only further embarrassment for THEM, not me. But the bottom line is, any decent restaurant would be appalled by such shoddy service, and would have comped someone for it, no questions asked.

The fact that Shanna was NOT appalled, is bizarre.

The fact that Diego's has Shanna using such judgement as ambassador for the establishment, tells me about the level of class they are capable of rendering.

In the end, Shanna showed all of the professionalism and fairness she could muster by refunding me $4 off my $41 meal.

$4 back for a 70-minute wait, leaky/cold/gross food, and a missing side.

It was an exceptionally awful experience. We will never go back.",2014-07-19 05:41:29
biMiLwsI7KO-wwX_xOKBhA,uo3RSQRMyXPCOrB_8CN3ow,SZU9c8V2GuREDN5KgyHFJw,3.0,1,1,1,"Note: average to 3.5 ish stars now 

I have been here several times now and I believe this will be my 5th time. Not sure where my reviews go or my check-ins go, but oh well.
 
Came on a cloudy and rainy day, but there was still a short wait. Each time I've come, I seem to always order their steamed clams (served in a white wine garlic broth). Aside from that, I've had their cioppino and crab cakes as well. This time, I've also had a bowl of their England style clam chowder and Shrimp and Scallops Pasta (sautéed in butter, garlic, shallots, white wine, and sun-dried tomatoes over linguini.
 
The first to come was the bowl of chowder. A sizeable amount and looks 'right'. It was nice to have something warm and thick due to the weather, but taste-wise, the chowder falls short. The chowder, in my opinion, has the right consistency, but lacks in flavor of clam, cream, and salt. The menu says the chowder has bacon in it, but I didn't identify any pieces of bacon. Perhaps it's just the fat from the bacon? There are chunks of clam (not many) and some pieces of vegetables such as potatoes and carrots. What erred me a bit was the two large pieces of bay leaves in the chowder. Bay leaves are debatably edible or not - up to one's perspective. However, I would have preferred to not have the two bay leaves in the chowder and would have thrown  them out instead of serving them in the soup. One can argue they didn't see them, but the bay leaf was the first thing I saw sticking out of the soup when it was served. Next, the pasta and clams came. In the past, the steamed clam came with an additional bowl for shells. I'm not positive if there is a change, but they didn't provide one this time. Luckily, we just used the chowder's bowl instead of putting them on the table. For the 5th time I've had the clams, I'm starting to think the item is worth it only for the amount of clams now. The taste profile has gone downhill that I can't appreciate it as much anymore. The white wine can be a little strong, but that is meant to be balanced by cooking the alcohol and adding tarragon into it. However, I personally think the tarragon is too much and the white wine broth could have been cooked a bit longer to evaporate the dryness out a bit more. As a whole, it has a very strong flavor, which can be very appealing, but the flavor itself wasn't too balanced. In addition, I believe they used to serve two pieces of bread with the clams, but they provide only one now. Lastly, the pasta dish. I knew the sauce is a buttery-garlic sauce, but we both felt the dish was on the dry side as well as lacking sufficient butter and garlic. The garlic and shallots used were whole pieces so the garlic taste does not permeate the entire pasta dish. If the garlic was diced, it might help it some more. Aside from that, I don't think enough white wine and butter were used as the linguini wasn't coated evenly. The biggest flavor came from the sun-dried tomatoes and the shredded cheese. The shrimp and scallops were ""fresh"" and didn't taste bad, but they were completely bland. To me, I didn't think the seafood were great, because they were devoid of the taste of seafood - the scallops were bland and lacking a sweet taste to it, but at least not rubbery like overcooked scallops. The shrimp were mostly bland, but again, not overcooked luckily.
 
Service-wise: hit and miss. Sometimes the server is happy and sometimes they are very gruff. This time, the service was very gruff and everyone that worked that day appeared to not want to be there. I understand and don't mind it too much. This review is still purely based on the food.
 
Overall, I am starting to reconsider whether the place is worth coming back repeatedly. I am willing to try a sandwich/roll item from here. Everyone seems to get that instead of what I get or a Dungeness crab. I wouldn't get a crab, but a lobster or crab roll maybe. Up to each their own and I believe they are worth a try if you haven't been and it's on Stearn's wharf, which isn't a bad stop and visit tourist location.",2019-02-07 23:45:15
xe0rkPWMjuishVVqSvJ6uQ,5McpXnGm1iDAM_-UMpUR4w,h7d_Gl_hX7pa37kknrA-eA,3.0,2,0,1,"The old Mainland Inn was a favorite of ours, so we were very pleased to hear it had re-opened, albeit with different ownership. While our experience overall merits a return visit, there were some pretty big execution errors along the way. When we arrived no one was at the host stand, and it quickly became obvious that he was doing double duty seating guests and delivering food on occasion. Once seated it took an unusual amount of time for someone to greet us, but we also figured out real fast that the service is very slow. 

The dress code for the staff (other than the host) is dreadfully casual. Jeans, unpressed shirts, no tie, etc. To be perfectly honest, when our waiter arrived I honestly thought he was a busboy. He did turn out to be very pleasant and helpful, but for an Inn that has always felt very upscale, I thought the staff dress code was embarrassing. 

Nevertheless, we press on. We ordered cocktails (gin martinis) only to be told they don't carry our brand of gin (Bombay Sapphire.) Seriously, what restaurant in the US with a bar doesn't stock Sapphire? They offered an alternative which was passable. We ordered our first coarse, I had the sun choke soup with lobster and bacon which was quite good, and my wife ordered what they called the beet carpaccio salad. When she received a green salad we said we thought she received the wrong salad. They apologized and said they would bring the correct salad right away. However, we subsequently figured out that this was the beet salad, the few beets that were there were buried deep under tons of greens. We were told that the kitchen ""changed the plating on them"" which confused even the staff. (And for a beet carpaccio salad, this was really dumb plating.) Again, folks, know your menu. We sure don't, and it's really bad when even the staff doesn't know which dish is which. 

For entrees my wife had the stuff chicken which was amazing. I had the pork chop, which while cooked to a perfect medium, was spectacularly underwhelming in terms of flavor. One of the things we loved most about the ""old Mainland"" was their sauces, so I was longingly hoping that would be the case again. Sadly, not so. What little was there (very little) was unimpressive. Honestly, I've cooked better chops at home on my grill. For desert we shared the apple cobbler, which, while flavorful, did taste like it had been sitting around for quite a while.

The final frustration came when the bill arrived and they charged me for 2 beet salads, assuming they had started a replacement but never adjusted the bill. They quickly removed the duplicate, but, again, great restaurants don't make basic mistakes like this.

Again, I think we would return, but after a year in business, I was really surprised to see that the staff seems very untrained or perhaps a bit disorganized and the food is very good but not remarkable. Around us we heard several others working to straighten out issues with their orders as well, so perhaps they need some more ""burn-in"" time or some better front office management. If nothing else, for goodness sake, tell your staff to lose the jeans and wear a clean, pressed shirt and tie. We're paying good money to be there, impress us.",2016-01-05 01:20:15
lyfxN7gxOi8TGXY0Afs7pw,LsaoxdqREqnjsYit9ybwKg,M0r9lUn2gLFYgIwIfG8-bQ,5.0,0,0,0,"After two visits to Range, I feel it necessary to write this positive review. I work at another establishment in downtown St. Louis and I understand how difficult it is to cater to the downtown crowd - it's a strange mix of folks and, at times, a rather choosy bunch.

That being said, the two times I have dined at Range were two of the most enjoyable and tasty meals I have had all year long. Since the second visit was just as good as the first, I feel comfortable that they have established a consistency that can be hard to achieve when opening a new business.

Reasons why you should choose Range:

1. Great staff - They are always staffed with plenty of employees to meet the needs of the customers, and we never felt ignored or forgotten. Our servers were both very informative, helpful, polite, and attentive. The bartender remembered us from our previous visit and gave a, ""Thanks for coming back to see us again, guys."" That is something that I find incredibly important in a restaurant. The employee recognized us, thanked us for returning, and in doing so made us feel valued. Well done!

2. Great food - Both burgers I had were fantastic. The first was the LGBT - lettuce, goat cheese, bacon, and tomato on a beef patty - and it was just what it needed to be: flavorful and filling. The second was the Morocco - lamb patty with feta, arugula, caramelized onion chutney, onions and tomatoes - and it was better than that last one. And if those aren't your thing, they have burgers of many varieties, serving beef, chicken, lamb, and pork, with loads of delicious toppings and condiments. The fries are fantastic (housemade ketchup and lots of sauces to choose from) and the two sides we had, the potato salad and cole slaw, were some of the best we've had. And to top it all off, the two desserts we had, a banana split and Bailey's brownies with caramel ice cream, were seriously delicious.

3. Great atmosphere - There are two seating options: community style at a long table on the ground floor or at the bar and smaller tables on the second floor. The community tables are a nice departure from traditional dining and provide an easy way to engage fellow diners. The design is simple and clean with a wall of old mismatched windows in front of the kitchen. The decor was thoughtful but simple and the lighting was just right.

Range is everything it claims to be - delicious burgers, fine shakes, and a few more tasty things in between. With great prices and great service, Range is well worth a visit. I'm confident you won't be disappointed.",2011-12-18 20:34:33
HZAOOWIzzOwqSwfAITnpQg,9iHYF9ewYhqjXM-4DQP1Pw,sXNh9X0jBiRtIb5a6xWWHQ,3.0,2,1,1,"I hate that be the person who just leaves a nothing but negative review but.... 
I am currently at this hotel now and leaving today so this will be a pretty fresh review. My main concerns with this hotel would be the actual room itself and the customer service comes as a close second. 
When I first got here, I went down to the very first floor and asked to employee if I could bring my car in... obviously meaning how do I park in the garage that's on the same floor. The smart ass goes ""well you can't just drive your car into the building so how do you suppose you do that?"" So obviously didn't start on a great note. There were other instances where the staff just wasn't very friendly. Just dry for the most part. 
As for the room, the only reason I have an issue is because I paid almost $600 dollars for my room. If it was just any other hotel for a cheaper rate, I wouldn't mind. But for $600 dollars my room was not worth it. It was like a simple room that didn't even come w a fridge or microwave. I've stayed in motels that included those things. As some of the other comments say, they also scam you w the pictures they provide online of their ""views"". I paid $600 for a harbor view and stayed on the 6th floor so I actually saw a street full of bars and loud people THEN a small harbor of water in the distance. Since I was right above a street of bars, I heard music and screaming all night so that's another thing to add. If you do stay here, make sure you request the highest floor and just know your view won't be as advertised. I had even called and spoke to a representative and MADE SURE of the view and she repeated up and down that it would be the harbor view. Technically, you do see the harbor. Again, in the distance. They just are not very truthful/transparent about what you're getting here. On top of that, breakfast was not free considering paying $600 for TWO nights. One good thing is they do let you ride bikes for free and I wanna say they offer another activity for free but not too sure. The room was also clean so no complaints in that aspect. Just a bit small for the price. 
Maybe I'm just expecting too much from the Hilton or maybe the Hilton is a little too overhyped. Idk. But definitely did not receive the service I had expected. I definitely will be staying somewhere else next time that's probably gonna be a lot cheaper for the same room. Would not recommend this place. Not worth the price.",2020-10-04 13:15:56

I ordered the salad with the roasted beets, goat cheese, and almonds. Boyfriend had no idea what to order (he's not an adventurous eater and if it isn't a burger, he doesn't know what it is!) so I ordered him the chicken shawarma based on reviews here. We also got the hummus with falafel to share.

So! We started out with drinks- boyfriend asked for water and we both got tap water with no ice (apparently they had no ice). He wasn't too happy with it but I didn't mind much- I understand it's very casual and not really a restaurant-restaurant. 
But when we got our pita with hummus and falafel... MAN it was good. For me, I'm not usually a huge falafel fan, but this was done perfectly! It was extremely good, and very filling.

Then came dinner. I'm a vegetarian so I didn't try Boyfriend's shawarma, but he said it was good and devoured the whole thing. My salad was big and actually pretty filling (or maybe that was the hummus appetizer) and well balanced. I don't usually like any kind of beets but it was very good, very well balanced.

I would have loved to try something from the little bakery shelf they had but both of us were WAY too full to even think about food! We even ended up taking the rest of the hummus and pita and falafel home. I am very happy with this place.

The employees are really nice, really enthusiastic, and make the whole experience way better. The food was good with different options,which I like, and extremely filling which counts for a lot in my book! There are so many places where you might go and drop a lot of money and not even go home stuffed... This is NOT one of them! I love it!

Now for what might turn you off: My boyfriend was a little upset that they gave us one fork for the hummus platter, and then they didn't bring out another for my salad but I don't mind because I just used that fork :P He also didn't like the plastic dinnerware, but you gotta keep in mind it's a very casual place. So it's not a fancy date night place but it is good for one of those intimate nights where you want something good, filling, and different.

Also, I would prefer to give a 4.5 star rating but there is no option. This would be 5 stars from anyone else, but I reserve five stars for those seriously seriously no-flaws-plus-more-great-things-than-usual places.",2012-10-25 15:56:29

I was excited to stay here based on some of the reviews and pictures I saw but there were a LOT of issues with our stay. Based on what we experienced here, I will not be staying again and I will not recommend it to anyone else. 

Location-It's not quite as close to bourbon st or anywhere interesting as they claim. It's a fairly decent walk to anything worth going to, so that is issue 1.

Entrance- no drive or proper loading and unloading area. You just pull up and hope the valet has actually moved the cars so there is space for you. You're just unloading in the middle of a busy street  
 
The Valet- was an absolute prick. The guy we were greeted by the evening we arrived, around 7:00pm Saturday December 10th was very kind. He helped us load our things and retrieved a luggage trolley for us. We asked him to hold the car there for a few minutes because we may drive to dinner and he was kind enough to do so. 

The man that retrieved our car, the morning of Sunday the 11th at about 8:45am was absolutely horrible (older black man, I think glasses, had a beanie on). He was not only rude but totally incompetent. But his attitude made the situation completely ridiculous. 
We came out with a trolley laden with road trip fodder and he saw me waving to him as he sat in the street. He originally had pulled up closer to the door but then once he saw me waving, he decided  that he would not park the car in the available space by the door, but rather back up way down the street & he left it in the middle of the street lane!!! I said ""excuse me, I have that whole trolley to unload, and I would prefer to not drag it down the entire street."" He said in a really rude tone ""there is no where to park it"". And yes--there was. As I was pointing to the huge space available in front of the door, a large sedan pulls up and parks. And I said ""see, there was a space.  Now it's taken. You were right next to it"". At this point, instead of apologizing or I dunno, moving some of the other cars (because you're a valet and this is a loading zone only), he flings my keys at me, doesn't lift a finger to help load our luggage and stalks off inside. I had to repark the car myself because he left it wide open, in the middle of the driving lane and loading lane, not even kind of a decent park job. 
His attitude was completely gross, unprofessional and inappropriate. And if I felt like dedicating the time, I would have headed straight inside to demand that I speak with management and raise absolute hell!! As it is, we are on a road trip and it's more convenient to simply leave this review for every passing eye. We have places to be! Bye, Felicia! 

The room- 
negatives--
it really is small & I mean small. And I wouldn't have such an issue with that, if it were nicely appointed. I found the materials, especially the bed linens to be really cheap and very very uncomfortable. The blanket on the bed reminds me of a scratchy grey moving blanket and it sure felt like one too. It was thin, rough and small. The blanket beneath that was like the material of a cheap towel. It was crunchy and also scratchy. The sheets were fine enough. 

Directly over the bed, right in your face in our room (608), is an alarm or detector and flashes a light. Didn't notice it until all the lights were out but it is BRIGHT and it blinks every 20-30 seconds, constantly. If it were anywhere else in the room, it wouldn't matter. But it's right above your face and you can see the green light through your eyelids while you're trying to sleep. So that was fun. 

No windows at all. It's rather like staying on a cruise ship (except I went on a week cruise and my room had windows and was actually bigger by a lot). 
It's all interior walls so there is no windows, no view, no day light... kinda creepy and sad. 

The bed- it is very hard and unyielding. It was a little sponges at first but it maybe only gives about an inch. After that, it's an absolutely brick. But then the pillows are hallow and even when stacking two, you get zero neck support. 

Positives- the shower is really nice. It's big, it was very clean and it was nicely done. The hardware,  Grohe, is expensive and nice stuff. I was impressed to see that it was used here. Shows the hotel cares about some details but I would have rather seen that money put towards better linens and a better mattress/pillows.

Advice--
If you choose to stay here,  there is a garage that shares a wall and with the hotel. Park your own car. The cost of the valet at the hotel is 36 bucks one night, the parking garage costs the same if you're just parking over night and not coming and going. Then you don't have to deal with the horrible valet service and unloading in the street. 

Bring your own pillow. The bed would have been ok with a good pillow.",2016-12-11 15:47:45
JMEipFK1N0ZZ1YqJOZrfjQ,ieddiannWKFvVmBGS778Vw,NFzfuIFghE-HnrodHpaT6A,4.0,2,2,2,"Of course when this opened I knew we needed to go (being a big Garces fan and all). What I didn't do was look at any reviews first and I'm glad I didn't since it allowed me to experience the place fresh with no expectations. Of course that meant I didn't know it was a BYOB. No worries said the hostess, we have a wine store here.. Huh? I'd never seen that before! Sure enough, there was a nice, full wine selection in a walk in wine fridge. After picking out a few bottles I went to pay and found that it was indeed a PLCB wine store (with state employees and all).. inside the restaurant! Brilliant! Why hasn't anyone thought of this before??

We had some time to wait so the hostess popped open our bottle, poured us our glasses and we wandered around some more. On the other side (across from the wine store) is a really nice (fairly priced) mini market with cheese and meat counter along with bread and desert sections.

While waiting we tried out a bunch of olive oils (white truffle oil was my favorite) and some sample meats and cheeses. One of the meats was something I'd never seen before. It was listed as $55 a 1/2 pound and called jamon iberico. From reading the card, it seemed to be that this was a type of Spanish prosciutto. But $110 a pound? Come on! How good can it have been? Sure enough the meat guy pulled it out and started slicing some for a dinner appetizer and I asked him : ""$110 a pound? Come on! How good can it be??"" and he sliced off some for me and handed it over. It was well worth every penny. I couldn't believe how perfect it was.

It was Saturday so we had to wait a while and we had already finished one of our bottles and I was a bit buzzed by the time we sat down so I wasn't my usual foodie self when ordering. First up? Appitizer version of the jamon iberico (awesome). Second course was a vichyssoise which was quite good. Final course was a special Frites and steak thing that wasn't too bad (but wasn't amazing). 

Sadly I was too drunk to pay attention to what my girlfriend was having but she seemed pleased. Being a vegetarian its sometimes hard for her to find something amazing but she was pretty happy. 

Anyway, final word was that this place was fun and tasty and I plan on going back again. And again.",2010-06-03 12:39:27

xH0itlHXoHMfI1EO3RqLuQ,A9cXP_K95FRor1qxuUEu2g,0QSxyOzXwDdaSbeK7p3GYw,4.0,1,2,1,"After having a couple of friends give some major kudos to this somewhat divey restaurant and bar on the corner of 56th & Keystone near Glendale, I decided that a long work week deserved a little bit of a reward and so I stopped in for dinner during the early evening hours on a Friday night. 

Keystone Sports Review opened its doors in 1990 and has become fairly known in the area for its tenderloins, pizza, made-to-order steaks, and old-fashioned neighborhood feeling. The restaurant may have the good fortune, or bad fortune depending upon your viewpoint, of being right across from a proposed Meijer taking a good portion of the strip just south of 56th on Keystone. Regardless, it's in a small free-standing building that looks a lot smaller on the outside than it is on the inside. The parking area is kind of tight. It looked like there was one identified accessible spot, definitely not ADA compliant, along with one curb cut onto their sidewalk, also not ADA compliant but fairly workable. 

As you go in the door, there's a dining area immediately to your left with a few retro-looking booths and a few tables. It's a tight squeeze for wheelchairs, but there's a couple tables that work fairly easily. Just beyond that is the bar area with the kitchen area to the left. I will admit that as I went in and got to a table that I started to get pretty unimpressed. I sat at a table for several minutes without an acknowledgement of any type. I found myself wondering ""Do I have to go to that counter over there?"" ""Is it like Pizza King where I have to snag down some train to order?"" 

I couldn't figure it out. 

Eventually, it became apparent that a shift change was going on. The soon to be leaving server came over and took my drink order, the usual unsweetened iced tea, and gave me a menu that consists of their specialties along with a variety of meals and sandwiches. I hadn't had a burger in quite a while, so I opted to try their sirloin burger with American cheese and a side of fries - all sandwiches come with chips, but you can upgrade to fries for $1, waffle fries for $1.50 (I believe), and onion rings for $2.50. My entire meal came in at $9.80 - a definite value. 

About this time, the first server left and was replaced by someone clearly of fresh spirit and energy. While I was leaning toward a 3-star at this point, between the new server and the solid food the rating started moving upward again. 

The burger was very good - prepared as ordered (medium well) and definitely was worth the decision to split from my usual dietary regimen for a meal since i hadn't eaten all day. The fries were lightly seasoned - not necessarily that unique, but they were tasty and the order was a nice size. I did get my always desired iced tea refill. 

To offer a wee bit of a disclaimer, I'll acknowledge that about 2/3 of the way through my meal that I have a cousin who works here. I had no idea, but he works delivery a couple nights a week. So, we sat and chatted for a bit. That was a pleasant surprise. 

The atmosphere is definitely a touch divey, but not uncomfortable or dirty. It's a good old-fashioned restaurant and bar that almost made me want to look around for Alice, Flo (""Kiss my grits!""), or Vera. 

They weren't there. 

Once service got going, it was much more attentive and I'll still confess a fondness for servers who use those cliche'd terms of affection like ""sweetie,"" ""baby,"" or whatever...Yeah, I was happy. When you get my age, that's about as close as it gets to affection. 

They have 8 HD Televisions and show sports quite often, that should be obvious, and they also have a digital jukebox. 

They have pizzas that do come in an individual size and I look forward to trying one in the future. 

I was able to relax, read a magazine, listen to some music, and just do some fun people watching. It was a fun time, a good meal, a very good price, and I'll definitely be back in the near future. While I'd ordinarily dock another star considering the accessibility concerns and the initial service issues, Keystone Sports Review came in at the end and won me over.",2015-06-13 01:30:06
fVCVWLSYMAEX7Xv7WKbBKQ,pTGOYPbTtPJ_qlDvP3pxfw,6djwQL1FOoe0SZONQHjhrw,5.0,11,0,6,"How did Chandler's do with a first timer such as myself? Let me tell you what makes this place so special is the EXPERIENCE, even on a Sunday night they didn't cut any of it short. It's no secret I am one of Yelp's toughest critics, because it's hard to hide mistakes from someone who knows how to cook fine dining.  My official score is 4.5 yet I am swayed by the exceptional service to push it to 5.  

*Pre Dining-  Chandler's phone service was the very appetizer to what I would soon experience. I called a few times just to get information, each time the lady was friendly and so knowledgeable.  She had no problems telling me menu items, specials, and suggesting we set a reservation (I'm glad we did) 

*Atmosphere- We both enjoyed the live jazz music that added to the ambience of an already classy place.  The lighting is dim and each table flickers with a oil lamp to give that extra intimate feel. Everything is done so you FEEL like you want to spend money ... and then you do lol The lighting is not the best for pictures as you will notice, but hey not taking a selfie for a few hours won't kill you or will it? 

*Service- My favorite thing even over the food was our server Lucas and how personable he was.  He was full of information and answered all of our questions, it really felt like we were at a friends house for dinner. He took extra time with the menu explaining items and finding out about us.  Every step of the way he was there throughout the meal, also our drink was always filled which we appreciate.  

*Food- Since it was our first time we wanted to ease in and went for the Sunday night special $30 for 3 courses.  (Amazing deal for the experience).  

App- Lobster Bisque/ creamy, well seasoned, tender chunks of lobster with a nice bread for dipping. 

Entrée- Duck two ways/ My friend enjoyed this it was cooked perfectly, the duck confít tasted similar to dark meat turkey.  He didn't care for the polenta just a preference of taste and texture.  Mac n cheese was not my favorite, seemed it was over powered by herbs and a tangy mustard like flavor. 

Entree- Lamb/ My lamb was nice thick chops oven roasted to perfection (medium rare) It was very well seasoned just a tad to much salt from the rub but the apple mint chutney mellowed it out.  My baby carrots were sautéed so they had a bit of bite, the weakest element was the potatoes au gratin very bland and needed help. 

Dessert- Lucas was able to get us the chocolate soufflé  as it is kinda famous...WE HAD TO TRY IT!  It did not dissapoint either in SIZE of flavor. It is accompanied with a whipped cream w a hint of orange and a chocolate ganache (sauce) you pour over and it is heaven. Well worth the money and a perfect ending to a great experience.  

  Thanks Lucas! You are a Rockstar and I would come back and expect the same service from any other one of Chandler's servers.",2015-10-26 02:51:19
E_8GJWtSczmVPWSVhyrUgQ,M1fk_IYOyZBKIw6ov8Q9hg,0wQCEcpZ57TmTm6EmEDsIw,3.0,2,0,0,"Pretty good BBQ place.  I certainly enjoyed the outdoor patio, especially that it faces east and is shaded for dinner.  Service left something to be desired, though.  Our server was very nice.  However, our appetizer wasn't put in for the kitchen - so the food came out first.  The server apologized and said he had totally forgotten to enter it.  We got it shortly afterward, and it was at no charge.  We also waited quite a bit before we initially saw the server, and checking on us was kind of sketchy.  I think part of the problem was that there didn't seem to be anyone dedicated to the patio diners.  Each table had a different server that was also working the inside tables.  Granted, it wasn't crowded outside at the time (about 4 or 5 tables), but still...rearrange your work flow.

The food was generally good, so I'm going with a solid 3 star rating.  It wasn't knock your socks off better than other BBQ places, but I'd recommend it to others.

Hush puppies, while they came late as appetizers, were good and dense & hot.  Dipping sauce was homemade - basically mayo with some spices added, but needed a little bit of zing or heat.

The St Louis ribs were yummy.  Quite tender, almost falling off the bone - but still had enough chew and stick to the bone that they weren't mushy.  Didn't seem to have been pre-boiled.  I liked the light smoky flavor throughout the meat, and the slightly charred sauce covering them.

Pulled pork had a good flavor, but was just a bit dry.  Brisket was tender, with enough fat to give it flavor.

The sides:  Greens with bacon was excellent - full leaf greens was a pleasant surprise, with just enough vinegar for a little tartness, and the big smoky bacon chunks were generous throughout.  Baked/BBQ beans were also well prepared, if typical.  Sweet potato casserole, with pecans and crunchy topping was marvelous - almost could have been dessert.

Speaking of dessert...seems like every BBQ place now has homemade desserts - which I like.  Hendrick's was out of half of their choices, unfortunately the more desirable ones, but better to only have it fresh I guess.  So we got a blueberry cobbler.  This was disappointing.  The blueberries seemed to have come directly from a can (little and dark, rather than the larger and less dark purple that comes fresh), and the topping was thick & dense.  While the single size skillet it came in was very hot, there were still cool spots in the blueberries, and the topping was cooked but could have used a couple more minutes.  I guess they make up a supply and keep them in the fridge.  Either the oven was set too high for even heating throughout, or the cobbler just wasn't left in quite long enough.",2014-08-07 14:18:43
CvNZAMMi0XR-PhQ3WmglBQ,alD93dybuSgsId5mBwSaXQ,vzg7aAK2Rv8dcNsRhYUaMQ,4.0,3,0,0,"I was having my first child, and like any over-joyed parent, I was preparing myself and seeking a pediatrician; researching High and Low,  I was between two practices [one very conventional, old school] before finally settling on Hales Pediatrics [non-conventional, new-age; see below for examples].  

So many reviews wrote how elitist this practice was.  I'm so glad I'm a person who forms their own opinion based on personal experience.  If you have any doubts, schedule a visit, and go see for yourself.  That's what I did; at my tour I received some literature which contained bios on each of the physicians in the practice, the packet of forms and a book for new moms on how to prepare for baby.  Of those physicians, I personally opted to see Dr. Milvid.  Although their were occasions when she wasn't available I saw others.  Dr. Gorman is very good and friendly as well, she was the attending pediatrician at the hospital for my second child.     

The only negative, and I don't know if its any different now, but when I was having my son, the physicians of this practice did not perform circumcisions, it worked out for me that the other practice I was looking at did.  So the other practice performed it, but ultimately I ended up bringing my son to Hales for his first doctor's appointment.  

If you are wondering what the deciding factor was for me in choosing Hales over the other practice, it was Office Administration.  I didn't like how the administration handled my queries; they were attitudish, rude, impolite and crass.  The doctor on the other hand was not, but before I get in to see the doctor I have to call the office, and that was just not something I was willing or able to do.  

The staff of ladies at Hales, have always been pleasant and courteous.  However, there was/is one that I feel has personal feelings and seems to be prejudice, but she stands alone in that department.  I have never felt it from any other member of the team.  I can't completely say that this practice is all about the health of the child; it is a business, a medical one at that.  They are in the business of making money, and you are flipping the bill so remember to utilize all the services they provide, if you need them.  There were times my child(ren) were not feeling well, I didn't know what to do, I called the emergency line, the messaging center notifies the doctors, and the doctors call you back.   Sometimes it can be up to an hour, but I have always received a callback.  They are affiliated with Children's Hospital, so they will refer you to After-Hours Care in Metairie or the ER.  

Hopefully you will have a great an experience as we have. 

Just a Note* 
Non-conventional, New-age:  child sits on parents lap during visits, combo vaccines, child does not remove all clothes, and all medical questions and test results will be told to you by physician.",2015-07-23 05:25:09

(THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON BEER OUTING ONLY)
What I got from it: When I saw that this place was the site for the conversations between Jefferson, Franklin, and others who would stay up late discussing and debating the future of our nation, I HAD TO COME HERE.  I dropped my plans to go visit a nationally famous beer location called Monk's Cafe, and I made sure that my evening plans were going to be spending time at the Tavern, in honor of history.

So yea, expectations were high.  Then I saw the plaque that basically said I was entering a reconstructed version of the Tavern that originally stood in the same place, but had been torn down a long while back, only to be resurrected by the city itself in honor of its history.

Hm.  I went in anyways.  What I got excited about was to have some ales that were done according to the recipes that Franklin, Washington, and Jefferson used to make their own homebrews.  These were produced by the famous Yards Brewery that has obviously been trying to get Philly to love it as its only brew of choice.  I saw them advertised even in tourist shops.  Needless to say, I still gave the ales a shot, and so very glad I did.

Beer doesn't have to be pigeonholed to be only interesting and hoppy.  It should be, at minimal, good to style.  Whether you personally love it or not needs to be placed in that seperate context.  I had the Jefferson Tavern Ale which was an English Strong Ale style.  It had a subtle malt smell, was crisp and malty with an light aromatic aftertaste.  So very well done to style!  So, don't feel like you're dragging your values down.  Order one of the ""historic ales,"" and try to order one of the styles you will like, realizing they will not taste like our  current trendy beers do. 

The bar area is small.  It's done simply with wood benches and small chairs.  Nothing interesting.  But then again maybe that's how it was back in the day?  The dinning room areas are where the action is, and I can believe that the men would have a good eat and drink while they were conversing.  My friend told me that a guy was playing the harp downstairs, and soon enough my friends and I found ourselves sitting in awe of the angelic music the harpist made while we nursed our ales.  

We had a pretty fantastic experience.  We'll be back, if only to have more harp encounters.",2014-09-01 14:43:11

Pete Kielburger was service advisor I was assigned to although I requested any other service advisor (for reason detailed later).  Pete only had A-service and Inspection scheduled.  Despite my knowledge that A-service and Inspection having a multitude of overlapping tasks involved, Pete explained to me that the A-service is ""like a seven page checklist"", and essentially dismissed my inquiry.  Not willing to waste time debating minimal dollars, I agreed to pay for both and requested the detailing, which I scheduled the week prior, be done.  I asked Pete if he inspected the car for any damage; he had not.  We inspected the car together and found one small scratch on left rear wheel.

Pete called 12:20 4/18 to inform that car wouldn't be complete until 4/19 because he had to order new brake pads, and wouldn't be detailed til 4/19.  This is the second time in less than year this replacement has been done in less than a year.  Be aware that Pete told me at intake that cars with low mileage get brake squeaking because the brakes get ""rusty"".  I reminded him that this had been an issue since delivery; no response.

Pete called @ 1:54 4/19 to inform car was ready for pick up.  I arrived @3pm, paid for services; told by cashier that key fob was in the car.  No key fob in car; took three people to locate.  I noticed on my way home that there were 25+ miles added to the odometer since drop off.

Inspected car upon arriving home.  Two white paint chips on hood of black car that were not there prior to service @ Keenan Mercedes.  Called Pete Kielburger who told me that car was dirty upon arrival, so he wouldn't have seen paint chips (i.e. damage was present at drop off).  The hood of the black car was clean at drop off; there was  everyday dirt on side panels behind wheels only.  Pete stated I should bring car back so he could ""make a determination"".  I asked what could be done to correct, and Pete stated ""paint chips could be touched up but won't be perfect"".  This is an S550 (not cheap) meticulously cared for, garage kept, one year old car, with 2850 miles. 

I emailed the Service Manager, Tom Haig, @ 4:42 on 4/19 explaining the situation and requesting a meeting with both him and owner, Jim Peruto.

I'd had previous interaction with Tom in August 2017 when same car mysteriously had $1600+ body damage.  Pete said he hadn't checked the car for damage at drop off; couldn't explain it.  I am convinced the car was sold damaged.  I reluctantly paid for repairs.  The car was returned with with misaligned front bumper.  I had to return it again...Fool me once.

I checked the service invoice, which noted that the detailing was a ""sublet"".  Perhaps this explains the mileage put on the car...  Where was the car taken, and who was driving it?  Why does Keenan Mercedes advertise ""detailing service"" on their website, if vehicle is sent to a separate company, without the owner's knowledge or consent?  Glanzmann?

Tom Haig replied to my email on 4/20 stating that he would inspect car, but ""seriously doubted if Jim Peruto will be available"".  Tom stated that he would take pics and share them with Mr. Peruto and ""General Manager"" (as yet unnamed), who would make ""ultimate decision on how this situation will be resolved"".  Tom copied Kevin Post @ Keenan Motors and Bob Glanzmann @ Keenan Mercedes on this email.  Tom requested that I forward pics to 215-515-8151, a number that is ""directly connected to service communication platform"".  Tom promised to confirm receipt of pics.

I forwarded pics to 215-515-8151 @ 2:38 on 4/21.  Included in that email, I reiterated my request to speak with GM and owner.  No confirmation of receipt of pics.  No communication at all.

I called Tom Haig @ 1:45 (in meeting, left voicemail to return call to discuss) and 6:10 (gone for day) on 4/23.  Crickets.

I've never received customer satisfaction survey from Mercedes for either service visit.

FYI:  I've purchased, in cash, two new vehicles from this dealership, a S550 and  a GLK 350 in the span of two years.

I would suggest avoiding Keenan Mercedes, sales and service, AT ALL COSTS.",2018-04-23 23:30:31
ovt6LvQRPUJaEsexxoCgIw,jmz8U7RwUYoo81l-vOjXfQ,BN3LFoIi1AFQ4IZhvrMXsw,2.0,8,4,2,"Ahh so long I've wanted to talk about the irony of this place. The truth is, I could give it more stars, but the areas that it is lacking in needs such improvement that I want these two stars to stand out. In fact, it's such a great offense, I should only give them one star.

The truth is, this is probably the best cafe in Tucson to hang out at. It is large with high ceilings and comfortable seating - something that is for some reason lacking in most cafes. The music is generally good and ranges all styles. It has a nice corner location with windows in the front. All in all the ambience is comfortable and you don't ever feel rushed to leave.

It's too bad this place is a cafe, though. Their coffee is abysmal. Maybe at some point in the past they received complaints from people who don't really like coffee, that their coffee is too strong. It tastes like hot water. This is true of their medium and dark roast. They have no business making such weak coffee. Their espresso is a little bit better; in the past it had an amazing earthiness to it, almost like Turkish coffee. Today they still serve an espresso that qualifies to be called such, but I expect better. Anyways, with a decent automatic espresso machine it really isn't that hard to succeed in this area.

Now the cafe as a bakery: you walk in and you cannot help but see the beautifully tall cakes at the front. They look so good. Yes, they do look good. And that's about it. They're expensive and taste like something a child put together. This is harsh, but they just have don't have the mature richness that someone over the age of fifteen would appreciate. The exception would be anything made with just chocolate, since chocolate is so amazing how can you screw it up? Yet a memory keeps trying to insist that the chocolate cake was maybe a bit dry... too bad I am not willing to risk the six dollars a piece to verify this.

The rest of their food is pretty much hippie/vegan/celiac fare. Honestly, I hate this crap. I understand that they probably get a lot of customers who prefer this, but it's crap. Have I tried it? No, not theirs specifically. I'm just complaining that they make so much of it. The savory food always looks old, yet somehow inviting. Weird.

Then there's the bathroom. Wtf. This place has some audacity making customers use that nasty key to get in there. Knowing that many people neglect to wash their hands, how does one go about staying hygenic? That is, when you can wash your hands here. For some reason, there is an automatic paper towel dispenser, but usually they have nothing but diluted dishwashing soap in an old plastic water bottle or no soap at all. They must know how crazy this is.

All in all, this place is just outright confusing. I've debated buying my own goodies and coffee from somewhere else, then coming here to buy maybe... something that I can give to my dog later on, and just relaxing on a comfortable old couch. Yes, that's what this place is good for.",2011-10-15 20:03:01
NripRT79e6O_en469VBbBg,Cg6JPa-KsHUgDiU1t-W9VA,NSsXMFzmmpiF9V5Nqcmvdw,4.0,6,3,4,"Whenever I hear all you can eat lobster I become very suspicious.  Especially when it's in a land locked state off of a freeway outside of Reno.  When I read the Yelp reviews I was intrigued. While most of them weren't great reviews they seemed to be a little knit-picky to me.  I decided to take a shot and go with my wife  and 2 year old.  

My first time to Boomtown and I was pretty impressed. It all looked updated and renovated.  After applying for a Boomtown players card and getting $4 off the buffet price and $5 worth of free play (nothing wrong with that).  We headed over to the Buffett.  It runs from about 2:00p to 9:00p and I think we showed up about 7:00p.  Not a long line but there was a family of about 14 that seemed to be having a difficult time getting through the cashier for whatever reason.  Big Hispanic family and very amusing.  While it slowed everything up it was worth watching the dad or uncle just frothing at the mouth to get to the lobster. That wasn't going to happen until they straightened everything out. This was like a $400 transaction.  This dude was jumping up and down and doing laps around one of the Buffett stations.  Once they gave them a table he bolted for the lobster (as I would have if having to wait that long). So the show worth the wait. 

When we got up to the cashier they could have charged something for my 2 year old but they didn't.  I thought that was pretty cool.   

The runners at the Buffett work their asses off so be generous when rtpping before you leave.  Our waitress (runner) was very helpful and very attentive even though she was handling a lot of tables. 

There is a lot to the Buffett besides the lobster but I was not going to be distracted. I headed straight back to the lobster station where a women was dolling out one lobster at a time.  That being said.... These were good size lobsters and besides that there was a serving tray full of  claws that you can take as many as you like.  

I believe the Buffett is about $25 with the players club discount. I may be off a little. 

I'm from NY, I've spent a lot of time in New England, I love lobster and my 4 favorite words are ""all you can eat"".  When I got back to the table my wife went up to the buffet for herself and to get my son something he would like.  I loved the fact that there was a big bucket on the table for the shells and whatever else of the lobster you couldn't  be bothered with.  

I was impressed with both the size and the taste of the lobster.  Grading on a curve it was a 9.  I ripped off the tails and cracked open the claws and ate a little of the leg meat on the 1st one. Dipped in clarified butter it was very tasty. 

My wife came back with a bowl of clam chowder and other ""non-lobster foods"".  I was stunned. I asked her why she didn't get lobster.  Her answer ""I'm saving it for last"" my question ""how many lobster(s) do you plan on eating""? Her answer ""one"". My response ""what?!?"" Her response ""I really don't like lobster"" my response ""that would have been good to know an hour ago"" and ""that is unacceptable"". She said she didn't like having to open them up.  I told her I would assist her. So I spent the next hour ripping shells off tails and claws.  All in all I went though about 5 lobsters and she probably ate 3.  I felt that represented a success.  That being Said she won't be accompanying me on my next lobster fest.  

My only real question is where are they getting the volume of these lobsters? My only explanation is that the mountains surrounding the hotel are filled with refrigerators stocked with lobsters.  (Inside joke for my wife).  

If you like lobster and can eat a couple of them it's worth the price and the rigamarole. If not, it's probably not worth it for you.  

I also had a blast attacking my son with a lobster head and him thinking it was the funniest thing in the world.",2014-09-02 21:17:18

My wife went to Auffenberg Hyundai to purchase a 2022 Tucson. (Specifically Limited Hybrid version) I was TDY at the time for the Air Force. With scarcity of new cars, she had to act immediately before it was snatched up. Unfortunately, my wife trusted the salesman (private message me if you want to know who it was) to treat her right and give her accurate information. First problem: It wasn't a hybrid. It was a normal Limited. The salesman was in such a hurry to make a sale, he never went over the fact it wasn't a hybrid. Second problem: When my wife asked if it was AWD, he said it was only FWD. She inquired that she thought the limited hybrid only came in AWD. He responded that the Midwest version only comes in the FWD and it would be a special order for AWD. He even said that AWD in this model is only good up till 8 mph and after that really wasn't worthwhile. AWD is only good on slow ice and snow. (Huh??) Straight out lied about AWD. Instead of going over different models with AWD, he plowed ahead trying to sell this specific car. Our bad for not reading the owners manual of the vehicle and knowing the vehicle better than the salesman. Worse Problem: Lied about financing. We can qualify for any financing, but knew Hyundai was offering a $500 incentive to go through their financing. My wife specifically asked how much additional it would cost for HMF financing. He said that it would only cost an additional $62. She confirmed/asked multiple times. He even said we couldn't pay it off until we paid 3 months worth of payments. (Huh??) She figured only $62 for financing over 3 months was great, so went ahead and bought the car for $36,995. ($39,381 w/everything) Once she brought it home, she was able to contact me (I was in the field all day) and had her take a picture of the car. Definitely not a hybrid. (No hybrid badge) I also calculated the financing. $451 over three months. (Almost the same amount we were supposed to save) I called Hyundai financing and they said we could definitely pay off immediately and there is no such thing as having to pay 3 months worth of payments. Called the manager at Auffenberg and told him of the horrible experience she had buying the car. The only thing he could offer is if he found a hybrid car in the next 72 hours, we could trade that in and pay the difference. I knew they would have no incentive to find a vehicle. Surprise--they didn't find one. We called other Hyundai dealers in St Louis and they said they would never trade a car with Auffenberg. The other option was to have his appraiser look at the car and give us an offer. 20 additional miles, we brought it in and they offered us....$33,000. CARMAX offered us $38,000 for the car a day later. My wife could see the manager and salesperson hiding in their office. Wouldn't even come out to talk to her. We talked to another Hyundai dealer in St Louis (he wanted to speak on condition of anonymity) and he couldn't believe what information he told my wife, why he didn't educate her on all the different models, confirm if that was really the vehicle she wanted, and lied about financing. He was amazed the salesperson would do that in today's market since new cars sell themselves. He said if one person doesn't buy it, there are twenty people behind them that will buy it. I'm so disappointed in how a dealer and salesman can take advantage of someone because they don't know the cars better than they do. If I knew what I know now, I wouldn't have ever gone to Auffenberg. We still absolutely love our new Tucson Limited. I know new cars are incredibly hard to find now, but you have to ask yourself, ""How much is that car really worth, is it really worth going to a certain dealer or should I just wait until another dealer I want to go to has the car I want?"" Please learn from my mistake. Choose wisely.",2021-10-23 19:33:39

At the end of March 2017, my 2009 Toyota Matrix visited this dealership for two recalls...I spoke with Parts and was told that all the parts for the most recent two recalls were available for my vehicle and I could now schedule service...  I scheduled service...My car was kept for an entire day. When I got home and looked at the invoice I then learned that only ONE of the TWO recalls was addressed (the deadly passenger airbag bomb was still in my car). 

I then received a customer satisfaction SURVEY by email and I rated the dealership low in terms of satisfying my service expectations. 

One of the recalls is the potentially deadly Takata passenger airbag recall that has so far killed 11 people in the USA and maimed others when the airbag igniter explodes like a bomb filling the front seats with deadly or debilitating shrapnel. https://youtu.be/skDuh7E_V1I

After the half-done recall service, I called and left a message to my assigned ""Service Advisor"" Thomas Carlisle to get the airbag recall addressed...

In response to my msg. to service advisor Thomas, Kurt Dohy the ""Guest Relations Manager"" called me to let me know that HE thought that my survey response was unfair since the car was returned on time (only half done 50% = F)... Dohy informed me that I should use Toyota of Ventura or Oxnard since I rated the Santa Barbara Parts and Service Departments so low in my survey.  

He let me know that since survey responses are scrutinized by ""management"" their Service Advisors would be ""too gun shy"" to risk a negative evaluation for the recall that remains undone.  

I emailed my dissatisfaction to ""General Manager"" Mike Caldwell... He reported that ""we take our surveys seriously so you should use another dealership"". 

I have now written complaints to Toyota-USA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (supervising the recall) and now Yelp. 

When the car was in for recall service the courtesy inspection revealed that my water pump was in need of replacement...I was quoted $550 to do the repair...DIY $50 for a Gates water pump (on Amazon) $15 for antifreeze and distilled water, and under an hour to flush the cooling system and install.  Youtube video showed me tips on how to getter dun.  

Do it yourself instead of overpaying this dealer and this dealer may tell you too to ""Go Fish!"" if you are not a highly profitable customer who says you are happy in their satisfaction survey.

Update: 4-20-2017: I just received a call from Toyota-USA and they report that they also spoke with Kurt Dohy the ""Guest Relations Manager"" who took the stand that  Toyota of Santa Barbara is a private business and reserves the right to refuse service to anyone, even for potentially life-threatening recall work.  The Toyota-USA Customer Service Rep reported that there was no more that they could do besides document each side's point of view in this matter.

I will next file complaints with the Better Busines Bureau and the State of California Bureau of Automotive Repairs.

Recommendations for Toyota service/repair?
I have always been preferring dealership servicing for my cars. During the years I drove VWs, this worked well. With my Prius, I was afraid to take it elsewhere. But after 6 long suffering years, now I have had it with Toyota of Santa Barbara.
Q. Any recommendations for a competent independent shop competent to maintain this computer-centric drive system?

There were 20 replies and here are the most descriptive.

Dan R. from San Roque · 14 Mar
When I bought my truck from the fleet manager at DCH in Oxnard, he said his entire morning was booked with appointments from Santa Barbara and the joke around the office was that Toyota of Santa Barbara was married to their cars since they were never able to sell one. My every experience with them, sales or service, has been unpleasant and unsatisfactory.

Elise and Jaime D. from San Roque Gardens · 14 Mar
I too have a Toyota and will not return to Toyota of SB service. I had a Nissan for years, loved SB Nissan's service folks, so returned to them when it became clear that Toyota's service was lousy. They've been great!

Brown B. from Upper East · 14 Mar

KO1GaOr_8pz9hdYPKqS6tQ,EDJTJsTfF2Nn2zWKrn2Otg,4gS2qtxNFpmpUE4dtzSXyA,1.0,3,0,0,"I've had Yelp since the very beginning & this is the first time I've ever left a review, so that should hold some weight. 

Lots of red flags from the get go. No one cares about you, employees stare at their phone, they make you wait HOURS to go over paperwork with financial team (probably to tire your mind so you don't notice all the extra hidden fees) PS: Don't ever let them renew your tags. It cost me $80 on my own --they charged me over $200 & OVER A MONTH LATER -- I still don't have my plate & am now driving around with expired tags due to their lack of delivery & promise. 

What sent me over the edge -- a sales associate offered to detail my car. Seems nice right? Wrong. When I was ready to leave, no one could find him / my keys / my car -- complete chaos. I had specifically said to this associate to do the ""inside only"" (as I just had body work done on the outside & my car can't go through a wash) WHAT DOES HE DO INSTEAD? Takes my car thru a wash & does NOT detail the inside. The exact opposite of the service promised & ruined my freshly done body work. When I called to talk to a manager about my experience  -- it only got worse.

The #1 reason I will warn people to stay away is the customer service (or lack there of) -- their GM Jason Polk was not friendly or solution orientated at all. Instead he kept calling me ""offended"" & told me he was too busy to listen to me on the last day of the month. Way to make a customer feel appreciated! He told me I WASN'T his customer & that his dealership just did me a favor by processing paperwork for purchasing my leased vehicle. He could care less about anyone that walks in the door -- so my advice to you is DON'T. 

Hey Nissian, when will I ever get my plate? I called again last week & your associate transferred me to voicemail after voicemail. Not solution orientated,  not friendly, doesn't answer emails or return calls, etc

EDIT: In regards to the below comment from dealership--I already emailed the GM Clint when Jason wasn't helpful at all. Clint never responded to me. It's been over a month. This business has yet to  be helpful.",2018-09-04 22:54:46
WHxgf6Jzorqw5FAv7icPgQ,jo2lNtPOvZAf3xiJS4h5OA,5quEJwHni6CuR-zh85hJ3Q,1.0,5,0,0,"I wish I had paid attention to all of these negative reviews before I brought my children to this dentist office. I am writing this review as a WARNING to other parents not to bring their children here. Dr. Solow seems like a knowledgeable enough dentist/orthodontist, but he moved forward on my child's orthodontic treatment without my consent while I was in the hallway getting a very confusing price estimate from his receptionist. This is a minor problem compared to the BULLYING, PHYSICALLY ABUSIVE behavior of his staff.

Two of Dr. Solow's hygienists mistreated my thirteen-year-old son in absolutely inexcusable ways. The first hygienist didn't communicate with him at all, and after fumbling with many failed attempts to put spacers between his teeth, she called for help from another hygienist  who was even more rude, unkind, and physically abusive. These two hygienists proceeded to gang up on him, talk about him as if he was not there, and  ignore him when he asked them to stop. My 15-year-old daughter had just had her teeth cleaned and was there to witness all of this. When she spoke up on behalf of her brother, asking them to listen to him while they had him pinned  down in the chair, she was told she had no right to tell them what to do. I can't believe I was on the other side of the door while all of this was happening. When I returned to the treatment area, I saw a look of rage in my son's eyes that I had never seen before. My daughter calmly explained to  me how the hygienists had mistreated her brother, while they both tried to cover it up saying they just wanted to ""get the torture over with."" Was this supposed to make me (or him) feel better?

When I got home, I called the office and talked directly with Dr. Solow. He apologized immediately and asked me to repeat what had happened so he could repeat it out loud so the people involved could hear what my complaint was. I'm a forgiving person and appreciate a genuine apology, but this seemed a bit contrived--or perhaps it's a common occurrence. He didn't seem shocked or appalled by what I said. 

I have taught my children to be respectful of all people. What we experienced at this dentist office was total disrespect. I'm so glad my daughter spoke up for her brother. But I feel terrible for entrusting my children to people who clearly don't understand the basic trust and respect that must exist between a healthcare provider and a patient. Just because they have murals on the walls and cartoons playing does not make them the ""child friendly"" practice as they claim to be.

In the future, I plan to bring my children to a very caring dentist  I recently saw in Havertown, Dr. Petras. I imagine she'll be great with people of all ages because she understands the importance of treating her patients with kindness, gentleness, and respect. And for my son's braces, I was happy to find Faust Orthodontics.",2015-02-17 01:12:21
SmAb2pq86eeVa_zv1DtuEA,ZkBEf-zySXAitlhkCt-vCg,3H3oPK49tN3gVd128yvwXw,4.0,0,0,0,"My week at Heaven Spa:
So for the past few weeks I have had some back fatigue so on the last day of my mini stay-cation I decided I was in need of a deep tissue.  I called on Monday Morning and was able to book an appointment for 2:30-Awesome!!!! One of the things I love about this place- I havent been turned away once- but again note I did call on a weekday- Anyway, I get there 15 min early just like I should and always do, and was greeted warmly and friendly by their front desk staff-I  dunno again like I have said before I have never experienced the rude staff or standoffish vibe that other people have gotten but again it is a weekday, not as busy and I dunno maybe they read out review on YELP guys..... So of course being skeptical and kind of expecting the worst-I was taken back for my deep tissue massage-again-wonderful! She didnt talk too much definitely checked in with me to see if the pressure was too hard or soft, but I started to notice that either her time management was off or she was rushing through the right side-  when she was all done she placed a soothing hot towel on my back and said I'm done  and left me to relax and get myself together.  Feeling that it was a little early I sat up took a look at the clock that was covered with a towel thoughtfully, (to avoid the brightness of the numbers in the room a nice touch I thought) and to my surprise she had only take ONE HOUR!!! This is a 90 min service, and financially so as well I paid 145 for this massage-  Wuickly I got dressed rushed myself out of there because after reading our reviews etc, I thought maybe it was like a scam or something and they were giving me a half our to lay there relax and then get changed.... So as you can see im like rushing out of there loosing my relaxed, zen like state of mind and annoyed
Side note: before getting dressed I came out of the massage room and my masseuse was wiating for me-I told her I think this is supposed to be 90 min, and of course not understanding my english she just nodded and motioned for me to go back into the room and I could lay down and relax...she even thought I was asking what to do for my next service where to go-no I dont have another service I am telling you I paid for  90 min...I even said those words paid for 90 min and she still didnt understand-----FRUSTRATING!!!!!! I'm sorry but that a huge peev about here!!! These ladies only really know how to say your name, if this hurts and are you ok?  Anything beyond that forget it.... 
I went to the front desk to explain what happened and the girls were great they gave me a 45.00 credit toward another service, adn thanks to you guys, I remembered to make sure I told them about it during my confirmation appointment.  So I made an appt for Saturday with my girl Biba who has the BEST facials and I stated ""She did an acne facial on me last time and I want to do the Same thing again with her.""  Well fast forward to Saturday, and with no problems I was able to use my credit,  no problems there, got my robe and key and proceeded to the lounge.
Now I'm sorry but maybe some of you can agree with me here-the lounge is an area for de-stressing, resting your eyes and just taking in the light refreshments, and spa music-I'm sorry but ever since the addition of the plasma tv in this room..... ugh it just has this coffee shop kind of feel now with the ladies waiting for services chatting amongst themselves and whatevers on the TV (muted of course)-I mean I've been to toppers, blue mercury and other places of that nature and NEVER would there be a TV with Ellen on in the lounge area-Nor would there be patron giggling about the music and obnoxiously chatting in such a relaxing environment, Anyway Im greaated so wonderfully by Biba and as usual the facial was A+++ I will only go to her- but in our discussion she asked why i hadn;t booked the acne facial again and when I said I had she apologized profusely for the mistake on the front desk's part, and assusred me my next facial would be the acne facial, with however much extra time needed to make sure all areas were cleaned out-My last facial with her (90 min) lasted about 2 hours with her just being so thorough and precise I love it!!
So the lesson learned:Services here are wonderful! When you find someone you like keep coming back to them it really is one of the better places in this area that isnt a nail salong/spa or hair dresser/spa-You really get a ""Toppers"" feel for the spa effect.
The lack of english speaking massage therapists is frustrating, but if you can get through with just being quiet and not have to ask any questions, your good.
Try and go on a weekday or not busy time!
The front desk just needs a little work in ""slowing down"" and taking their time in booking, and LISTENING to clients it sounds like. Within in one week my massage was cut short and the wrong facial booked on Two separate days I mean they are making it right and all, but the inconvenience does start to get wearing. Very $$$",2012-02-26 16:24:16
8YVBHMfngiRTERRRrv0zaQ,q32yhfDq2OYm61dIWRKF1w,OGPz7hxR8CP2UpooFc6PFw,2.0,1,4,2,"Went there to shop with my girlfriend and while she enjoyed herself looking at deals I was scanning the area and getting a feel for the area.
Upon walking yiu are greeted with a salty, buttery smell. I've always loved that as a kid and it's always a welcome memory. We were greeted instantly by half enthused cashiers. They did the bare minimum, pass.
Walking around I saw a worker with extremely dirty pants and a hole or two in his shirt who's stomach was hanging out and no belt leaving a crack as a declaration of tenure and apathy.
We found a wicker dear head that she wanted but we couldn't find the price. The only person I could find was the man with dirty pants. I asked if we could get the price he took his Barcode reader out without even acknowledging me and scanned it. His reply after scanning it was, ""I can't find it, let me go look."" He grabbed it from my hands and walked away with no direction. There was a nice gentleman who was being trained by Tenure Man who had an apologetic face and tone of voice. He was nice enough to keep us company while the price was searched for. It ended up being a party as other employees began to gather and help look for the price. Nice experience there. Roughly 7 minutes later Tenure Man came back but without the wicker deer head. He didn't miss a beat as he went back to his job and left his trainy behind and shouted they're coming to help you.
More waiting with the nice new guy.
5 minutes later a manager came out from the back and said we don't know. Let's match the price with the other one. 39.99. Someone said it's on sale and we should be able to get the price lowered to 20.
We went to purchase and asked if they price match they're online store. The best answer anyone could've ever got was, ""I don't know. How much was it?""
My girlfriend, ""An employee said she thinks it's 19.99""
Cashier then adjusts the price without delay...
Don't get me wrong, I'm not upset saving 20 bucks but, not even fact checking? Fine... 5 dollars online for a new tablet? I'm to honest for that...
We left and I was happier for it. 
2 stars because I feel this is an average experience these days. What a shame.",2015-10-20 19:09:41
dr6Rzkyg31KFRgic7g7vtQ,n-y4zlmQEk3ftj6GL-WZpQ,UjOq8dBVNv9weHrVDqm3kQ,4.0,4,0,0,"We had reserved one of the legendary  teeny tiny ""Classic Single"" rooms at the inflated holiday weekend rate of 250/night. At check-in, I remarked (very nicely) to the front desk person that I'd read a lot of reviews about how freakishly small those rooms were, and he gave me room 244, apparently the only classic single that has a full bathroom, closet, desk, dresser and flat screen TV. It was also on the second floor with nice windows and a bit of a view of the mountains. According to the front desk person and other hotel staff, 244 is the nicest ""classic single"" in the hotel, so if you're looking for a bargain (they charge the same rate for the smaller cramped rooms), ask for 244.

Friday evening of Memorial Day Weekend the hotel threw a holiday kick off party with free booze (but no soda for us non-alcoholic types, just water.. not even juice) and a nice assortment of cold cuts and cut fruit. Live swing band and chill Santa Barbara vibe. Overall, a nice surprise.

We tried out the jacuzzi that evening, it is open till 10pm and was totally empty on a Friday night, it was a little on the hot side but overall very fun, couldn't see a control to turn the temperature down or a timer mechanism for the jets.

Back in the room, the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very clean. The shower, however, was not quite working properly. When you switched the flow to the shower faucet, you still got a sizable flow from the bathtub faucet, which of course was scalding hot water. It was impossible to take a shower without burning the skin off your feet, so I only showered once, and my boyfriend had to use a bucket to gather the bathtub faucet water and then take a quick shower before it filled up.

At 5:00am, the bright sun shone right through the sheer orange curtains, which were essentially useless. Almost every hotel has blackout or heavy curtains to keep out the morning glare. The Oceana, which is right on the beach with little tree cover, really needs them, at least on the 2nd floor.

I arrived to grab a coffee from the breakfast room at 8:00am. The room opens at 7:00, so I figured it would be pretty empty, but oh boy I was wrong. It was packed to the gills with families and children. No coffee in sight and already out of quite a few items, like muffins and fruit salad. Eventually they brought in a new pot of coffee, but it took awhile. Also, the room is much too small for the amount of guests in the hotel, it was like bumper cars in there just trying to get a cup of coffee.

I was in the breakfast room about 4 times over the course of 2 days, and I never saw a free seat, it was always packed. Obviously they need more seating and more food/drink. Most guests were awkwardly carrying food to their rooms.

We ate at Sambo's, which is essentially on the property. Great pancakes and friendly service. Eat at the counter if you want to have a good time and get in and out of there quickly.

Overall the property was very quiet, considering how many families were staying there. I think the noise gets dissipated because the hotel is really a series of small buildings.

If location is important to you, this is a good hotel, but I would also look at other properties, I think you can get about the same or better for $250 in most of the hotels in the area. We chose this one because we decided to go to Santa Barbara at the last minute and this was the only hotel with any vacancies.",2011-05-31 03:34:48
F1J0RYtFCjOV4xvMZ-13aQ,UAriEeKHja74IMaUM-A5JA,MfLJGvIbk-dADJe934CIBA,1.0,0,0,0,"I hate going here. This store is down the street from my house so I have no other choice then to go to this store. I've had sprint my whole life and I swear when I get off this family plan, I'm switching companies.

I had a phone for 4 years without any problems, my dad picked it out. Then 2 years ago, I decided to enter the new world of smart phones. Personally, I don't know if its the store's or sprints fault but I've had a TON of problems. The first phone was having problems a couple months later so I took it in and asked if I could get it replaced/fixed. They told me they would reset it but they wouldn't replace it until I came in again with the same problem. So of course I came back a month later with the same problem. They told me the same thing and reset it. Okay, that was kind of annoying. Came in a third time with the same problem and finally they took it into the back and looked at it. An hour later, they told me that there was a problem with one of the parts (big surprise to me. not). So they would replace it free of charge. The only problem was that the phone was known for having problems and was no longer sold (again, big surprise).
After that phone, I got the same phone as the rest of my family. It was nice, worked well. In May of 2011 I started having problems. And at some point my phone just erased all of my texts and numbers. I took it in, they checked it out. They reset the phone and I continued my life. Then I had the same problem. They checked it out again and offered to replace it. So I did replace it with a different phone.
This phone was the worse phone I've ever had. When I was trying to figure out what phone to get, the guy told me that the cheapest phone was the best option. The other phone wasn't in stock and the other one was apparently difficult to work. I don't really know phones and was hoping that maybe if I listened to them then they would point me in the right direction. I am never trusting them again. This phone I had to take into the sprint store 3-5 times before they replaced it. There was an update on the phone that stopped me from being able to do anything so I went to 3 different stores asking what I needed to do to replace it. One store told me if I came back in September when my contact was up, then I could get another phone. So I come back to this store the first week of september, they tell my my contact isn't up and I needed to come back in a few more weeks. I did and that was the last time I was there.
After looking around for 20 minutes (they had apparently lost me in the store), an employee asks me what kind of phone I wanted to upgrade to. (And yes, I did make an appointment). I told him and then he said that they had just gotten the new iphone in the store. I was super excited for this. An iphone? Awesome. So I spend 30 minutes waiting for this guy to finish talking to his coworkers so he can install my phone. Only to take it home and find out that this wasn't the new iphone I thought it was. The new iphone was the 4S, this was only the 4. I wish he had told me and I would have waited for them to get the phone in stock. Like I've said before, I don't ever want to go back there again. Thankfully with the iphone, the apple store is the only place that can fix it.",2012-01-14 20:30:51
sK6zvygUYox9d5NPhUf63Q,Mzu4JHX8piVdzouf9bdQzQ,peXEcAZSMQZEdKJA5AgXXg,2.0,0,0,0,"Not sure what the hype is about.  Average at best, and expensive.  Three ""nothing special"" donuts ran a few nickels short of $6.

The Cinnamon Caramel Donut (a.k.a. ""crack donut"") - being the headline product of the establishment, had to give it a try.  As others have mentioned here, there doesn't seem to be much cinnamon, but there is an overwhelming amount of powdered sugar.  With most bites, I ended up with the inside of my mouth and tongue completely coated in powdered sugar; just dry, messy, and kinda gross.  Not much taste beyond powdered sugar; it was like eating plain tablespoons of the stuff.  It's messy - hard to eat it without getting powdered sugar everywhere. It's poured on so thick, when you tip the donut, it spills powdered sugar everywhere.  The donut under all the powdered sugar was unremarkable and average.  Only tasted cinnamon in one of the bites.

Plain Glazed - Very average.  Bigger than a Krispy Kream, smaller than many local donut shops.  Tasted like a day-old Krispy Kream.  Which isn't bad, but upon first bite, I thought it tasted like a not-quite-as-good (but close) Krispy Kream.  The glaze is the headline, and the actual donut was not memorable.

Peanut/caramel - If you like maple frosting, I don't think you'll find any here.  So I tried this one.  The caramel is too sweet for me.  If you like sweet, maybe you'll like it, but for a peanut donut, the sweet of the caramel was too powerful and the sugar rush hit me too hard to eat the rest of it.  The underlying donut was below average.

I *love* cinnamon rolls, but I can't stand cream cheese frosting.  As others have noted here, they aren't shy on high-stacking the frosting, so the cinnamon rolls are a no-go for me.  The rolls (not counting the frosting) seem very small anyway. Another Yelp review here noted that the cream cheese taste is strong - not hard to believe looking at the frosting.

There is a small selection of bread loaves (meh), and a ton of different kinds of jam/jelly (not my thing).

Since the Broad Ripple Pie Company went out of business a long time ago, have been unsuccessful in finding anything close to their apple pie.  Was hopeful that maybe this place would be the answer.  No dice. The pies seemed to be at an okay price point, but they looked unappetizing and ""thin"" (meaning the diameter of the pie was acceptable if not slightly small, but the height seemed really small/short).  If you've had/seen apple pie from Kroger - they looked like that (that's not good).  Places like Fresh Market have much better looking pies.

At the risk of 1st world problem griping, if you're going to pay just short of $6 for three donuts, it was a little odd that the employee who bagged them just tossed them into a small bag, resulting in the toppings from each donut getting smeared all over the other donuts and the inside of the bag.  There is another Yelp review here that stated the same thing, so I guess this is just what they do.

Service wasn't friendly, but it wasn't rude or off-putting in any way - so all that was fine. 

I asked if they had any cake donuts, and the answer was ""we don't make cake donuts"".  Since those are my favorite kind, that was kind of a bummer.  The donuts they did have (the actual donut, not the frosting/toppings) was average at best, and their toppings/glaze/frostings are too sugary for me.

Prices for the donuts were way above what you'd pay for much better product in many other places (this includes grocery stores).  

For the reader's context, I think Tim's in McCordsville is the best ever - way better donuts at a fraction of the price - there's a reason you need to place your order there the day before because the lines are usually out the door at that establishment (and for good reason).

Really wanted to love this place, and maybe many people will, but visit #1 gave me reasons not to come back (donuts not great / very sugary / expensive / somewhat limited selection) and no real reason to come in again (no cake donuts, pies didn't look good).",2020-01-17 20:08:23

Living in the Bay Area, there are so many nail salons, which makes it difficult to find a reputable, clean salon when there are easily 3 salons on one street. Like most people, I am selective about where I go to get my nails done so a first person referral is a major plus when my friends and I booked with Infinity. 
Our first appointment was in May, after 3 months of sheltering and NO nail care available, we were in desperate need of manicures and pedicures. I am not going to lie, I probably would have settled for any nail salon out of desperation but as I mentioned the personal referral set a standard of expectations.  My poor fingernails were wrecked after 3+ months of gel polish that were overgrown that I removed my own gel nail polish and was left with a weak nail bed.  
I started off with a pedicure in the massage chair and it was absolutely amazing!   My nail lady gave me the best, most relaxing massage after my pedicure! I choose package no 2 which includes a massage and a gel treatment on my legs. That's not a treatment I usually select at my hometown spa so I was happy to be introduced to it! 
Next was my manicure.  I lost the length of my nails due to removing the gel polish at home.  As most salons will tell you - DO NOT remove your own gel polish because you can damage your nails. Mai was my manicurist and she suggested I use the dip color on my nails rather than gel as I had been for so many years.  My nails were incredibly short at the time but it's important to paint your nails to keep them strong which will stimulate nail growth.  The dip is a process as well, but it is less damaging to your nails compared to gel.  After 4 months, my nails were so long, I had to cut them down so I could type. 
Our nail shops are still not fully open and I still continue to travel to Infinity Nail Salon because of the excellent service. The salon is clean and spacious so if you have a few friends who want to pamper themselves, they have the space to accommodate your party.  I would highly recommend Infinity Nail Salon!",2020-09-15 22:58:02

I adore Bridge and Chocolate Bar, so I was excited to see what Range had in store. I have to go ahead and say that this was probably a 3.5 star experience, but I just can't stand to knock it down to 3, so we're going with 4 (and what is up with all the negative reviews?? Smells fishy if you ask me). ANYWAY....

I'm going to get my dislikes out of the way first (best for last, right?)...
- Our group of 6 was seated at the very far end, and I have to say this was kind of a bummer. Everything is very out in the open here, so we were right near the busing area, which kind of killed the atmosphere for me a little. It's cool that you can see into the kitchen (love love love that wall of old windows), but I'd rather not see ALL the bustle of the back of the house. Maybe that's just me. 

- Our waiter was a bit on the dull side and seemed almost annoyed with us (granted we are a bit loud, but we're nice, I swear!) Can't help that it was my bday and we were feeling jovial. He didn't even say happy birthday  :(

- Wait time to get the checks seemed excessive. He did apologize for this, but I was convinced he had died somewhere in the back. 

Ok, and now for the good stuff! Yay! 
- Like all Bailey's restaurants, Range has awesome decor and you can just tell everything is really thought out. The pace is long an narrow, and features one big long dining table down the center, which is super cool. There is also bar seating an a loft with smaller tables.  I'm a sucker for a well designed restaurant, what can I say. 

- Awesome drink menu! Their selection of craft sodas was mind boggling. Beer menu was extensive and the hard drinks looked amazing as well. 

- You can sub out all the burger patties with a veggie burger, bison burger, turkey burger and another option I can't recall, which I found pretty cool. 

- The homemade ketchup was the shit! I can't figure out what made it so damn good, but it was delicious. 

- My ABC burger was awesome. Never would have thought to put apples on a burger, but props to Kelly for her review because that's what made me order it and I'm glad I did! I will say the buns aren't proportionate to the patties, but nobody in our group had any complaints about what they ordered. 

- They brought me a banana split with a candle at the end of dinner. Never figured out if the waiter was just being nice or if one of my friends actually ordered it, but regardless it was a tasty end to a great meal.",2011-11-26 01:17:24
hKCFyfsYIT3OGQ33wwywAg,yIt95kzvQwnfLxCA1mv38g,-9h2RsUE0-KEvfxyHcsWHQ,1.0,2,0,0,"Quite possibly the worst company in business I have ever dealt with, with no exaggeration.  I can only blame myself for not listening to previous reviews on Yelp, which were spot on.  To say their owner ""Ben"" is a crook is a gross understatement.  He will not think twice about padding charges to an unfathomable level with no explanation or warning.  When we had a dispute with our final payment, his solution was to inexplicably increase the dues by another $300.  Not to mention, our dining table glass was completely shattered, and they misplaced another piece of our furniture their storage.  They will try to hook you by promising some deal on the phone, only to make up costs in excess by adding several hours of handling fees and unloading fees at their warehouse which will seem way out of proportion to the amount of items you are storing.  In the end, due to their nonbinding estimates and hidden charges, we payed well over $600 more than we would have for companies that gave us guaranteed estimates.  My only hope now is that others read this review and avoid the mistake we made in choosing this company.

ADDENDUM 10/11/14: To clarify further, in light of Benjamin's response, some of our major issues with this company occurred when they were moving our items FROM their storage...meaning they already had our full inventory of items and had already calculated the exact time it took them to unload items from storage, etc.  When it came time to settle the bill after the movers dropped off our items (excluding our shattered dining table glass and missing papasan chair), we had a dispute with how much we owed.  To be specific, the movers called their bosses at the company to confirm our outstanding charges, at which point the company RETROACTIVELY added an hour of storage handling charges to our bill which was NOT reflected in the final invoice that the movers had given us.  They claimed that they had inadvertently left off an hour of handling charges...whether or not this was true is irrelevant; it is merely highly unprofessional of the company to do this.  When we tried to dispute this over the phone with Benjamin himself, he inexplicably tried to raise our dues by another $300, without offering any explanation of charges.  He then instructed the movers/drivers to drive off with the moving truck, which still contained our bed frame, mattress and TV...in essence he was using our remaining items as ransom until he received our payment.  Our apartment security personnel had to lower the gates so that they could not drive off with our items, and we even had to call the police (who unfortunately had no role in this domestic matter).  We ended up paying for the extra hour of handling charges to receive our items.

It is not surprising that after seeing my post, the company leadership now would like to discuss my concerns over the phone as a means to save face in the eyes of other readers.  However, I have no desire for any further dealings with this company (Benjamin in particular).  I would urge readers to not let my review alone influence their opinion of this company...simply look to the innumerable one-star reviews given by similarly disgruntled customers.",2014-10-11 00:03:39
WsfXllcMVB32jyeRk2joFg,0aH9QrxAxD8tEEVVOVv3kA,g33s03KL3BTPgTPg_6r_Kw,4.0,6,2,6,"Finding mediocre Thai food anywhere you go is pretty easy these days.  Finding good Thai food is quite a bit harder.  I don't know why it took me so long to stumble upon Thai Phooket, but I'm glad I finally did.  It's become my #1 go-to place when I'm craving Thai in the Nashville area.

I've tried a host of different entrees at Thai Phooket, and none have disappointed.  Let me start with a few of my favorites.  Many people consider Pad Thai to be the premier dish in separating Thai restaurants from one another.  I'm not usually a big Pad Thai fan, so I don't know how or why I managed to order it as one of my entrees on my first trip there -- but boy am I glad I did.  Since that point, Pad Thai has been the one constant in every single one of my trips to Thai Phooket.  There are a couple reasons why I'm a big fan of their Pad Thai  First, the noodles are extremely well flavored (sometimes with a Pad Thai dish, you get some very plain noodles).  Second, the bean sprouts usually appear on the side of the plate.  If you're an unhealthy, bean-sprout-hating eater like me, it's all about the noodles, the chicken, and the peanut crumbles.  I LOVE that I don't have to slurp down veggies with their Pad Thai!

Thus far, I've tried the red, green, and ""sassy"" curries, and I've been generally pleased with all three.  (The sassy is really just a variant on the red curry, with pineapple and a couple other things mixed in.)  I wouldn't say either the red or green are the best curries I've ever had, but they certainly satisfy you if you're craving that sweet coconut milk flavor.  One observation:  Thai Phooket's curry is less creamy than some, and can be a little liquid-y (watery definitely wouldn't be the right word) for my tastes.  That said, if you take home leftovers, their curry solidifies a bit in the refrigerator and comes together very well -- which is especially true of the red curry.  I should in no way admit that I had leftover curry for breakfast at about 8:30 a.m. last Tuesday morning.

Speaking of coconut milk, if you have any hankering for a soup, the Tom Ka Kai is excellent.  Sweet and addicting, it's the perfect way to whet your appetite for your entrees.  You can order it by the cup, bowl, or firepot.  While getting the tray with the flame is fun (seriously, what guy doesn't like fire?), I think the bowl offers the best bang for your buck.

Between the regular Kra Prao and its ginger-based counterpart, I'd have to vote for the regular.  It's pretty good.  The sauce is not as strongly flavored as some that I've had in other places, but it's definitely a solid choice nonetheless.

A few other nuggets of information:
* The location is very convenient if you're anywhere near East Nashville.  While it's a bit of a hole in the wall, I see that as a good thing.
* Service has always been friendly and attentive.
* Prices are pretty darn reasonable.
* Sitting outside on the patio is really nice when the weather's cooperating.
* They'll kick the spice up for you if you want it.  In addition, the side tray of spice condiments is something I've gotten accustomed to in Thai restaurants in other cities, and Thai Phooket does a great job with theirs.  At some places, you'll find the chilis in fish sauce is heavy on the fish sauce and not so much on the chilis.  Not so at Thai Phooket!  I'll usually load these on my entrees.  While this is definitely an acquired taste, it adds a ton to my enjoyment of my meal (even if it does mean I'll be paying the price for it the next day).",2010-11-10 21:11:29

When you've lived here long enough, you actually stop noticing it  - even BECOMING it - until you visit another city, and everyone there seems as if they're 3/5ths into a serious narcotic high: friendly, happy, talkative, relaxed.  When you visit that other city, people might say ""HI!"" to you on the street or at a bar, and it makes you feel suspicious - but then you realize: you've become a Philadelphia asshole.

I was recently browsing WIKIPEDIA.COM and learned that the French invented the term ""déclassé"" when they first visited the original settlement of Philadelphia in 1524.  I learned that we put the ""phil"" in ""philistine"".  Worse yet, I learned that many years ago corruption was almost eradicated from the collective human consciousness, but we Philadelphians kept it alive during this time much like the Arabs kept the Greek classics alive during the Middle Ages.  

This shittyness all seems to fade away when you visit Federal Donuts.  It's like walking into an alternate reality where Good Things actually happen in Philadelphia, and everyone is super elated about it.  For that brief moment when you first bite into a hot Indian cinnamon donut, we actually live in a first-rate city, with first-rate sports teams, first-rate city planning, and first-rate career opportunities.  For a split second, everyone is suddenly very attractive and has an interesting and articulate worldview.   You even think that, at long last, you might not run the risk of getting your ass kicked or your throat slashed if you walk home alone in the middle of the night. 

Every customer of Federal Donuts is happy beyond reason.   Adorable, rosy-cheeked citizens cup steaming envelopes of hot donuts in their hands and hold them to their noses, smiling like they just won the lottery.   At lunchtime as the line winds out the door for fried chicken, truck drivers hold hands with be-mohawked feminists who hold hands with Mummers who hold hands with hipsters who hold hands with the guys who used to beat them up in highschool - and they sing.

Everyone knows that the donuts and fried chicken are fucking delicious, but I give Federal Donuts five stars and tons of credit purely for the fact that they've created an oasis of joy and civility in this otherwise bleak tundra of disappointment, violence, and despair.",2012-09-25 14:55:18
l3-Kxbb3_8F4j_zxkyeDHg,i-SfL9iPOWCNfEzahgbtlQ,zwGzwkVeYXE-tRisb8if7A,4.0,2,2,2,"Me and my friend were in Nashville minding our business about to head back toward Hendersonville to go to a chain restaurant when we passed by this place. At first I wasn't sure what it was (partly because I was driving and paying attention to the road and totally not texting, I promise) but when I saw the word ""thighs,"" my chicken radar started going crazy in my head and I violently jerked the wheel into the parking lot (no animals or people were harmed during this sudden change in direction).

When I stepped out of the car, I immediately smelled smoked chicken. I was hungry before, but when my nose activated, my stomach started growling intensely. It felt like there were grubby hands down there grabbing the vapor that was cascading down my esophagus, and once my esophagus got going my mouth started to water. I hadn't even entered the building yet.

Which, by the way, is quite unassuming. It's neon green and ""Smokin Thighs"" is plastered on it in massive letters. They aren't trying to be anything more than exactly what they are, and I love that about them. Inside is just as plain as the outside. It's a huge room with a bar in the back and normal tables and red chairs strategically scattered about the room. They serve their drinks in mason jars (love that!) and they even keep any extra jars that they have by the front door. If you want one, take one (no need to run afterward; they're free).

After our very-pleasant server took our order, we chatted and watched some sports on the TVs that line the walls. The ambience is very casual and a little loud, but people come here to have a good time and enjoy a good meal. Oh, and they serve moonshine, so I'm not surprised at the noise level.

My friend ordered the smoked chicken tacos and I got the thighs in a pile with the recommended pineapple and mozzarella. The chicken? It almost tasted too good. When I took my first bite, I looked at it, studied it, to make sure it was real chicken and not something else. Very tender, almost buttery, and the portion is plenty. The pineapple was a nice added sweet touch to the chicken, which already had bbq sauce on it. The mozzarella cheese was a bit pointless, in my opinion. It didn't add any flavor and it wasn't very melty, so I didn't understand its purpose. The baby carrots that come with the dish also seems pretty random. I didn't waste time eating mine.

I wasn't crazy about the mac 'n cheese side. I don't like bacon (I know I know, but I didn't grow up on it so I feel very ""meh"" about it) and I forgot to ask my server to take it off. I'm a mac 'n cheese connoisseur and their's is just okay. The hard bacon bits just got in the way. The roasted pile of corn, however, was very good. It exceeded my expectations, though I've not had much roasted corn in my day. It was cooked perfectly and had a nice, smokey flavor.

My friend loved her tacos. She didn't say that to me but she also didn't say anything to me at all while we were eating (she's chatty), so I know she loved her food.

I loved the presentation of everything. The food came on what looked like an old single-size pizza pan/tray. The entire atmosphere here is very down to earth and comfortable.

The next time I visit (and there will be many ""next time's"") I'm going to try their wings and nachos. I almost know their nachos are going to be amazing, but wings are not made the same everywhere. If their wings are good, I'll probably boost my rating to a 5.",2017-03-04 20:25:37
Pc7hzT7MiHa2e5KHa9bZnw,moz1VXqvaWzVjVKaAFO8ZQ,OChSrnaj5tQ1-wm7zoVT4w,3.0,1,0,0,"Now that I've made several visits, it's high time to leave a review. Food-wise, Gyu is generally good when it comes to flavors. The beef sukiyaki bibimbop is delicious, and I am eternally grateful that the meat arrives pre-seasoned. The sauces are nothing hard hitting, but they get the job done: the spicy sauce is not spicy, the ponzu sauce is a saltier soy sauce, and the sweet soy sauce is exactly what it sounds like. 

If there's anything with the food, it's the execution. We came in early one time after the restaurant opened, and our meat was frozen, had dark centers, and was cut in a scraggly manner. On the latter, sometimes the meat is just poorly cut. I will always recommend the bistro hanger steak, because it can be tender regardless of how thick it is; cooking time is the deciding factor. It really depends for the other meats- the beef tongue we've had was always too thick, as was the kalbi short rib. On other matters, the miso soup is super salty and the salad is meh (too much dressing), but it's improved, as it seems as if they're adding some new ingredients.

The biggest issue is service. Even for a restaurant, the turnover is high, as out of all the years I've been coming here, I've never come to recognize an employee. This isn't the biggest deal, but it may be indicative of low pay or poor working conditions. In addition to that, the wait at the hosting station is a real toss up. With a reservation, we usually wait 5-10 minutes. Today, we waited around 25 minutes in a spotty dining room. How often your waitperson attends to you is also a shot in the dark. We've run the spectrum with both fantastic and negligent service. One time, our waiter was on top of everything- we got our food in a timely manner, and he checked on us frequently. Other times we get decent service, but more often than not we get a server who disappears for long stretches of time. I understand it may be busy, but having to wave down another server for the bill or a bowl makes it so that we're adding more of a load for them. 

So why do I keep coming back? 1. My family really likes the food, which IS decent. 2. The lunch special is a good deal. 3. Finding street parking isn't too difficult. 4. There's no real competition in the area for JBBQ.",2018-10-27 02:30:37

I basically have 2 pizza restaurants that compete for my whole hearted love. Falora or Scordatos. Each restaurant has positives and negatives in my eyes, but they equally excite me and I crave them both. This is not a post about Scordatos but rather Falora.

My husband took me out for a date night and I chose Falora. Pizza, wine, salad. That was my heart and my stomachs desire. Falora makes their Naples style pizza in a hand made Italian wood fired oven. The crust is outrageous. The crust in itself is enough to go for, and I never eat the crust. I get full too quick and try to eat the center of the pizza giving the crust to my husband. Oh and the kale salad! The kale salad is also reason enough to go. I'm sure there are other delicious salads on their menu, I think we've ordered one before, but i just can not stray away from their kale salad. Falora taught me to love kale back when they first opened. I've tried to recreate this gem of a salad at home and it just isn't the same. Its massaged with a cashew dressing, served with artichokes, olives, and sun dried tomatoes, and you will eat the whole thing. Trust me you will love Kale after this salad.Then the pizza comes out. Its perfect. Its flavorful. Its heaven. The best sauce uses San Marzanno tomatoes, they give it a robust savory flavor that is not sweet at all. I HATE sweet sauce. Their red sauce is perfection. The pizzas are a little small in my opinion. Online they say 13″ but working in a pizza restaurant the last 3 years has shown me what that size looks like, Faloras pizzas are between 9-11 inches. We wont get into semantics though, or did I just do that? Either way the pizza is heavenly and we loved how the Cura had whole roasted garlic in chunks. Garlic and I go way back in our love affair. The second pizza was the special of the day which was also good, but not mind blowing. I like mind blowing but this was nice and fresh.Overall we love going here and this place is cool on so many levels. You can bring in your own vinyl, the patio is sweet and intimate, and the family style tables inside are great for hosting family get togethers. I was excited to learn if you bring in vinyl during certain hours you get a free bottle of chianti and they have a promo from 4-5 as well. Falora is a great place for a date night and one of my all time favorite Tucson spots. If you're in the mood for some of the best pizza in Tucson, try Falora.",2016-05-11 20:33:17
UttuE65SGXgQex63VzKATw,mERtMvA-ZSone3Zs-IApLg,LO5yBY9uoowtq7FsaKPJXA,5.0,3,0,3,"Finally!  I keep hearing about the latest places that call themselves ""gastropubs"" and am almost always disappointed.  Most places manage an okay beer selection and fall flat on their faces when it comes to food.  Kraftwork is exceptional in both respects and ups the ante with deliciously crafted cocktails (Corbusier -- a tasty drink that contains absinthe?  How novel!) and a  small but well-chosen selection of wine that accommodates the wino in me.

On to the real meat of the place: the food!  Anyone can invest in a lot of taps and a beer consultant, or throw in the kitchen sink when it comes to bottles (Kraftwork has none), but I'm almost always left wanting when it comes to  the ""gastro-"" part of ""gastropub"".   The menu size is restrained and the descriptions are simple, but everything I've had delivers big time in the taste, preparation, and usually size.  And usually contains substantial amounts of meat.  The burger -- medium-rare, Point Reyes Blue(!) and bacon onion jam(!) -- is the new burger to beat in Philadelphia.  The ""Crispy Pork Terrine"" are lovely little crispy fried, melt-in-your-mouth balls of porky deliciousness.  The charcuterie board, including an unhealthy portion of non-fried (but bacon wrapped) rabbit terrine, was nearly meal enough for two.  The meat finale is a ""pork crispy treat"" -- crackling substituting rice crispies, topped with chocolate and bacon.  It's a meat-eater's dream come true.   

On the vegetable side, the ""fiddlehead ferns"" special was a remarkably simple but satisfying dish.  I was told by the server that they're only in season for a short time and would be taken off the menu as soon as they were no longer freshly available.  I'm used to hearing discussion of seasonal veggies in fine dining establishments, but it's nice to hear that a pub is basing their menu on the freshness of their produce.  There's a veggie plate in addition to the charcuterie board.  The ""faux gras"" tastes nothing like the real thing, but was a good, rich, creamy, buttery slab of non-meat products -- all i could pick out  specifically was garlic.  

For me, the fish was 50-50.  Most yelpers seem to be partial to Monk's mussels, but I think Kraftwork's easily give them a run for their money.  Maybe I just went on a good night.   The Trout BLT, on the other hand, was, well, fishy.  Trout is a fishy fish, and I should've expected this, but I guess I was just expecting them to miraculously balance it out or cover it up with bacon or sauce.  They don't.  It's definitely a trout sandwich.  Period.

I can't say enough good things about this place.  It's actually motivating me to trek up to Fishtown from South Philly.  I almost wish it were further away so I could burn off more of the calories I consume in beer, pig, beef, pig, rabbit, and most everything else they're cooking up.",2010-06-03 22:50:39

I'll start with the reasons why I'm taking away two stars and unfortunately they all have to do with the restaurant. When we got in, I had two drinks at the bar. The next day while at breakfast, I checked my credit card statement and I noticed my card was never actually run. Weird. So I mentioned it to the restaurant manager. Part of me thought she would have done what I would have done back in my Ritz Carlton managerial days: thank the guest for their honesty and tell them not to worry about the charge. But she actually never once thanked me for my honesty and for bringing that to her attention and instead went out of her way to charge the card. She asked what I got and I told her. She couldn't find these particular wines on the menu in the restaurant at which point I was sure she would say 'hey do not worry about it, just come back and see us.'..Or something to that effect that you'd expect from a four seasons. Instead she and the host went on a search in the bar for the menu I had ordered from to figure out exactly how much to charge me. In the end, she did charge me for the two glasses of wine I'd had the night before. 

Onto breakfast - oomph. I was pretty thrown off by the fact that it seemed like 5 different servers interacted with me during my meal. Who was ""my server""? It seemed a little too much. I ordered English breakfast tea and the chia pudding with fruit and it was all great. No complaints about the meal itself. The fruit on the chia pudding was particularly delicious and you could tell it was fresh. I would definitely order this again! However, while the food was a hit, the service was a miss for me. When I'd asked the server if the chia pudding was vegan, he did not know. You'd think, again because it's a Four Seasons (!), that they would be extremely knowledgeable about their menu. Of course he did go check for me and assured me that it was. THEN, about halfway through my meal, I had told a server (again, it really was not ever clear who ""my server"" was) that I was going to use the restroom and be right back. I'd taken my wallet and phone with me but had made it clear to him that I'd be returning. When I got back from the restroom 5 minutes later, the entire table was cleared. What?! To make a long story short, a couple minutes later they brought back out the same exact meal I'd been eating and I continued on with breakfast. Maybe something you'd expect from your run of the mill Hilton? Not what you expect at a Four Seasons. Did not receive any apologies for clearing the table either. Again, I put myself in that situation as a server (or manager) at a 5-star property and I 100% would have brought the guest an entirely new meal. The chia pudding cost them maybe $3 to make and they charge somewhere around $16 for it...this is called simple service recovery. In short, was not impressed with the dining experience overall. 

Onto the good. Aesthetically, this place is to die for and the location couldn't be beat. Maybe 20 steps from the ocean. The grounds of the hotel are just immaculate. The property is extremely well taken care of from top to bottom and every inch is just beautiful and everything seems exceptionally clean. The entire vibe of the place made me feel like I was on the  Amalfi Coast - particularly the pool area and the tile in the bathrooms. The rooms (and closet especially) are spacious and well done. 

Overall, I would definitely come back here but would probably choose to eat out rather than dining at the restaurant again.",2019-09-22 00:34:09

Wrong. My first visit in March, when I walked up to the building, I wasn't sure where I was going bc the worship center is in the back. A male greeter looked at me and then the other young lady walking up (we both parked in the visitor's lot) and he then walked over to her and said, ""I see you're new here."" I was thinking, ""Really?!""  We were close enough to each other that he could've brought us together and said, ""hey, I see you're both new here.""  Anyway, I accidentally walk into the children's center (I have no children) bc I saw people entering there (and I'm apparently stupid and didn't see the GYM sign). I stood in line at some computers thinking they must take attendance this way.

I said, ""that's OK, apparently I'm invisible today"" and then said that I didn't need to register. I then tried to walk into apparently what was the children's center, and got stopped bc I didn't have a nametag. I expld what I was trying to do and 2 men pointed in the direction I needed to go to get to the worship center. I walked the way they pointed, and got stopped again bc I didn't have a nametag and was about to walk THROUGH the children's hall to their rooms. I completely understand the reason I couldn't enter, but why those 2 men didn't tell me to go outside and around, was beyond me. Finally, that greeter told me to go out and around. At this point, it took me everything not to get back in my car and drive to the hotel. I walked to the worship center, trying not to cry, but did anyway. Another greeter spotted me and finished walking with me. Fine, I'm in. The music was good, sermon was great, and some nice woman sat near me. We talked, I told her of my bad experience and she said she loved the church and I should give it another try. I came back to FL 2 mths later, went back to this church, the woman and I talked again, and turns out she was in need. I expld to her that churches can help and even found someone for her to call with her need. I texted her his info and told her to call.  She called and left a message the next day.  TWO WEEKS later they still didn't call her back. I emailed them, NO RESPONSE!  What?! Is this the kind of church they want to be?!  What is wrong here? She finally told me she talked to them and they weren't able to help her. I can't for the life of me understand how a church that big wasn't able to help a single mother in desperate need. smh  I am saddened and this should be a lesson for them that things need to change.",2018-05-31 22:15:47

It was your first wax and not once were you curious about how long your hair should be? I'm still in my early 20's yet when I'm about to try something new, especially with my lower regions, I do research. Mrs. Ken did warn you but I guess she felt guilty because you were leaving for your trip so she did say she will try even though due to your lack of research and hair, the wax couldn't grip onto the hair. So yeah, I guess that is Mrs. Ken's fault.
Yup, totally her fault that she is just one person so when her phone rings, she has to answer it, how else would she book appointments? Many times Mrs. Ken has answered the phone while I'm basically spread eagle but I completely understand because maybe when I called to book my appointment (that I had yesterday) someone else was getting waxed and mrs.ken had to take a moment. She is only one person.
Oh, I love that you created an account just to bash Mrs.Ken yet you didn't mention the back wax your boyfriend received from her before you got waxed. According to your boyfriend, he loved it. But I guess you couldn't mention that because he can't screw up his back hair by shaving it a week and a half ago could he? I should probably mention that I stopped by to see if mrs.ken could do an eyebrow wax that day even though it was such short notice, sometimes she can. I feel bad that your boyfriend had to call mrs.ken on your behalf because you were so upset even though he said she did an amazing job on his back. Oh I feel terrible for him. 
Anyway, went there yesterday to get a wax, she had two customers, one that is 90 years old and such a great lady who got her nails done and waiting for them to dry, and another who mrs.ken was finishing up her eyebrows. I appreciate mrs.ken because it doesn't hurt and she does a great job. I do not mind waiting a few extra minutes because the service and quality outweighs a few minutes of waiting. I get waxed every 3 weeks and I look forward to the waxing because I've been waxed from King of Prussia to Philadelphia and all the surrounding areas between. I'm prone to ingrown hairs but mrs.ken has that on locked down to the point I never get them anymore. I get compliments on my eyebrows when I don't even fill them. I've been told my eyebrows are fierce. Mrs. Ken knows what she is doing and I'll be happy to continue to do business with her. She is a bundle of joy that knows what she is doing.",2014-07-31 16:02:05

We really had a beautiful evening celebrating my lovely wife's birthday. We had been to a similar concept in Kansas City but never tried our hometown favorite here in Indy! 

Service was truly charming, despite the unusual Wednesday night traffic and our server seemingly being spread over a couple of sections. She was truly fantastic very complimentary of our beverage choices and dinner choices. She was well versed in our gluten intolerance. It's a shame so many servers are more like this one because she knew her gluten trivia and had thoughtful recommendations. 

The view of the city was breathtaking and perfectly romantic for my lady's special day. She enjoyed the fillet which was perfectly butterflied with a creamy sherry sauced scallop potato with the wonderful addition of asparagus for some brilliant greenery on the color palette. 

I enjoyed a glass of sauvignon blanc, delicious and perfectly paired with the Panko Red Snapper. The snapper was so good! Typically I am not a fan of buttered sauces, but you had me at jalapeno butter sauce. Creamy with a touch of spice. For those of you that do not like spicy this is really a low spicy nothing too extreme. A well thought out pico on top of a bed of creamy rice. Rice and I do not usually get along, it is usually too filling for me and feel gross afterward. This rice was delicious! I probably will not eat any other rice but this rice. Well done! 

Truly a delightful experience! 

If there is any room for improvement it might only be in the hosts seating strategy and welcome to the restaurant. Upon arriving we had to wait a moment for the host to return as he was retrieving a cup of Joe, which i do not blame him it was a cold night and probably slow before we arrived. Simply the finer details I did not necessarily need to know. Seating seemed to be all in the same section while he did not seat us directly next to another party we were just a couple of tables down from a louder party. Like I said finer details. If a quiet table is important to you I would be sure to request it. The host was extremely hospitable and truly warm in welcoming and chatting with us as we waited for the elevator. He earns five stars for his hospitality but for professionalism maybe four. He was telling us that they often have trouble with the elevators and sometimes only one works. I like you, my friend, but a word from the wise don't advertise your faults have had people perceive something other than what I have intended when making conversation about problems we have had at our restaurant. Keep it up though you are excellent at what you do! 

Thank you Eagle's Nest for being such a long standing romantic hot spot in downtown Indy. My wife and I are sure to return!",2012-12-02 13:56:14

Crab & corn chowder: 5 stars all the way. So light, not too cheesy or heavy. Good amount of crab meat.

Crab and shrimp etouffee: 4 stars. Sauce was decent. Instead of rice, pasta was the base starch. It was a thick rolled pasta so the interior was sauce-free and with every bite, a plain pasta noodle would be tasted. I think I would have preferred a open macaroni or rice (so the sauce could coat more surfaces).

Spiced apple glacee with rum ice cream: I loved the ice cream a lot. The spiced apple was really wonderful. The pastry holding the filling was good, but I suppose I wanted a wetter dessert so I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. 4 stars.

I tried the bread pudding and it was nice. I only got a small spoonful but I'll give it 5 stars.

I tried many bites of my friend's ribeye: I want to give it 6 stars out of 5! It's the reason that even though I have hangups about the etouffee and my apple dessert, I have to give Luke 5 stars. The steak was perfefctly cooked, wonderful buttery texture. But the flavor, the flavor was out of this world. It was like the steak was infused with a nice beef broth (think a fine pho soup). I didn't know beef could have such strong beefy flavor - I've never experienced that before. I would come here to eat that ribeye every day if I could.

Great french fries.

The only BAD: During the meal, there was a incredibly loud drunk man who came in and started conversing with a drunk spanish speaking family(?)/friends. The 'family' group sat at the table next to ours (each person had their own Bourbon St. fishbowl) and proceeded to yell loudly over other diners to their guy at the bar. That I didn't mind as much as other diners. HOWEVER, the man's laugh was shockingly disruptive to all conversation at our table. So loud and piercing. I've *never* before had my thoughts interrupted by the laugh of someone across the room in a crowded restaurant. He laughed at a rate about once a minute. The staff did tell the family they couldn't yell to their friend anymore after 10 minutes or so. They did nothing about the laughing man, much to my dismay. The flavor of the steak was actually good enough for me not to knock my rating of Luke down because of the atmosphere I experienced. But there is still a part of me disappointed in the restaurant as a whole due to that man.",2017-12-21 07:00:47
3wCMfoj7qwUtKZ6I0trs7A,WMqjgWI3gbUAKtlUX5MnWA,g-O-YjEYenfh3Rl6DyQBKg,1.0,0,0,0,"My wife and I visited Ackerman Jewelers to adjust/update her Tacori engagement ring.  To provide a bit of background, I was in the jewelry business for over 20 years and understood exactly what I was hoping to do. 

We were in a bad accident and her original diamond was lost out of her setting.  To modernize her setting and buy her a new diamond was our goal.  My wife purchased the diamond from our friend (still in the jewelry business) and her Tacori setting.  Because she selected a heart shaped diamond, the finished look was not something she was able to envision.

Fast forward a couple of years and the reason for going to the store now was to replace the head/basket of the setting so the bottom of the diamond could get cleaned.  The ring itself was/is beautiful but without being able to clean the diamond, lost a lot of the sparkle one expects from an engagement ring.

We walked into the Ackerman Jewelers on Kennedy Blvd and after a short visit was basically told that only their other store in Tampa would be able to make the type of adjustment/repair we wanted.  We went into the other store which is considerably further from where we live and dealt with George.  George began to explain that since it is a Tacori setting, they have a ""contract"" with Tacori that prevents them from making alterations.  Again, as being in this industry for decades, there is no contract but there is definitely an understanding that they wouldn't do this type of alteration.  I began to ask for them to send it Tacori to do since what we wanted was not extraordinary and everybody should be able to see that.  Tina Ackerman was nearby (we had never previously met her) and as we were on our way out, she interjected very nicely that they would be happy to send the ring to Tacori for us and it didn't matter where we purchased the ring from. 

During the immediate following week I heard from my friend at the store where the ring was originally purchased that Ackerman wanted them to take care of us and NOT Ackerman.  To our surprise what Tina apparently said in the store face to face was not what she had in mind.  Since the original store was up in NJ and we are now in FL, my friend suggested I take care of it locally.  I contacted Tacori directly and was told by the Tacori rep that it was Tina Ackerman herself that told them at Tacori that they didn't want to help us because we were rude and aggressive.  Once more, I was in this business for so many years and have dealt with less than friendly and nice customers.  We were far, far from rude and aggressive.  If we were rude, why would you take the ring from us and assure us that they would help?  Why would we be rude when we NEEDED your help? Why would you take the ring from us to take photos and send to Tacori if you had no intention of helping us?  Why wouldn't you just ask us to leave (even though we were already on our way out)?

Subsequently, we went to IDC and now have a gorgeous new Tacori ring that we were happy to spend the money on to get sparkle back onto my wife's finger.  Fortunato at IDC was pleasant and MORE THAN willing to help us.  There is NO THANKS to ACKERMAN, just aggravation and a feeling of betrayal. Being called rude and aggressive from a store owner is beyond poor representation for a store; it is reprehensible.",2020-11-27 21:30:38

And when you're a restaurant where people are going to eat, that's not good.

I've eaten at this place for countless dinners, lunches, girls night outs, and happy hours, so I've pretty much experienced the full spectrum of what they do. The staff are always extremely nice and helpful (e.g., when I dined here for a birthday lunch recently, when our waitress overheard me wish the birthday girl a Happy Birthday, she went out of her way to get our table some free desserts to share!), the atmosphere is nice (they have a really nice patio), and if you come for happy hour or their Thursday girls' night out promotion, the prices are great too. 

HOWEVER, I always find the food here really lackluster and inconsistent... some dishes are quite good (though I never think anything on offer is anything special or different from your standard Nashville ""American fusion"" that restaurants in this town seem to love) while others look and taste a mess. Some of the food is really bland and lacks seasoning (or was poorly conceived, using ingredients that just don't have tons of flavor to begin with), while other items have been really over-salted (my pet peeve!). Take the grilled cheese with portabella mushroom sandwich I ordered at lunch: totally flavorless and bland, but the cup of soup I subbed in for the chips was so salty I couldn't eat it. I guess if I dipped my sandwich in the soup it would be a perfect meal, but I'd rather each item was seasoned correctly to begin with!

Also, I take issue with Sunset's claims that they are all about sustainable food sources, because one of the specials they were offering when I dined there was a NEW ZEALAND John Dory dish. I realize that not all restaurants do the ""local food source"" thing, but according to Sunset's menu, they pride themselves on using ""sustainable local"" products when they can... Can you imagine the carbon footprint on a piece of fish coming all the way from NZ? It's about as far away Nashville as you can get and seems to fly in the face of the claims their menu is making. Make of that what you will, but I'm thinking that proclamation of theirs is kind of bullshit.

Anyway, food ethics aside, if you subtract the food from your dining experience, Sunset is a nice place to spend some time, but really, I am always disappointed and underwhelmed whenever I eat here and I always say each visit will be my last. It's unfortunate that I have so many friends who seem to like it here, but as far as I'm concerned the bottom line is this: there are many other better Nashville restaurants in the same pricepoint, doing the same style of food with the same kind of ambiance, so despite all the things it gets right, Sunset is eminently skippable.",2011-10-07 16:34:20

Not only was I racially profiled by the financing manager Hope but I was penalized for their Sales person Dionna not knowing her own job. My fiancé and I saw Fucillo's commercials and thought we would give it a try. We got there last Wednesday at around 10:30am keep in my I bring my 10th month old son. We had a budget in mind and saw a car online we were interested in. we told Dionna we were interested in the used cars in our budget she proceeded to get 3 keys for cars to test drive that were in our ""budget"". So we test drove a Kia Forte which she said was in our budget and me being gullible was so excited. She didn't even bother to show us the other cars until my fiancé's grandma mentions it. She showed us a Nissan versa which was in our budget and we asked if we could see if we could get approved for either so we sat inside. They then took our information and all the needed documentation, the finance manager then comes out, looks at me and says ""Do you have your visa to be in this country?"""" Are you a US Citizen?"" Mind you I have an Arizona License and was born and raised in Arizona. My faince, his grandma and I were so flabbergasted. I never in my whole life was asked if I was a citizen based on my dark features and last name. I asked her if I could give her my birth certificate because I only knew my social security number and didn't have the card she then told me those could be forged. She never asked my Italian fiancé if he had a visa to be in this country. Dionna then offer to drive me to get my social security card from home after we had been sitting there for 6 hours which I explained to her I did not have so she insisted we drive there as the whole time she is driving she is snapchatting and texting with my 10 month old in the car!!  Of course I couldn't find my social security card like I told her and we go back to the dealership and we wait another hour for Dionna to come up to us as say "" how much do you love me, you guys are approved for the Forte!"" so we waited for the documentation for 2 more hours for them to tell us we can get anyone to finance you but we found a car a while ago that you qualify for and is in your budget. mind you the whole 9 hours I sat there they ran my credit for the Kia Forte which turned out to be $17,000 and definitely not in our budget. WHY DID YOU NOT TELL US THAT BEFORE WHEN WE WERE WAITING THERE FOR 9 HOURS TO RUN OUR CREDIT FOR A CAR WE TOLD YOU WE COULDN'T AFFORD??? Keep in mind the whole time we were waiting Dionna keep saying how one of her customers wife hates her and thinks she is trying to get with her husband and snap chatting. At that point we just wanted to go home our son was tired as were we so we said fine and waited for the documentation on a Hyundai Accent. We looked over the contract which I said I didn't want to have payments for more than 3 years and I told Dionna that and she said it was only two and a half years. 55 months is two and a half years?? We finally get to leave with our new car at 8:30pm. Over the weekend my phone had broke so I did not receive any calls Dionna and Hope had called my fiancé twice each before we receive a voicemail from Hope saying "" I have tried to contact you and your fiancé several times ( it was only twice) and if you don't not  call me I am sending someone to pick up the car"".  So of course I called her back and explained to her my phone had broke and she said Dionna told you to bring the car in Friday to get a GPS which you never showed up for and you need to get Florida license and I said we were never told we needed a GPS and no were in the contract says we had to. I told her I would come in a get the GPS the next day and we would have our Florida licenses by the end of the week which she had agreed to. The following day I tried to get ahold of a manager to discuss why I was not informed I needed a GPS as well as to let him know Hope had racially profiled me. I kept getting transferred then hung up on, I finally get ahold of the manager who says he cannot resolve my issue because he is the service manager and transfers me and of course the call doesn't go through. I left work early to drive down there and get the GPS put in and we are greeted by a salesman and explained why we were there Hope then calls us into our office she sat us down and says "" My general manager wants to keep the car until you get Florida licenses"" and we explained to her I can get my license Wednesday  no problem ( I am the main person on the car) and she said my fiancé would have to as well. He does not have his birth certificate so we would have to order it which would take about two weeks she then said "" just overnight it its only $80 I did that with mine from Georgia"".

We went on the train for the Foliage tour.  It is not the railroad fault that it rain and poured on 3 days before this event. We arrived 45 minutes prior to the start of our tour.  We approached the gate and sadly there was no one there. 
I got out of my car, while my husband parked to the side. I was looking for someone / employee , asking for some direction on how to get in. I did find someone who was dressed in black and white ( railroad attire). He verbally stated that they were short staffed today. And proceeded to go to the gate house.  
I was also upset that no one was there at the gate to open it on time. And I am also upset that the parking cost $20!!!   $20 for a 75 min train ride! That was pretty steep
Price, more expensive  then 1 parking in New York. 
We had a reservation for the first train ride of the day. 
We waited on the platform while it was pouring rain. I believe we were seated a little bit late.  The reason from my observation , the workers were still cleaning , vacuuming and still stocking the train.   We purchased a first class ticket on line , which included a non- alcoholic drink and a light snack for a fee. 
There was a female employee who was trying to seat us in certain seat. My husband and I sat where we wanted. We did not have a full first class caboose.  There was also a employee who was narrating our 75 min train ride.   
He did mention that the rain did not help our foliage tour.  He gave us some history of the houses along our train route.  One of the houses we saw was once owned my the artist Worhol. 
There was also an employee that was taking orders for our free non alcoholic drink and light snack for a fee.  Our table  ordered coke, ginger ale,  pretzel and the people across from us ordered 2 hot coffees.   Before the train ride ends - the male employee gives you a check of the items ordered and amount due. 
The train ride was very bumpy and shakey. The chandeliers on the train were rocking back and forth, I will not lie I was a little afraid. But the train is safe. 
I did appreciate that the conductor did punch the train tickets and I also did like that he told stories about the train.  The conductor was kind enough to also take photos with us.   
I do recommend this train ride.",2019-10-31 02:16:43

I've been here before years ago and liked it, but stopped coming when I overpaid for a pedicure and they used something I was allergic to in the soak water.  
This time I came in and it was busy, but the lady at the door told me to sit at the center waiting table and look at colors.  I had sat down less than a minute before another lady grabbed my things and told me to sit at a manicure table.  She started filing off the previous gel and put my fingers to soak in a bowl of acetone.  I'm used to the individual finger tin foil soak-off but didn't think much of it.  Until nearly 20 minutes passed!
The only woman who spoke English (mostly) walked past me multiple times while I was sitting there but finally sat down after 18 minutes of my hands in acetone. She asked me multiple times what color I wanted and I explained I hadn't had a chance to look through the colors because my hands had been in bowls of acetone for 20 minutes.  She got a bit nasty and said ""only 10.  It's better for your nails than me filing all the color off."" 

At this point I considered just paying for the soak-off and leaving, but I was honestly too frustrated to try to do so civilly.  She asked if I wanted just color or nail care - her trimming my acetone trashed cuticles cost me an extra $5. There was supposed to be a moisturizing soak and hand & arm massage with it, but I didn't get either. 

She did do a good job on cuticle care (though she pulled the cuticle a lot while trimming them) and shaping my nails.  The color was well-applied but the top coat had a few sticky spots after the light cure.  

There are very few people you can communicate with directly here.  The one woman I dealt with was translating for the other women working, and when things were too difficult to translate she asked the customer to wait and she would just do it.  The woman that helped me wasn't easy to communicate with, so I'm guessing that's where a lot of former yelpers issues with not getting what they wanted/being overcharged comes from. 

Also, her daughter is adorable - but when I'm spending $28 for a manicure (and already stressed by the mom's lack of professionalism) I don't want a  young kid asking me ""what color?"" Repeatedly, constantly asking her mom questions, or getting into things and making noise.  I'm paying to be pampered - not getting 1/4 of someone's attention, a bad attitude, and super-dry hands from chemical soaking.  

Won't be giving this shop a third chance.  Sorry.",2018-06-07 21:49:31
Jo2WUnD1xKKi8dgcBoMvhw,E41ct4KxNmwyBKuYJc0epA,i9rqSiwl3EAXWU9XA1YyOw,2.0,2,0,0,"We tried this place after getting a coupon in the mail. It's in the mall but has access from the outside, and has a patio that will be nice in the summer.

Things started off well enough, it's comfortable, has plenty of room and a great craft beer selection. The menu is everything you would expect from a BBQ joint - pulled pork, wings, ribs, sandwiches, etc etc. Missing is anything without meat - even though the place IS a BBQ joint, a group of diners often includes somebody who does not eat meat. They would be out in the cold here, even the mac and cheese has bacon bits. 

Our food was decent - not spectacular - we got wings, mac and cheese, and a Cuban sandwich. Portions were reasonable - not huge, not small, just about what I wanted to eat. Each table had about five sauces ranging from a honey mustard to fire sauce, all good with varying levels of heat.

The service was friendly but somewhat lacking, we were never offered refills on drinks until the end of the meal (even when they brought the food). A tablet-like gizmo is provided on each table with the option to summon the server and pay, but using this didn't appear to make the server appear any faster.

The gizmo also included a variety of games, but each costs $1.99 to play. The only free app is one that allows you to order dessert.

I would have given this place three stars, but things got a little weird at the end of our meal. Our server finally showed up and told us that when we went to pay using the gizmo, to please rate the service very high since the amount of work hours they were offered depended on the answers to this survey. I'm all for helping underpaid servers get more hours or better pay, but this request left us feeling sort of uncomfortable. Yeah, we left a high rating (don't want to be jerks), but frankly it was undeserved. Another question on the survey - did the manager visit your table during the meal? Well, I assume they did, since three people brought our food. But I had no idea who they were and they weren't very chatty.

This place has some potential but they have to move past this corporate mentality. Train your people well, then let them be people instead of cogs in a metrics-controlled machine.",2016-03-25 03:05:07
D8eq-PRwoR0oaYP5DZyZ8w,ILbXNwkzETWindcxErcpgA,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,1.0,0,1,0,"Review is from brunch on 07/25/21. 

Based off of other reviews, you would expect to be in for quite a treat both food and service wise. The only way to explain the great food reviews is that these folks never regained their sense of taste and smell after a bout of Covid. 

My friend ordered a Selena craft cocktail... A refreshing sounding combination of gin, Mezcal, aperol, lemon and watermelon. If you love drinks that have no flavor and taste like nothing, then I highly recommend this. Otherwise, go with a chilled glass of bathwater... At least it will have some flavor to it.

I ordered probably my favorite Mexican brunch dish... Huevos rancheros. Turns out the restaurant theme... Bland and tasteless... spans the entire menu, not just the drinks. I just assumed that they had run out of salt in the kitchen, but when I asked for some on the side, the waitress (I'll get to her in a moment) brought some over (begrudgingly) and it at least made the dish palatable. Does anyone actually taste the food that they send out anymore? My friend, being vegan... was super excited to try this place and ordered one of the vegan dishes. Two bites in (make that three... As I took one bite to confirm)... it was so bad that not even salt could save it and she left her plate virtually untouched. 

That covers the food and drink, now on to the service... Or should I say lack thereof. I'm certain that the waitress shows up for a root canal with more enthusiasm than she brought to our table and yet, we still tried to be personable with her to no avail. I wish I could say that the automatic 20% gratuity (a travesty) was to blame for her flat demeanor, but I'm pretty sure she just doesn't care. She brought a can of beer to the table with no offer of a glass from which to drink it (classy). A third friend of ours showed up 20 minutes after we did... instead of recognizing the new addition while at another table less than 3 feet away, she left her sitting there to go work on her frown face for another five minutes. Compliments where they are due... She has perfected the frown :( True to form, when bringing the check and seeing an untouched plate of food, she did not even ask or care if everything was alright (remember, she was getting 20% before we even sat at the table). As we were leaving, I pulled her aside and without making a scene, informed her of the poor food, drink, and service to which she responded... "" we will take that under advisement and do a better job next time"". I told her not to worry (which I know she didn't)... We won't be back!

In case you think I'm all doom and gloom, the restaurant does deserve one star for the decor... It was very festive and tastefully done!

 is so good that I no longer need to travel to Chicago. Bada bing bada boom.

My husband and I stopped in to Luke's yesterday for lunch after he told me he's driven by several times and always sees firefighters, police, blue collar workers and the like having lunch there. With that said, you know it's gotta be good. We were immediately greeted and when we told the young man at the counter that we'd never been, he said the Italian beef was really good and we should try it. I have friends who crave Portillo's and rave about Italian beef so I ordered Luke's Italian beef with everything. My husband took one look at the menu and saw that they had pastrami so he didn't look any further. The guy working the counter was pleasant and helpful. Luke Del Principe was up front at the counter and took time to greet us and talk for a minute. The man is a legend in the sandwich biz. 

I walked out the door to use the restroom (outside kinda like a gas station - but clean!) and by the time I walked back in, my guy was already seated with our food. Talk about fast!

I pulled the paper away to reveal my glorious, humongous, steaming hot sandwich. It was ""yuge!"" Tons of incredibly tasty, tender beef, melty cheese, giardiniera that is spicy, sweet and perfect for the sandwich and plenty of au jus to keep that baby dripping off your hands.  I thought there was no way I would finish it but guess what? I did.

Husband loved his pastrami - said it was the best pastrami he's had in Tucson. We've tried a LOT of pastrami because it's our favorite and I will agree with him - this pastrami is amazing.

We also ordered a couple of Chicago tamales for the heck of it. Uummm, no. I'm sure it's a thing somewhere but for this girl who is all about Mexican food and makes tamales, I say no. We each took a bite, shook our head and put it aside along with the unopened one which went directly in to the trash. Like I said - I'm sure it's a thing somewhere but it doesn't belong within a couple hundred miles of the Mexican border. 

So next time you're in the area, don't just drive by like we've done in the past. You would do yourself a favor if you stopped and ate at Luke's.",2019-01-24 16:40:31

So basically I will have missed out on their seafood theme on friday night so instead it was just their regular dinner buffet ($20.99).

Came in on a wednesday night not really having any high expectations based on the 3 star rating. Im glad I didnt because I was actually a bit impressed.

First round I went straight to the carving station because I swear I was a tyrannasaurus rex in a former life. Sampled the prime rib, st louis style ribs, and grilled veggies. Then I threw some baby red mashed potatoes and gravy on there along with one spicy chicken wing, one chipotle bbq rib, sliced brisket in bbq sauce, and ribeye simmered in some kind of gravy-like sauce. The prime rib was just ok. It was cooked med well and my preference is medium rare but nonetheless it was decent. The ribeye was pretty good. I was thinking they probably overcooked it since it was based in some kind of sauce but it was actually better than the prime rib. The ribs were just ok. The chipotle bbq rib was the same thing except it was slathered with chipotle bbq sauce. Get that rib instead. The brisket was terrible. Dry because it was overcooked. Avoid. The spicy chicken wing I enjoyed. The sauce they used tasted like a combination of sweet chili mixed with sweet n sour. 

Second round was for miscellaneous stuff that looked appealing to my eyes. Ended up sampling various foods from each themed section. Things worth mentioning here are the peeled shrimp, breaded butterfly shrimp, and various salad concoctions like antipasto and cucumber salad. Speaking of salad if that is what tickles your lettuce, they even have a create your own salad section which you dont even create yourself but you tell the guy behind the counter what ingredients you want and he will mix it all up in a large bowl for you.

Some honorable mentions because I already felt like I was about to give birth, were the ceviche and jello shots which were both in their own little cup. The Mongolian grill section where you mix veggies, meats and sauces in a bowl, give it to the dude behind the counter, and he will grill everything together for you. For you peeps that love sugar, their dessert section has a lot of variety like cheesecake, fruit tarts, cookies, gelato ( a couple flavors are sugar free for some of you diabetics), and too many others to mention. Im not a dessert person but after what I saw I will definitely save room for dessert next time.

Service was great. My server constantly came around and refilled my iced tea. It's always a good thing if you dont ever have to ask for anything. Grant it, you get the food yourself but being able to wash down your food at anytime without having to wait for a refill is appreciated. Whenever this happens, especially at a buffet, show your appreciation by giving them a tip that they deserve!

Lastly, here are some negative things that didnt really affect me but might to some other people. As I was getting my food a couple of the employees that work behind the counter were having a conversation about some argument over family. I dont mind them conversating but please, watch your language. Young kids might be walking around getting their food which I noticed earlier. Good thing they werent around when that conversation took place. As for the theme and decor of the place, they try to simulate like you're in the middle of the rain forest, kind of like Rain Forest Cafe, but the failed attempt kind. Every couple minutes you will hear what might be thunder, raindrops, strobe lights simulating lightning, then birds chirping like the storm just got done making way for the sun to come out. I was not impressed at all but if somebody had epilepsy, those flashing lights could cause seizures. They should build a night club and send this stuff over there where it might be useful.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by my experience and look forward to coming back whenever I get the chance. Maybe I will bring a local with me for you get 20 percent off when you show your ID.

We were happy to see a lot of groceries, stores selling italian food. 
We decided to have lunch there and try the most rated italian restaurant: Ralph's. 
That experience turned very soon into a nightmare! 
First of all the customer service is terrible. 
Then start with the food. 
We took an Antipasto that is basically a mix of cured meat and cheeses selection on a salad base. 
The cured meat had all the same flavour, and some of the cheese had mold on!!!!!! 
Then we took 2 white clams spaghetti 1 ravioli with marinara sauce, and 1 veal chop. 
Spaghetti: over cooked pasta, and was so evident that the pasta was not sauteé with the clams, but the 2 ingredients just mixed together. That pasta was beyond full of garlic and those clams were perfectly defrosted!! No trace of olive oil inside, but a huge quantity of a dark slimy liquid. That pasta was disgusting, uneatable, and unhealthy!!!!! Never eaten some clams spaghetti like that before ( in a bad meaning). 
Ravioli: hehehehehe. Call that stuffed pasta Ravioli it's an insult to the real fresh pasta. They were stuffed with an acid cheese that was not ricotta at all, covered with a small amount of similar sauce called marinara sauce, more terrible than the ravioli. Those ravioli sucked, like the spaghetti! 
Veal chop: have u ever eaten a piece of meat with no flavour? Yes I had. In that restaurant!! That veal chop was so sad, no flavour at all, hard like a wood shelf, unsalted, no trace of oil on. Then i asked some olive oil to pour on top, and the waiter came with a glass bottle full of a oily light yellow liquid. I tasted few drops and it was canola oil. I told to the waiter and he said that they don't have olive oil to serve. In italy canola oil is used in the car engines, not as a seasoning!!!! 
Then the bill came: 121$!! For that shit 121$!! I was so upset to waste all that money, but i was even more upset for the publicity of a fake italian food that the restaurant is making!!! That place is a cheap quality italian fast food imitation and should be taken out from any food guide!!! I went there because it's well rated!!!! Pls don't go there to eat, don't burn your money, that "" restaurant"" serves food for dogs.",2013-12-03 22:56:18
KVvC6zcX4aj9zAwRZ7_KTw,hDRGivuKGsWEMSLvAMxyOw,1_YCzfB3Eh1sMN0Nx4idvg,4.0,17,5,18,"The last time I was at the Indiana State Fair, I was Senior in the high school band participating in the band contest in front of the grandstand.  Since then I have traveled the country for work and the military before finally moving back to my home state in 2019.  Seeing the fair again brings back those four years of being at the fair, marching in the band contest and placing 7th (out of over 100 bands) in my freshman year.

We do anything for our granddaughters and with school about to start this was the perfect outing for us.  I will start with the parking at $10.  Why so much?  You can expect to have a bit of a walk from the parking area since no shuttles are provided to carry you to the entrance so wear some comfortable shoes. 

We started our fair experience with a ride on the Observation Wheel.  It is like a giant Ferris wheel but each car is completely enclosed with air conditioning and holds 4 or 6 people.  The cost is $10 a person which I thought was a little high for a party of four.  How about a discount for filling the car.  The wheel is over 150 ft high so we were able to get a wonderful view of the entire fair layout.

Next the granddaughters wanted slushes. These are the ones that you can mix about 15 flavors together if you want.  I had a few sips and they were pretty good.  The girls were all about the rides so we hit the shuttle (which was free) and it took us all the way to the midway.  We got to see the a lot of the fair along the way and some exhibits we wanted to come back to after the midway. 

The ride ticket line was long.  They only had one ticket booth open and only one person in that booth working.  The prices were what you would expect. One ticket was $1.50, 20 tickets for $25 or 50 tickets for $60.  The rides took 2-6 tickets each.  We opted for 100 tickets, which ended up being more than enough.  We gave away what we had left before leaving the area.  The lines for rides weren't bad at all when we got there but as the day went on the lines were longer.  So early is definitely better.

Our experience with getting food in the ride area wasn't good. They advertised chicken on a stick but when we asked for that they say we don't have any. We then asked for their curly fries and they also said they didn't have them either. My wife ended up getting chicken tenders and plain fries. Both were luke warm and greasy. $15 for food that went straight to the trash can. The food we got outside of the ride area was much better especially the funnel cakes.  We also asked for fried Oreos at another food booth within the Midway but again, all sold out.

We did get Caricatures of the girls and they were wonderful.  The man doing the drawings has Turrets and it is amazing watching him work.  You could get them with or without color.  $20 for a drawing and $25 for a drawing with color.  We wanted them to have something to remember the day and we know each time they look at these hanging in their rooms they will remember grandma and grandpa taking them to the fair. 

After the midway we went to the Pioneer Village.  They showed you what farming was like in the 1800's with all the old equipment and tools. Also showed quilting, rug making, wood baskets and bowls. There is also a section in the village for children. They learn about farming and feeding animals. There is a petting zoo and there will be pony rides starting on Wednesday. This section is geared more for younger kids but our 11 year olds enjoyed it too.  You may want to get some real maple syrup, or honey here.  They also have a booth where you can get ""real"" milk, ice cream or a glass of milk for 50 cents. The booth sign said they fill any baby bottles for free.

We did get our salt water taffy before leaving. Flavours include, vanilla, butter pecan, black walnut, cinnamon, strawberry, chocolate, anise, cherry and peppermint.  Expect to spend more than you think. There is nothing cheap but your family will have fun and create memories that will last forever. 
The fairgrounds was clean, there were stations offering sanitizer, and sunscreen.  They have lots of indoor restrooms, just use the map to locate them.  

There is a lot we did not see but after 6 hours we were tired and the girls were ready to head home. There is an app and website that you may want to look at for event schedules, activities or places of interest so you could plan your day. We went spur of the moment so nothing planned in advance. Whichever way you do it, planning ahead or just getting in the car and going, you will have a great time.",2021-08-02 13:54:07
SWUE8FGLmD4QGzDXUMb3Mg,T7pMGLAJL3zIX6cv6fQjQw,_QohBRBxWuwlIUuHj5_fZQ,2.0,0,0,0,"This hotel needs work. The grounds crew gets an ""A"" for their efforts, but the rest of the place gets a ""C"" for only doing the minimum necessary for this hotel to limp along.

Santa Barbara as a whole has really changed in the last few years. It used to be a beautiful and fun place to visit, go out during the day and night, and feel as though you were in paradise. Now, there are homeless people EVERYWHERE and the women in our group all mentioned not feeling safe to go outdoors, day or night. There are bums sleeping on the beach, hanging out at the kid parks, hanging out at all of the tourist spots, at the gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants, etc. Particularly disturbing, though, is that because this hotel is comprised of multiple buildings with direct access from the outside, you can hear the bums in the hallways in the middle of the night scrounging for leftovers on plates left outside of people's rooms.  The hotel recognizes a problem, and has a sign posted asking guests to not give anything to the homeless people because it encourages loitering. Hmmm...

Noise - We had an ocean-front room, and were looking forward to hearing the waves at night. The waves delivered perfectly. However, what we didn't anticipate was the train that runs along the rear of this property, and the joy the train engineers seem to get by blasting their horns for over a minute straight at all hours of the night. 2am, 4am, 6am, you name it. 

Dogs - As if the trains aren't bad enough, this hotel allows dogs in any and all rooms. See a spot on the carpet in your room? It's likely from a dog mess. Yuck! You hear dogs barking and whining as the night winds down. Most of the barking subsides by midnight, until... the train whistles come. Once that minute of blaring horn blowing is over, count on a few more minutes of the dogs barking again. If you have kids, of course, you know where this is going... Don't count on getting a lot of sleep here. When I asked the staff about the dogs, they just said ""Yup, dogs are allowed everywhere"". 

Rooms - They are old. For $400 per night, you'd expect to at least have nice rooms. The TV is current, and the linens are great, but the place IS old, and FEELS old. Things are broken, cracked, and are well used. Repairs are obvious by their mismatch. In contrast, the rooms at the Hyatt next door are VERY fancy. That hotel is about the same price (or even a little less) and our stay there last year was much more enjoyable.  I didn't hear any dogs there either.

TV & Internet - These work flawlessly. Channels change quickly, and there are a ton of things to watch. The remote didn't have any delay, and TV was a new(er) LG flat screen. The WiFi was a strong connection and delivered well.

Patio - Every room has either a balcony or patio, which is a huge plus. We enjoyed our patio every chance we could (which was whenever the neighbors weren't out smoking on theirs).

Water - While California is in the midst of a serious drought with water rationing, you'd never know it at this hotel. The shower, for instance, puts out no less than 15gpm (no, I didn't forget a decimal point). I didn't really need to use soap because the water came out like a sand blaster. 

Food - No quaint restaurant hotspots border this property, and the hotel charges no less than $20 for a sandwich. Room delivery? Add another $15 just for thinking of it.  There is a great little taco stand around the corner on Milpas, but we didn't find out about it until our last day and they're only open for lunch during the non-summer months.

Bar - The bar is very nice, both indoors and out. It has been modernized, and it sparkles.  Since there are no guest rooms near the bar area (most of the rooms are in different buildings entirely,) the vibrancy doesn't impose on anyone. The happy hour drink prices are surprisingly reasonable too. 

Pool - The pool is great. No complaints. 

Park - If you can keep a close watch on your kids, and don't mind the likely-pedophile bums watching nearby, there's a really nice park just next to this hotel. It's large, with lots of stuff for kids to do.

In short, if you're a single guy on an expense account and can sleep through anything, this is a fine place to hang your hat. For just about anyone else, you might want to look elsewhere.

The weather was perfect during our visit this year.  Thank you, Mr. Sun.",2016-01-30 20:45:15
O3i0bEuATLb_Mq0RQqNMRA,8MjlM_BJzxAyfitAXLIrqA,txfF_1H2QYtwgOSMN4vrdg,1.0,1,0,0,"This wedding chapel has a big note on their home page about road construction near the courthouse where you get your license and therefore they want to take you there, in a complimentary limo.  Take that very mis-represented statement as your first clue about the business tactics of this chapel!   1-- its real easy to check Nevada DOT road conditions online; they have snow in winter and many commercial trucking and transport professionals depend on their reports for snow/ mud slides, detours, repairs, etc. If you were in Las Vegas, road construction is a never-ending issue, but not so much in Reno. I have found Nevada DOT to be very user-friendly for local traffic and the interstate hwy.    2-- the office where you get a marriage license nowadays is located in a fairly new complex on the east side of Univ of Nevada Reno and the easiest way to get there is by using the freeway.  It is no longer the old traditional looking historic courthouse on Virginia Street near City Hall, just south of the Truckee River.  3-- IF YOU TAKE THE FREE LIMO RIDE, make your payment and make sure the clerk hands YOU your license.  Keep it in your safe and secure possession, it is good for a year and the marriage ceremony must be held in the county where the license was issued. The only time the chapel personnel need to see that document is after the ceremony is performed and then the clergy person will sign it.  The chapel does not need to get that document in their fingers one minute before the clergy is to sign the document.  If they ask to see the license, (there is really nothing they NEED to ""verify"")  show it to them but do NOT let it out of the grip of your fingers.  Do not let the limo driver grab the license-- saying something like ""we'll be taking care of everything for you""!!!  Because if you become upset with this chapel and want to have your ceremony held elsewhere, it will take a bunch of strong-arm talking to get them to return YOUR LICENSE back to you!!!!!!  And the license issuing office cannot create a duplicate document.  They don't want to re-issue an outstanding incompletely recorded document.  You can call the office and get them to explain their policy on this.   The license issuing office can only issue a copy of a Marriage Certificate that has been recorded after the marriage is performed, the clergy person has signed it and then the license is considered a Marriage Certificate after it has been recorded.  I was to be a witness for close friends who thought about using this chapel and wound up witnessing all of the above mentioned problems!!!  Needless to say, this chapel took some of the romance away from my friends who should have had an absolutely blissful weekend in Reno.",2013-11-06 15:56:56

Well guess what they started the day by putting fence post on my property . Then later on I went to ask them not to jamb there digging bar and post hole digger in the ground on my property ,because of my invisible fence for my dog which is marked by white flags, and the foremen told me the white flags were the property line, and I said no the old fence was on the property line. And to also clean up there mess on my property. Later on I heard the foreman talking on the phone to his boss about the neighbor yelling at him about the post bar and post hole digger in the ground. The foreman while on the phone was using profanity calling me names. At 3 o'clock that afternoon when the fence people left, I went to look at there work and notice the fence was on my property.

In chance that the company had changed their ways. However, I've found out the hard way and confirmed the old reviews. This guy is so unorganized and unprofessional. I would not recommend him. 

First off, Upon dropping off my TV to the shop, his shop is so messy and unorganized. Parts and equipment were all over the place. I could barely walk into the shop without stepping over things. 

Secondly, upon inquiring how much to repair my 50""  TV, Hao, the owner, wanted to charge me over $200 in labor costs just to swap out 3 boards (which only took a few screws and a couple of cables to disconnect and reconnect). I determined this by checking out how much parts cost online and subtracting the part cost from his quote.
Bottomline, I was being way over charged for a TV that was about 9 years old at the rate of almost the cost of a new TV.

However, I still wanted to give this company a chance since how I was able to work out an arrangement where I provide the parts and he just does the labor. Saving me $165 in repair costs.

So it was still worth it for me to take a chance on this company, but then it turns out their reviews where spot on. One, it took Hao, the owner, 2 days just to get the new boards installed after I dropped them off. Then, by his own admission, he said if I didn't hear from him on the day I was to pick up the TV, that this would mean everything was good to go and to show up at 3:30pm to pick the TV up.
So I drove to the shop at the designated time, in traffic, as agreed upon, and he wasn't there!!! But what really upset me was that when I got there to pick my TV up, I found out that my TV hadn't even been worked on yet. He had over 2 days to work on it and still no boards where installed. 

Finally, when I got a hold of Hao, he stated he would get the TV done that day and drop it off to my home so I wouldn't have to come back. (A little late for a gesture like that since how I had to drive in traffic just to show up on time.)
In any case, he told me he'd be at my home by 6 pm that day, but he didn't show up until 6:45pm.

So bottomline, I would not use this guy to repair your TV's. He totally lacks professionalism and obviously doesn't know how to organize and plan his time.",2013-07-23 18:28:37

See my separate review of the restaurant. Spoiler, it was fantastic!
Cons;
Not much seating available in the hotel lobby, unless you want to sit in the cocktail bar area, but that was overrun on NYE, so just 2 small chaises near the frigid front doors. Hotel was overrun with children for a hockey event and with children comes lots of noise; not the best ambience for a classy hotel. I saw kids roller skating in the halls and elevators. High decibel screams from the kids in the pool area, made it impossible to relax, although the staff did the bests they could to keep them reined in. I never understand why hotels do not have sound absorbing materials on the ceilings in pool areas. The clothes closet in our room didn't have a stopper, so it slammed loudly with each use. Bathroom in room had a quite low toilet, low tub and the air exhaust in the ceiling was caked with dust. I can't believe that it is ever cleaned, as this much dust looks like years of accumulation. Toilet paper rolls were difficult to reach when seated unless you are a contortionist. All hotel bathrooms suffer from inadequate hooks/bars in the bath. A large blank wall would have benefitted from a towel bar and several hooks. mini-fridge was barely cool. Banging sounds from kids in the room above us were unbelievable loud, but a call to the front desk quickly stopped the noise.
Pros;
Most of the staff (except one cleaner we encountered in the elevator) were very professional and friendly. We got a warm greeting from the assistant front office manager, Helyn De Haan, in the form of a lovely letter congratulating our anniversary and included a bottle of Prosecco on ice. They also offered to confirm we had a room with a great view, which it was, from the 12th floor. Mattresses were firm and perfectly comfortable as we like. Bedding & pillows were all clean as was the entire room. Ample USB charging ports were available around the room. Beautiful wall treatment behind the beds, without any cheesy artwork to distract the peace. Cleaners do not enter daily, only upon request, which is how we prefer. Real hangers were in the closet for use and although there isn't a sundries store in the lobby, they did provide to me a free toothbrush with toothpaste as that was the one item I had forgotten to pack. The shower was quite spacious and powerful. Water temperature was great and the provided lotions were all top notch.
Pool and gym area is well equipped and they offer outside memberships as well. The person at the front desk was so perky and friendly, I want to get a membership just so that I can interact with her again! The indoor pool is quite large and at 4 feet maximum, just the right amount of depth to enjoy and was never over crowded. They also provide a spacious sauna and a separate steam room as well as a huge jacuzzi with a breathtaking view of downtown, the valley and foothills beyond. I definitely understand why this is the premier hotel of Boise, even with its minor quirks.",2022-01-05 02:50:14

Sales was okay in helping find what we where looking for. When we went to drive we encountered a low voltage issue and slides would not retract. I told our sales person I wanted new batteries and would come back to drive. We did drive a similar unit.
Salesman advised us he put  in PDI and they'll take care of our concerns. 
Now the fun , we get a call from the service advisor a few days later. Oops cracked windshield need to order, then rest of our concerns would be addressed. A week later we get to drive. Btw slides worked but no time for real walk around. Salesman said that's a whole different department an person. 
Sent to finance to sign contracts. The finance guy was okay of course pushed the 5 k warranty.
Now closing time so I need to come back for walk around in AM.
The walk-around man was awesome and thorough in all facets of our coach. We developed a list. No where near ready for delivery. Still low voltage issue as batteries dated 2/14 obviously even though showed 12.8 bolts amps and chargeability gone. Old age. Now gauges for propane , black and grey water all bad. Slide pantry is broke equipment with coach originally gone. What did PDI even do??
Head home no RV. After two days call bank void contract. No contact till my wife calls sales manager. Then service calls and says can pick up Monday, it's Friday 5:15pm.
Needless to say In all my 67 years most of them spent in sales, management and customer service, I am at a loss how Lazydays exist here in Tampa.
Perspective buyers be ware stay away from this store. They have no business knowledge or customer service capability. I could tell you more horror from our experience but enough.
Just stay away.
Well phase 2. Finally after discovering our radio  didn't work and front tire cupping along with other issues it was back to service. Our planed trip in jeopardy. After over a week called day B4 trip to check status. Everything but front alignment was ready. So this multi million RV center can't do alignments. Are you believing this???? Okay I'll get done later. Front tire cupping really due to age and weak shocks. At least new front tires, which I had requested since day 1. So one of click on day we are leaving go to pick up.

It's clear the community is receptive to its presence, because when I went on a Friday night, it was PACKED. On a weekend, a 1-2 hour wait is the norm, so be prepared! Bummed they don't take reservations.

I don't drink beer, but I enjoyed the food. The pretzel sticks with beer cheese appetizer was good, and I liked my taco of the day entree - this day was pulled pork, served with fresh chips, guac and salsa. A perfect amount of food! The soft taco shells were incredible.

I drool over the FDR Instagram, so I knew I couldn't skip dessert - so the skillet cookie it was. The flavor of a chocolate chip cookie baked in a cast iron skillet is SO good, and it was topped with ice cream and fudge - sinfully delicious. It was a bit rich, so next time, I'll find someone to split it with me. 

Our group enjoyed our night at Four Day Ray, but there were a number of misses that I hope are fixed next time. This was during Devour Indy, so maybe this was an off night.

*The wait was long, like we knew it could be. One of our friends got there at 5:30 to put our names in, and we weren't seated until about 6:50 - even though they said our table would be ready at 6:30.
*The entrance and brewery side were heavily congested with folks waiting - to the point where it made me a bit claustrophobic and I was wondering what the capacity is...
*For our party of 11, they put together two round tables that formed an edge, so it was a bit awkward - a long rectangular table would've been better.
*The waitress was super sweet and explained the FDR concept to us, as it was our first visit - but she missed me when taking drink orders (maybe due to the aforementioned odd table arrangement) and I had to flag her down to come take my dinner order.
*Getting drinks, apps, dessert, etc. was slow. We were there until 9:30, but it was leisurely and no one was starving for food.
*Our waitress admitted the kitchen's timing was off and profusely apologized. Some people finished their appetizers before others apps were even delivered. Pretzel sticks and desserts were forgotten. The waitress seemed flustered. 
*The space is LOUD. Be warned.

Despite the disappointments, I'm holding out hope that Four Day Ray can learn to handle the large crowds (perhaps allowing reservations would help?). We really did enjoy our experience and the food and plan to come again, with hope that the next visit will be more smooth.",2017-01-30 23:21:31

I guess I read lots of it's-not-as-good-as-it-used-to-be sentiments. Well, yesterday was the first time I visited this restaurant as I was in the area with C (looking at cars in fact so that I may be able to drive here myself some time in the future) and I had previously mentioned to him that I wanted to go to a Vietnamese place on the West Bank so that's what we did while we were out there.

I was trying to figure out whether to try this place or Pho Tau Bay, because, you know, PTB has a cult-ish following. But a friend had told me that she thought this place was better. Well, we were going to try PTB anyway, mostly because it had better Yelp reviews. But they were closed (of course I bother to scan through the reviews but not check which days they are open), so I decided that this is fate's way of sending me to Tan Dinh and we drove half a mile to this place.

We had no problem finding a parking spot, although I do admit that this was a late lunch. I believe we got there at about 1:45. When we went inside we were told we could sit anywhere, and we got the server's attention as soon as we sat down. She was cheerful and friendly and was very patient with us as we explored the menu. She suggested starting off with some spring rolls with charbroiled pork. We took this suggestion and were glad, because they were delicious.

Then I ordered the Pho Bo Dac Biet, C ordered a small Pho Ga and also a rice dish with pork. I forget which kind of pork. He thought the small pho would be small. Haha. We ended up bringing some of the rice dish home.

I am definitely not a pho connoisseur and I hadn't had it in a long time before yesterday, but I thought my pho was pretty good. Of course I put a bunch of hot sauce in because that's how I do it, but yeah, I thought it was pretty tasty. I tried the broth of the pho ga and that was pretty good as well. I was stuffed by the time I was done with my pho that I didn't have any room to try C's rice dish, but he seemed to enjoy it.

Once we were done eating, the service got really slow all of a sudden. Maybe it's cuz our server was helping out in the kitchen (I really liked her), but we had to make an effort to get someone's attention to get a to-go box, but it wasn't a huge issue for me.

Overall, I thought it was a satisfactory visit and I would love to go back to try more items on their big menu. Someone at the table next to us got the rotisserie chicken and that looked really good, and I can't wait to try some of the lemongrass dishes. It'll be like being back in SE Asia.

Lastly, I'm not sure where the 2 dollar signs come from, because the majority of the items on the menu were under $10.",2012-01-27 16:29:08

I've heard a lot about it from friends and finally decided to make a quick stop. I was only going to order a burger and fries but was swayed by the menu.

Let's start with the atmosphere, it's so fun! Very relaxed and unique in its own way. There's a HUGE chalk wall with chalk provided so your kids can play around and draw while you finish up your delicious meal. There's plenty of seating as well as if you want to enjoy the beautiful santa barbara weather outside on the patio. 

The service was great, everyone was really friendly and FAST! We got our order in quickly despite a growing line and received our food in less than 10 minutes while it was still super warm.

What we ordered: The cheesy pig, it had bacon and cheese with garlic aioli and the works. The garlic aioli was AMAZING, I love me some aioli and garlic was great. The bun kind of overcompensates the meat but the meat is so deliciously prepared and feels homemade that it didn't really matter. ($5)
- The jalapeno burger with jalapeno ranch burger was called the mountain climber and it was even tastier! So many flavors including the pepperjack cheese and onion strings made my mouth drool. I only had a bite of this burger and was left craving for more. ($5)
- Fire fries was pretty good but would rather order the regular fries. These came with jalapenos (can you tell that we like our food with a kick?) melted cheese? (very little), and a little bit of onion strings. My friend really enjoyed the onion strings, while I loved the fries. The reason why I would just order regular fries next time is because these fries are the softer, stringy kind and I'm not a huge fan of those so I wouldn't pay the extra buck to make them special, but a girl still needs her fries ahha ($4)
- Lastly, we had the fat guriella milkshake (skinny substitute where ice cream is replaced by fat free yogurt). So it was the skinny fat guriella milkshake, haha a little bit contradictory if you ask me. Oh but this was SO divine. It had peanut butter and chocolate and was one of the best milkshakes I've had in a long time. Definitely try this because it is totally worth it. ($4)

Kyle's kitchen donates a portion of their proceeds to the local individual's with special education and that's very dear to my heart.

We had the axxess card where you buy one get one free and then 10% off meals after. I'm glad we were introduced to this place with the card but would have gladly visited without it and paid the full price! Will be making a trip back VERY soon.

Thanks for the great food!",2015-03-23 01:21:57
zlYiuItn_FnmJSQ3DiUgow,d-4F_GWg2MblmynK_z20ig,NCMTfUJYTasYZ64UuGC-rg,5.0,0,0,0,"The pizza here is pretty good and the price is excellent.

Whenever reviewing a pizza place, I feel the need to state upfront that I don't like cheese.  I always order my pizza without cheese.  That means my pizza experience is different from most people's, and it means I can't speak to the cheese.

That said, the pizza at Poco (as it's known for short by the hip crowd) is pretty solid.  The sauce is good, the meats are good.  The crust is doughy, which I like.  Sometimes it can be a bit too chewy but only a bit.

The main thing that shoots this establishment into the top tier of pizza options is the price.  You can get an extra-large (16-inch) pizza with two toppings for under $12.  That's twelve, count 'em, twelve simoleons.  A dozen.  Not even a baker's dozen.  Actually it's slightly less than that, it's like $11.89 or something including tax.

That is dang cheap.  For comparison, I just went to dominos.com and put together a comparable pizza using their online ordering setup.  It came out to $18 (not including tax!).  Domino's is, of course, known as the baseline for cheap, awful pizza.  When a new establishment pops up that is undercutting the low-price leader by 50%, while providing better quality, it behooves us to take notice.

Now, it's not perfect.  The pizza is good, but it's still basic delivery-quality pizza, not something super gourmet.  It's far better than Domino's, probably in the same league as Rusty's, not as good as Woodstock's.  (It also costs only $12.)  Speaking of delivery, there is none ---  at least, none provided by Poco.  They are trying a very 21st-century business model in which, if you want delivery, you order via Grubhub or the like.  In other words, delivery is handled by third parties, not by the makers of the pizza.

This is, I'm told, the secret to their low-price success: they have cut overhead to the bare minimum, so that they have no staff except the people who actually make the pizza.  (This enables them to charge only $12 for their pizza.)  In keeping with this tres moderne philosophy, there is no phone ordering system, nor is there much of anything in the physical location except people making pizza and eventually handing it to you.  You can only order online or via a touchscreen interface inside the shop.  The online ordering system is simple and smooth.  The interior of the shop is surprisingly nice and welcoming for a place that's oriented solely towards takeout.  There are a few stools to sit on while you wait for your pizza, but trying to dine in would be pushing the limits of the available space.  There are some nice murals and herbs growing in pots on the wall, from which the pizzaiolo occasionally takes fresh basil and the like for use in the pizzas.

Given that minimal storefront experience, there's not much in the way of customer service, but the people there are always friendly as they perform the limited interactions they perform: greeting you, asking the name the order is under, helping people use the touchscreen order interface, and handing you your pizza (which costs only $12).

They also have sandwiches, salads, boba, and a few other odds and ends, but I haven't tried any of that stuff.  What I have tried is their extra large pizza with two topping for $12.

The place is across the street from where I work a couple days a week, so I sometimes pick up a pizza after work (for only $12).  I generally go for some combination of sausage, pepperoni, onions, and bell peppers, all of which have been good.  The pizza is typically ready about 20 minutes after I put in the order.  It is large enough that one pizza typically provides me with dinner for three days --- and did I mention it only costs $12?  My only real complaint (which is a pet peeve I have with many pizza places) is that sometimes the pizza is not fully cut so the pieces tear as you pull them.  But only sometimes.

I'm watching with interest to see how the existence of this place affects the local pizza economy.  It seems to have the potential to shake it up considerably.  Their pizza is substantially better than the big fast-food chains (like Domino's and Pizza Hut) and also substantially cheaper.  I could see them succeeding in a big way.",2019-05-25 22:24:46

I've been to Pomodoro once before, and still think about how good my soup and appetizer were that night. So I suggested this for my mother's birthday. Apparently I am a horrible daughter.

First, we were told they didn't have three of the items on the menu. Ok, fine. Then, after two of us ordered the same salad, our server came back and said this exactly: ""We don't have the pears or stuffed figs your salads, is it ok that we serve them without?"" Um, no? She and/or the chef didn't even bother to suggest adding anything to our salads, or change the price to reflect the shorting of ingredients. No, they just wanted to serve us a dish with two of the main flavor components missing, and it would just be ""ok."" So we took a look at the menu again, and of course while doing so I missed the fact that she took away my bread plate, with a slice of bread still on it, that I had even put some of the spread on. Oops, I guess they can serve me bread but I don't get to eat it either!

Our food came out pretty quickly then-- guess that's the one star. Mom's veal saltimbocca was salty enough for a heart attack, and consisted of two small thin cutlets, yet still managed to be tough and stringy. Brother's wild boar pasta tasted old and the meat was tough with a sort of chewed up texture. My penne with tomatoes, rabe, calamari, and shrimp was the best of the lot, with decent flavors except for the fact that the seafood tasted one day off. Yum, can't wait to see how I feel tomorrow! And sister-in-law's ""jumbo shrimp"" risotto was the crown gem of the night. A huge bowl of rice that tasted like it was cooked in water (no this was not risotto), finely chopped shrimp which also tasted like they were cooked in water, all stirred together with probably a splash of heavy cream (their ""veloute"" sauce) and a few tomatoes and cilantro for garnish. With zero flavor, it looked and tasted far worse than what an amateur home cook would make. At least home cooks can follow recipes to make their food taste right. Simply appalling. 

As we were leaving we overheard a server telling another table they were now out of the caprese salad. Friday night guys, learn how to stock your kitchen. 

Screw you Pomodoro, for making me look like a jerk in front of my family since I told them your food was good. And if you're going to serve me something so terrible, at least be cheap about it.",2011-07-23 01:38:39
RgBttLm84maUEupQL14AAg,PLNgtGnnaCW9vdMAYLNDhg,6_T2xzR74JqGCTPefAD8Tw,5.0,2,0,0,"The interior is pretty cool with different colored dim lighting. The service was great my server knew exactly what each piece of item was and pointed out each one. I got to try the chef sushi tasting and the omakase tasting. 

The chef sushi tasting was good everything tasted great and very fresh. My favorite part of this tasting was probably the chutoro. It was the fattiest piece on the platter. 

For the omakase the first course was the yellowtail with small peaches on the side. This course was kinda like tartare with yellowtail. It also had crunchy bits inside it which gave it a good texture. The peaches on the side were adorable the smallest peaches I ever saw. It had such an interesting texture and flavor. It was very soft and sweet but slightly tart. Most of it was just a big seed inside so you should be careful if you pop the whole thing in our mouth. 

The second course was the thinly sliced bass. The presentation was beautiful and this dish had so many different flavors. The fish lies on top of a sauce which tasted like sesame oil. The fish was really soft and tasted very light. 

The third course was the jack fish which had a thicker and harder texture.  This course came with a mini salad as part of it and the whole thing was very refreshing. This fish in this particular dish was not soft and heavier compared to the other courses which was a nice change of pace in the tasting. 

The fourth course was the white miso marinated black cod. This was probably my favorite course during the omakase. The top of the fish was charred and added that burnt flavor to the dish. The fish itself was probably the most buttery and softest of the other fish courses. It was so buttery that it felt like it was melting in my mouth. 

The fifth course was the skate wing with kimchi. The skate wing was crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside. This wasn't my most favorite course since the edges of the fish seemed a bit hard. The kimchi was refreshing and wasn't the traditional type of kimchi because it wasn't spicy at all. 

The sixth course was the sushi plate course. I think the best piece on the plate was the squid piece surprisingly. I say that because the other pieces were good and tasted like standard tuna and salmon and etc. but the squid was thick and almost creamy when I ate it. It was so creamy it surprised me. 

The seventh and last course was the dessert course which was a Mochi rice pudding. I'm not actually a fan of rice pudding but this dish was very good. The sauce is what really made it for me which was a sweet guava sauce. The rice pudding itself was not too sweet and had thin slices of plum on top. This dessert was refreshing and the texture of the rice pudding was perfect. 

As a person who loves dessert I ordered three more desserts on top of the dessert that comes with the omakase tasting. The people there probably thought I was a crazy person because when the four desserts came they all barely fit on the table. 

One of the three desserts I ordered was the matcha matcha matcha. This dessert was a dark chocolate torte with white chocolate matcha ice cream. This dessert did not skimp out on the matcha as it was full of heavy matcha flavor. The torte was delicious and had multiple layers of matcha in it and the ice cream added on to the matcha flavor. The plate wS sprinkled with like mini chocolates which gave a crunch in every bite. 

The second dessert I ordered was the shiso scented cheesecake. This dessert came with plum gelee and a charred citrus salad with a blood orange Campari sorbet. The sorbet was very refreshing and the charred citrus pieces as well. The citrus pieces almost had a smoked flavor which was very interesting. The cheesecake itself was a plain cheesecake with like a yuzu gelatin on top. The cheesecake was fluffy and yummy and the yuzu gave it a slightly start citrus flavor. This dessert was full of citrus flavors and was very refreshing. 

The dessert was yuzu and currant castella. This dessert came with a blackberry coulis and purple shiso ice cream and cassis cremeux. I think the shiso ice cream was very well paired with the castella as the flavors worked well with each other. The castella was supper fluffy was soft and all the coulis and cassis cremeux sauce gave the dish a nice tangy and sweet flavor. The shiso ice cream was not too sweet had an interesting maybe Tea like flavor. 

Although everything was good here I can't say that it was worth the price. I got the chef sushi tasting and the omakase tasting for lunch and to be quite honest I have had better. But even though I have had better the food here was still very food as well as the service and experience.",2018-02-23 20:15:34

Today, I decided to go since I've recently caught a cold and figured some hearty pho can help me heal. Searched online for a menu and while they do have a website that is up and running it is not running well. There's little to no description of their menu anywhere. Eventually,  I decided to just call in my order hoping to ask a few questions and was met with short , quick non helpful responses. I understand answering the phone while running a restaurant is time consuming ,but I called in at 11:15 exactly 15 mins after they opened and when arrived they had no customers inside. Makes me wonder why they would have someone who doesn't want to answer the calls and the phone.

I asked for the description of one of the rolls listed on the few selections from the online menu IPO roll? Something like that, the description sounded good. A cucumber avocado and spicy tuna roll topped off with spicy salmon. The picture had masago displayed on top, but I figured the chef would add it since that's the way it's shown their website.

A regular beef Pho. And 2 young coconut. He mentioned they are out of coconut and was about to hang up when I asked if they have boba? And he said yes after listing 3 flavors I mentioned I would like the Honey Few. He just said ""okay"" and hung up.

Arriving at the establishment , like I said it was slow. There were no customers and the server a young girl, she has broken English but always friendly and efficient greeted me and as she was checking me out the man who answered the call insisted I ordered 2 Bobas. When I told him no, I wanted 2 young coconuts but since they were out I wanted 1 honey dew melon boba. He just shrugged it off ,but it was a bit off putting. I might have ordered a second boba if he would have given me the chance to order one without regular milk, but he hung up. 

Overall- the sushi was disappointing. The roll itself cost $10 ,but in reality should have been priced cheaper. Very skimpy on the fish and the cucumber had a funky taste. I could also tell the spicy tuna was a bit old since there was a fishy taste all around.

The Pho was great! The beef slices were a bit tough, but the broth was great..... only problem is they are wayyyy too skimpy on the broth.

The Boba was a joke. Not worth it. Over watered down and ( again) skimpy with the tapioca balls.

1) This place is super super strict. They only allow 4 visitors per unit to the pool area. I had 6 friends over and we all quietly hung by the pool for about 15 minutes before security came up and told me to have 2 guests leave!

2) They have silly rules like having to register your bicycle. If you don't register it, they confiscate it. If the tires go low (not just totally flat but low) they'll confiscate it. If it gets ""too dusty"" they confiscate it. And it costs a fee to have the bike retrieved. If you don't retrieve it they sell the bike to an auction.

3) Your guests have to pay to park if staying for more than 2 hours. I invited my sister and parents over for dinner. They stayed a few hours and had to each pay $8 to leave. Embarrassing!!

4) The concierge employees are useless. The Spanish lady is super rude and acts very indifferent.

5) The HOA fee is absurdly high for the square footage of the apartments. And, they do not include everything. 
   A) Brighthouse cable and box, and basic Internet are included. However the signal is being split up so much in this huge building the cable is constantly pixelating, flickering off and on, or just all out freezing and unavailable. This also causes the Internet to be absurdly slow. Only if you upgrade to a faster speed will it help, which of course cost money!
   B) The A/C is NOT entirely included in the HOA. The mass chiller this building uses to cool the coils is covered by the HOA. But if you run your A/C, your individual units air handler does use electricity that you have to pay for.  So in a way, only 50% of the A/C cost is part of the (absurdly high) HOA.

6) The only thing they are not strict on is drug use. Every floor you can walk down the hallway and smell marijuana pouring into the hallways.

7) They allow pets, and other tenants dogs jump on you in the elevator, and pee and poop everywhere and it takes forever to be cleaned up.

8) The elevators are constantly down, or being log jammed by Maintainence personnel using them or people moving in. They messed up not having a utility elevator installed during original construction.

9) 6 times in the last 9 days the hot water is out. 3 of those instances I was coming back from the gym and really needed a shower. This is 2015, and I pay a crazy high HOA. You could atleast warn people that the hot water will be out!!

I will never be back at this dump. Besides the units are beginning to show their age and feel out dated. Luxurious MY ASS!",2015-11-29 18:30:29

Upon arriving at Teddy's Place I was feeling very optimistic about what I was about to experience and checking the 5-Star - Excellent reviews on Yelp gave further validation on what I was in for.  

Though, these sentiments quickly changed as the charades unfolded.  From SUPER SLOW service, to wrong orders, to items being brought out to tables piece meal -- the entire experience was VERY DISORGANIZED.

Upon being seated, we were offered coffee... and were told that a waiter/waitress would be over shortly to take our orders.

5 minutes pass.
10 minutes pass.
Another party (party #1) of people arrive and sit down - and have their order taken immediately.
20 minutes pass!
Party #2 arrives has coffee brought to them.  A waitress approaches my table -- keep in mind we haven't been given menus yet --  but decides to makes a b-line for the table next to me when party #2 was sitting.
Upon taking the orders of party #2, I say ""Excuse me -- we're still waiting for our menus"" to the waitress.
Apparently there was a mix up on who was supposed to be waiting our table -- keep in mind there are no more than 10 small tables total in this place!
Then come to find out that the order that is brought out to Party #2 is the wrong order -- party #2 is now one set of dissatisfied customers.
When our food is finally brought out - after waiting a total of 40 minutes -- it is brought out in piece meal.  Initially, 1/3 of my friend's order comes out -- 10 minutes go by, Then, I get the first half of my order delivered.  The other 1/2 of my order comes 10 minutes later.  My friend get his second 1/3 of his meal brought out to him.  And ultimately, we have to REQUEST the other part of his meal -- the accompanying toast -- apparently it was forgotten or not written down, or whatever.

All in all the food was OK, but the lack of decent service really ruined our experience -- we had such high expectations for this place, but left shaking our heads in disbelief.

We had also overheard other parties complaining about the service and in one case the food.

I came here while on vacation and also this place came as a recommendation from a relative, and if that wasn't enough...it was located right next door to my hotel!!! The planets were all aligned for this trip. I had pulled into my hotel, and was not prepared to get blast chilled right when I got out of the car. It was already a chore to get my bags into the place without getting hypothermia. I was so relieved to see Houlihan's was mere feet from the hotel, I would've gone there even without the recommendation that had been given, to avoid anymore time in the cold.

I was greeted immediately upon my arrival, and was seated with the quickness...no wait, even better cause I was starving. The hostess was real friendly, she seated us an informed us of who our server was as well as the specials for that day. One cool thing, that you don't see on the West Coast, is that at each seat they have a place to hang your coat. It was so nice to have an actual place for it, rather than trying to shove it in the booth next to you. 

The waitress came over and took our order pretty quickly, after we had a few minutes to go over their selection. The one thing that immediately caught my eye was their Stuffed Chicken Breast...a panko breaded chicken stuffed with garlic-herb cream cheese and that is served with choice of veggie and mashed potatoes. This item is a little on the pricey side, $16.95 I believe, but it is so worth it. I also ordered a cup of tomato bisque and some Lettuce Chicken Wraps. 

The soup was good, a tad toooo salty for my liking though. And in the bottom were these weird meatball looking things. I fished them out of the bowl and asked the waitress what they were. Come to find out, they are grilled cheese fritters...parmesan crusted velveeta cheese balls is what they were. They were a nice addition to the soup.

The chicken wraps were especially good, the chicken was tender and had toasted sesame seeds (love those) and this really tasty peanut/ginger sauce to go with them. I loved the cilantro they added to the chicken, it brought out the flavor of the dish and made it pop. It was a perfect portion for a light snack, but a little pricey for what you get at $11+. 

Now for the main attraction...the stuffed chicken breast. The portion size justifies the price, because I was not able to finish but 1/2 of it and barely made a dent in the mashed taters and green beans. The outside of the breast was nice and crunchy, not soggy anywhere, and the chicken breast itself was moist and tender. My only complaint about it was the lack of cream cheese in the middle. I love all things cream cheese, so that was my main motivation for ordering this, but it was lacking severely. Besides my disappointment, the meal itself tasted delicious. The mashed potatoes had this yummy dill butter on them, that had melted down the side and the green beans were steamed to perfection. 

Service was prompt and friendly, the food was good and the restaurant was very clean. A manager was walking around to ensure everyone was enjoying themselves and greeting customers. I would def recommend this place and wish we had one closer.",2015-12-08 20:34:48
Gr4PYEUy1r1tbO7wi4aTqg,7DgEnHjB4IaB2uwp0rcPow,IZ6vx85mSdC2zp0STFzTIw,5.0,0,0,1,"My boyfriend and I decided to try out this restaurant after seeing all rave about it on multiple social media platforms. I stalked their Instagram religiously for a few weeks and pretty much pleaded with my bf to bring me for date night. I'm an avid sushi lover and he's whatever about it, so it took some convincing!

First off, I definitely recommend calling for a reservation. We came in around 9 pm for dinner on a Friday night and there was a nice crowd. Restaurant was a lot smaller than I expected.. Maybe like 5 -6 smaller tables at most? Don't quote me on that, but I just remember the space being small if you're planning to come with a large group. 

I loved the vibe and setting of Luvi. We were immediately greeted when walking in. The lights were dim and gave Luvi more of an intimate vibe rather than the usual nola sushi spots we're used to. We sat at the sushi bar and opted to go with the ""feed me"" option - which is basically different off menu specials for the night, which I loved! Also, ""feed me"" has a raw + non raw option, so we did one of each. 

Chef Hao is some kind of mastermind because I loved everything! This is saying a lot because I'm super critical and very particular when it comes to my food. Everything we tried was so so so good! Each plate has its own distinct flavor, with unique pairings to complement.

This was some of the best sushi/ sashimi I've had in a LONG time. The sashimi was fresh and top quality. All of items were ""simple"" in a sense (no frills and added decorative extras), but nothing short of flavor. Chef Hao did a great job of seasoning everything just right. I could taste all of the different ingredients without one being overbearing. No soy sauce or extras needed. Just trust me on this! *** 

Nothing to complain about on the service - wasn't bad, but also wasn't excellent. A little pricier compared to other known sushi restaurants in the area, but we didnt mind due to the quality of the food. Luvi really blows errryone and their ma'  out the water.  

My bf and I had a nice night, enjoying each other's company and conversing with Chef Hao. He was super friendly and ended up telling us more about his restaurant -- his history, naming of his restaurant after his two daughters, and ultimately the opening of his own business. All in all, our bellies were satisfied and we'll definitely be back!",2019-09-07 23:25:26
clFgOHceCLchbI7jPSef0A,kCBMksMPqNPw2dfWH_deXQ,UboXRwy2UBVH91pAwHiK_w,4.0,1,0,2,"After walking past that giant red grill on the side of the building more times that I can count, I finally made it here to enjoy a meal. Unfortunately, a lot of other people did the same. We had about an hour wait at 7:00 on a nice Saturday evening, but it went by quickly after we were able to grab a beer from the bar and enjoy it outside next to their fireplace. I would highly recommend making a reservation if you don't have the time to spend waiting for a table. 

Outside, you get a significant smell of their charcoal grills, but that really isn't the case inside so you don't have to worry about spending the rest of the night with a charcoal aroma stuck to you. It's a pretty big place, with a few different rooms so it doesn't feel like just a giant open space and I'm sure it helps keep the noise down, as it did seem like a quieter place than I would have expected for that many people. It's definitely a nicer atmosphere than your average restaurant with the dimmed lights and nice décor. The bar has its own room with tables around the outside and a large 3 sided bar with seats all around. The kitchen is opened up to the restaurant, so you can some the food prep over their grills.

It appeared our server was unfortunate enough to get 3 different tables seated all at about the exact same time, so he had to get drinks, appetizers, and entrees out at the same time for every one of them. I think he did a great job and served us with a smile on his face all night. The servers here are also better than your average restaurant, and they will go the extra mile to do the small things that set places like this apart like making recommendation and boxing up your leftovers for you.

Obviously, the whole point of this restaurant is that they cook as much food as they can over charcoal grills. If you like the flavor that charcoal imparts in food, then you will like this. We started with one of the best orders of spinach and artichoke dip that I have had. It was served with a huge amount of warm herbed pita bread, and the dip itself was actually mostly spinach and artichoke instead of the cream cheese goop that most places serve as this appetizer. They also bring out some delicious pretzel rolls with butter before the meal. I went with a big burger that had a whole bunch of delicious toppings, including a healthy dose of goat cheese which I love. The burger was cooked to a great medium inside, but I will probably order it medium rare next time as it had more of a char on the outside from the grill than I would have liked. It came with fries that were pretty good, but nothing to write home about. The food was certainly better than most places I go, but their prices also matched so it wasn't some fantastic deal. 

Overall, I think this place is an average value for the money as far as food and drinks go, but the service that we had that night made it above average overall. I would describe it as the business casual equivalent to the dress code hierarchy.",2014-10-27 22:36:44
iOWNFuxEweeNovgeFyPgVg,UUpGufhutBM0D2mnseQAXw,ve_-rPlEGPClytyJtY55Vw,1.0,2,0,1,"This was probably the worst experience I have ever had in a hotel. Not only was the service horrible, the rooms themselves were quite gross. 

First off, the bathroom. I don't think they cleaned it before letting us go into the room. There was a used towel hanging on the hook. Also, the shower? It was clogged. Five minutes of showering, and it becomes a bath. No joke, the water was up to my mid-calf. We had to call front desk and housekeeping to ask if someone could help fix the issue. After a little more than half an hour, someone came up to take a look. He went inside to take a look and ended up pulling out white thing that was clogging the pipe. However, after he pulled it out, he just LEFT IT ON SIDE OF THE TUB. He didn't even bother throwing it away. The shower head was also a slight problem. The water pressure was way too high, causing it to be difficult to even get into the water without it feeling like you were being pelted with little beads. Not only that, the faucet was shooting water out of the tub and the curtains ended up dripping water all over the bathroom. 

Secondly, the bedroom. The bedsheets were DIRTY. Like weird black and blue spot dirty (on white sheets). The headboard was peeling and flaking off which isn't a huge problem, if one of them hadn't landed on my face when I was sleeping. The pillows and bed were decent, soft but oddly lumpy?

Thirdly, service and atmosphere. In the room, the outside noise of a generator or some sort of machine kept most of us (4 people) up pretty much all night. The only reason some of us slept was because we passed out from exhaustion. Also, the previous bathroom story. However, we didn't suffer as much as my friend's family(5 people). They had sleep with towels covering their face because their neighbors, who had a connecting room to them, were smoking weed in a NON-SMOKING room. This might not seem like a huge deal to some people, but when you have an asthmatic kid, smoke and stuff like that is not the best. When they called security, security just went to that room and knocked on the door, asking, ""Are you ok?"" After that, they just left and did nothing about the smoking. My friend tried to ask if they could switch rooms, they were denied. They ended up pushing towels to the door cracks to try to stop the smoke from entering their room, but the smell still went in. 
The next morning, they went to front desk to talk to either a manager or supervisor, who never they were, they said that they were the person in charge. When my friend brought up the issue about the smoke, the ""supervisor"" said that was not their fault or problem and there was nothing they could do about it. 

All in all, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, especially with the service and hygiene.",2018-12-30 19:24:43
XTIsPJqVV2wXt_O_Eiu_qQ,jWYBlI_RtuVjU6jbDq5fyw,rhe60AwSzlSbYQuTFZ7RkQ,5.0,0,0,1,"Friday night, we were finally able to give Hedge Row a full test. We had been there only for a mid-day snack and that was not enough fully to review. It must be pointed out that Chef Brad Gates is the real deal. He was Union Square's chef de cuisine for 10 years. Also, this restaurant is focused on wood roasting and locally sourcing (to the extent possible). So, for example, some of the veggies came from Silverthorn Farms (one of our favorites). Friday night, we were with four other people and everyone at the table was willing to share. Accordingly, we got lots of different tastes. It was the unanimous judgment of each of us that everything we tasted was excellent! We started with the shrimp hush puppies, wood roasted carrots and wood roasted beets. We had enjoyed the shrimp hush puppies before (on our mid-day snack) and, as before, they were truly delicious. The wood roasting gave the carrots and the beets a lovely flavor. On Chef's recommendation, we moved to the lamb meatballs and each of us enjoyed one. The lamb came from Viking Farms. The flavors in them were extraordinary and were we not saving room for other tastes, we could each have handled more. Next we went to the mains and four were ordered that were shared six ways: the half chicken (Gunthorp Farms), trout (Rushing Waters), salmon (Skuna Bay, Canada) and the pasta with veal bolognese. Jacque Pepin, in a cooking class, had told my spouse that roast chicken is the test for a good chef. It seems so simple, but to do it right is really difficult. Hedge Row DID IT RIGHT! The difficult trick is keeping the breast moist while cooking the thigh fully. Our half chicken was just outstanding. The breast was still moist and not dried out and the dark meat was perfectly cooked. For us, the test on trout is whether the skin is crispy and the trout not overdone. The sauce for the trout included a hint of ginger which gave it an unusual flavor which we all enjoyed. Again, Hedge Row passed with flying colors. The trick on salmon is getting it done enough without overcooking and, once again, the salmon was just done enough. It's accompaniment was Asian in flavor and complemented it very well. It should be noted that with each of these dishes, there is no place to hide mistakes. And there were none that had to be hidden. It is possible that the pasta bolognese is a bit more forgiving, but here the question is the flavor of the veal bolognese (outstanding), the amount of sauce (excellent - not over sauced, a common error) and proper cooking of the pasta. Again, a dish that we all enjoyed. Finally, four of us went off menu for our dessert, ordering either the chocolate or vanilla ice cream and a shot of espresso we could pour over (for our own affagatos). Two of our number ordered the sticky toffee pudding (a mainstay of the lamented R Bistro). The pud was wonderful and our affagatos were just the right, light end to the meal. We paired the first part of the meal with a lovely mid-coast California rose (which was dry and fruit forward). The last half or the meal, I chose a Barbera d'Alba which was a light enough red to go with everything. So our bottom line is whether a restaurant will make our regular rotation. This one definitely is going into the rotation.",2018-04-22 18:17:45

The people inside are very nice and seem to be genuinely friendly and pleasant people. However, for someone who is really busy and needs things available on time, when they are supposed to be available, reliability is a key factor. 

So I dropped off a few work shirts here around 8am on a Tuesday. I just started a fancy new job and don't quite have enough money to buy a ton of quality work clothes, so I rely on the few nice work shirts I currently have to be on constant rotation. They offer next day return if you drop off early enough, so when they offered to have these shirts back to me by Wednesday, I was thrilled. I did not need them by then, so I said Thursday was fine. Now, the hours of this place are more limited than any other dry cleaner I have used in the city. Instead of the normal 7am - 7pm, which Adams Cleaners, Fairmount Cleaners, and my personal favorite, Master Tailor and Clearners, use, this place operates from 8am to 6pm. For someone who works 25-30 minutes outside the city and has to be in the office by 8:30, this is a very tight fit. Also, I definitely don't ever get home before 6pm on weekdays. 

Anyway, with these work shirts supposedly available by Thursday, I had just enough shirts left to make it through the end of the week. I absolutely needed to wear one of these shirts on Friday, but their Thursday guarantee made me feel confident. Since I don't get home before 6pm ever, Friday morning I get dressed with pants, shoes, undershirt, and coat, and walk over to the dry cleaners expecting to put a shirt on while in the car and be good to go. When I walk in Friday morning, my shirts aren't there. The woman at the counter is really nice and apologetic, but that does not change the fact that the shirts were not there a day after they were supposed to be. This was disappointing, but I was late for work, so I had to make do with whatever I had left at home. 

I go back to pick up the shirts the next day, and most are fine. However, my nice white dress shirt, was actually dirtier than when I had dropped it off. It had brown flakes all over it. The woman at the counter thought it was just lint and tried to lint roll it a few times, and the flakes did not come off. So she offered to send it back for more cleaning. Great. I'm not sure what they were, but I have to go back and pick up the shirt still, we'll see how it goes. 

Also, another white shirt I dropped off had that annoying browning around the neck area that white shirts worn by dudes with brown skin tend to get. At Master Tailor and Cleaners in Center City, they have always been able to get these out for me. However, this place returned the shirt with a sign that basically said ""we tried, it didn't work, we don't want to ruin the shirt by trying more."" I guess that's cool, but other places have managed to get the brown out without ruining the shirt, so I don't understand why this place couldn't. 

Also, no offers for a refund or discount or anything for the inconvenience and poor quality. 

So, this place is likely awesome for others, based on the rave reviews. However, I am always weary of places that have to send their stuff out to be cleaned somewhere else, and this is one of those places. Also based on their hours, inability to keep a promised availability date, returning a shirt with more dirt on it than before it was ""cleaned"" and inability to clean a white shirt to the same level others have, this place is not for me.",2013-11-07 15:23:59

She's studying for social work so she was especially intrigued by the Pennsylvania system and the history of this penitentiary. This made her contemplate working in the justice system as a social worker.

It's amazing to see how the space was used within the walls, all the different blocks and how each block reflected the changes and essentially, the decay of the Pennsylvania system.

Honestly there is a lot to learn about and so many fascinating stories. It's easy to see that this place is haunted to reflect on all the misery that occurred here.

Being in the medical field, I enjoyed visiting the ward. I wish we could have seen more of it, but of course most of that block was not safe. The displays and the audio tour provided a lot of insight.

OH did I mention the audio tour? You're provided with a mp3 device that has different narrators guiding you through the penitentiary. They're historians, staff, formers guards/inmates, and oddly enough Seven Buschemi. This site was a potential movie location that he was working on. It didn't pan out, but the former penitentiary left a significant impression on him. So he narrates for part of the tour, which was a bonus.

One other area I enjoyed seeing was Al Capones Cell, if I recall in block 11 (if I'm wrong please message me for correction). There are also art installations in one block, they were interesting to see as well. Oh and the escape tunnell was awesome! Too bad it was sealed up...

Another great experience was visiting the renovated synagogue. It was modest, but fascinating to walk around in. It was one of the few synagogues in the US in a prison.

Last thing I'll bore you with, is the tour on incarceration in America (complete with video). It is a very alarming display talking about incarceration in the US. There is one area where people write confessions (anonymously) and those confessions are put up on a wall. Some of the crimes that people admit to are horrible, but they tell the guilt they carry. We are all human, and we sometimes do bad things, it just highlights how complex we are, rather than the crime we commit or statistic we become.

Honestly I could go on. Dress appropriately for the weather when visiting.",2018-04-04 17:14:15

Now the review. Yes I realize they are just opened but boy the staff is so not trained well enough. The line was longish in the cafe but not as long as the one in DC but the wait was 5 times longer. 5 people in front of us and it took 20 minutes to place an order. 

I was originally going to get takeout and was directed to the restaurant upstairs by the hostess at the door ( very nice decor and aroma up there - I will need to come for brunch next time. ) when I arrived I was told no takeout on Saturday,  hmmm bad training perhaps that the hostess did not know?  So the story begins. 

I returned to the cafe line to begin what would be an eternity to get food. 

The single person ( why not throw another person at the counter??? ) took FOREVER!! She was very pleasant but knew nothing about the food, prices and she struggled to find items in the computer. She had to leave the counter multiple times ( for each order) for help or clarification. I felt bad for her and would blame the management. 

And on to the management. The manger was buzzing around the floor while her staff wandered around dazed and confused. She was sure to align signs just so on the counter in front of these helpless folks. Not once did she step up to open a register or help behind the counter with her confused workers delivering the wrong items. 

There were also plenty of times a worker was just standing around waiting to run food from the kitchen that could have been put to use doing other things I am sure. 

And yes I got the wrong thing. I asked for a donut and they were mislabeled on the counter. I had to direct them to the right one. I guess I should have asked for a job. I felt so bad I wanted to help all the nice folks out. 

Now the food. Very fresh the banana cream donut was to die for. The bagel was fresh and the farm fresh jam amazing. 

Just do not get the bagel toasted. They warn you but it is grilled but it is on the same grill as other foods so it picks up that grilled cheese taste. Not pleasant. Please buy a toaster. 


Bottom line I will come back and give them another try but hope management is better getting this ship righted.",2017-11-19 16:37:27

I have returned as a client after having cancelled my membership several years ago. As a previous member I am aware of how boldly they operate and I was prepared to go in to sign up. I was thankful to be given a free 3 month pass for a friend which I excitedly gave to my family member. However when my family member went in for the consultation to activate it she was discouraged from just using the free pass and was urged into signing up for a membership. I spoke to the consultant myself (Janneka) and she explicitly stated that my family member 'has a lot of issues' and because of all of her 'issues' they cannot really help her unless she signs up for a full membership. I found this really insensitive, desperate and insulting. For this reason I will never recommend any more of my own friends or family to go in for a trial or guest passes. Apart from this issue however I am enjoying the gym.  I signed up for personal training and unlike the other reviewers my experience has been excellent. My trainer (Chelsey) is excellent, always on time and professional. She listens to me and challenges me during every session.  The club is clean and bright and has excellent new equipment and an updated weight circuit. 
A few things that are lacking compared to other gyms are their classes. Being an all female gym they still don't have any Pilates classes and only have 3 or 4 Yoga classes in the entire week. Also they don't have WiFi. Most people nowadays stream their music off of Youtube, Songza or Spotify when working out which is why all other franchise gyms in Edmonton offer free WiFi.  But by far my biggest complaint about Spa Lady and why I am giving only 2 stars is the push to have Guests sign up for a membership.  If they treated the Guests of their clients with more respect I'm sure they would get more referrals. If they did this in conjunction to adding WiFi and improved classes it would be a five star facility no doubt.",2016-01-11 03:16:02

They told me they were running late. I asked, ""why didn't u CALL and let me know this as i don't have all day to be in the front of a computer waiting"".

Wasted my lunch time AND they charged me an OFFICE visit to charge me a CO PAY which i have NEVER paid one for telehealth for the past 2 years but of course, they wanted the co pay for being late and having me wait an hour cause they are so disorganized and the office MGR Refused to waive the co pay and even the DR himself said he will not wave the co pay. Mind u after all this, the DR gave me very Generic answers to my questions instead of just admitting he didn't know. Too proud of his degree to admit he didn't know like 98% of the DR.s out there. This pandemic as given medical facilities an EASY way out with EXCUSES as to them being so disorganized, GREEDY for money more than usual and to give poor customer service which customer service should be number 1, but in todays society it's nonexistent and EVERYONE accepts this.

There was wiring in the front of the dress to keep the shape, so I wanted to take it to someone who was experienced and would do a good job. I was debating between Dorcas's and Angel Custom Tailors, but based on the  number of reviews and the appearance that Dorcas seems to specialize in formal wear, I went with Dorcas.

I went in first thing on a Saturday, and Dorcas herself had me try on the dress and pin everything together. She was very friendly and seemed very professional. Dorcas quoted me at $70 (the dress cost $100) and it was a little more than what I wanted to spend, but I didn't mind as long as it was done right.

I returned the next Saturday to try on the dress. Everything was done except for the bottom hem which worked out because I wanted it to be a little shorter than what she had cut. Dorcas said it would be ready on Tuesday. I told her that I wouldn't be able to come back until the following Saturday as I can't come on a weekday due to work and I don't live nearby; she said that was fine. 

Again, I returned the following Saturday. I went first thing in the morning, and the dress was not ready. I was asked to return later that day, but I had other plans so I would have to come back next Saturday.  However, the  business was planning to be closed the next weekend. I was then told to wait and that they would finish it right now. This was not something I wanted to hear because I didn't want them rushing through it. Nonetheless, I waited as I did not want to come back in two weeks and I did not want my drive out there to be in vain. Dorcas came back out with my dress. The store was too busy for me to try it on and by then,  I had somewhere else I needed to be anyway. 

Upon returning home, I found that my original hanger had been swapped out for a disposable plastic one and there's a small dark stain on the back of the dress. While the alterations were professionally done and the dress fits better than it did than when I first got it, I now have to spend extra time and money to take my dress to the dry cleaners (and hope that nothing goes wrong there).

I can't say ""Yay, I'm a fan,"" and I can't say that I've experienced better as I have never had a formal dress altered before, but I will probably explore other options  the next time I need something altered.",2014-08-09 20:06:25

They were late seating us for our reservation,  not a huge deal. I had a drink at the bar while I waited. The bartender was straight up mean, rude & clearly unhappy. She did not smile once. She was curt & she threw the menu at me & walked away. I sat there for about 10 minutes before she returned. The only time she was prompt was to throw the bill at me. I felt assaulted a little bit....again, not a huge deal. My time with her was brief & I could overlook it as I was excited to have a wonderful meal with my friends. We were seated at the table by an  disingenuous hostess. It seemed as if she was pushing us to hurry. There was no finesses. Again curt, I'm noticing a theme here. We waited at our table for over 15 minutes for our server to arrive to run thru the specials & finally take a drink order. This man was straight up RUDE. Any question we had about the menu was met with an eye roll & an audible puff of his breath. We inquired about the whole fish of the day. It was served 'bone in"". I Asked if they would filet the fish....the servers response was ""we don't DO that here"", he then just walked away. we finally got our drinks & waited another 15 minutes before we could put  our order in. The food came out hot but nothing came out on time. One of my friends was finished eating before I got my meal. When I inquired from my server where my meal was his response was ""the food comes out when it comes out"". The food was ""fine"" in my opinion, colored most likely by my experience. A bit pricey for the portions but it was OK. We finished our meal & were handed the check. We had to ask for dessert which again was met with an eye roll. We ordered dessert but were not offered any coffee. I flagged down a buss boy to bring me some tea. He was actually the only person I encountered who was helpful in my experience here. Mid way through our dessert, the manger came up & practically kicked us out of table because she needed for someone else.

I attended a Yelp Elite event at Topgolf months ago and this event was amazing. They had us up on the third floor, they gave us tons of delicious food, beer, and cocktails, and their amazing instructor really improved my swing. The event was so great I came home and told my husband I wanted my birthday party at Topgolf despite the fact it is extremely expensive. I based my decision on this event I attended and thought ""you get what you pay for."" My birthday party was last Sunday the 28th of October and my loving husband did what I asked. He booked an event for 14 of us costing over $600 for two hours in the bays. We spend $600 for 2 hours and food and drinks. It would have been fine except for the following:
1) Our event was at 4:30 and the email said to arrive 15 minutes early because our ""concierge"" would fetch us to get us set-up- we did and so did our guests but no one came until the event time so 14 of us were crammed in the bar space trying to order drinks when the concierge did arrive and because they had started ordering drinks for a less than accommodating bartender, we started our two hour time slot late and people had to figure out how to find our group.  
2) They took us downstairs to the bottom level. I didn't even know they had a bottom level. I couldn't see the targets and it changed the experience completely. Why do they even have this level? Put the bar and restaurant down there and the bays up above. It really changed the experience. 
3) There was no instructor available. I asked about it and they said the reason we were on the bottom level and no instructor was coming was because of a large sorority and fraternity event taking up the top two levels and all instructors. This event was happening at 6 and my event was 4:30-6:30- so again, why was there no instructor??? This was one of my favorite parts from the Yelp event so this really bummed me out.
4) The food and drinks were so expensive we blew through our food and drink credits within 45 minutes so our guests had to pay their way quite a bit. 
5) The food was not as good as it was at the event and their menu changed. One of my favorite items was the Hot Nashville chicken and it is gone. The food choices are very bland bar bites. 

This was a major disappointment and while I understand they had a large group they would make more money on, they disappointed me and my friends by treating us like we were second fiddle. My husband was not offered anything to compensate us for what we lost. I'm sure the group had fun but we all made comments about the bottom level and I certainly expressed my disappointment about the lack of an instructor.",2018-10-30 13:11:49

Yeah, it was a special night. And yes, I most certainly waited for the special moment to draft this review. 

My obnoxiously attractive, smart, and awesome boyfriend (ahem) took me here to celebrate the momentous occasion of my medical school graduation and uh yeah he's a keeper. But enough about him. This meal was everything I hoped/dreamed/planned/anticipated it would be.

Let's preface this by saying that I, probably like most people who dine at this restaurant who aren't oblivious and or obnoxious, was anticipating the event for all of the days approaching it. Also, being the self proclaimed Philadelphia/generalized food snob/poor person that I am, have been coveting a meal here for some time. It was worth the wait and anticipation in every way.

I honestly didn't want to read too many yelp reviews beforehand because I wanted it to be kind of a special surprise in a way that many of my preplanned and exceedingly researched meals are not.

We walk in at reservation time, waited about 15-20 minutes for our table to be ready, and meanwhile offered (a couple glasses) of complementary sparkling wine. I didn't mind the wait, lets put it that way. Our table right next to the front windows was set far apart from the others-there are not too many seats in this restaurant. 

Crusty bread, appetizers, vegetables with an amazing balsamic cream sauce, house cured olives-this is just the ""before the actual courses come out"" offering. After that, we were both treated to 5-6 different plates each (aka, I ate maybe 11 different dishes that night). Highlights were most definitely some of Vetri classics. They are classics for a reason. Sweet onion crepe is unreal, as is the spinach gnocchi. I appreciated the sweetbreads dish and all of the pasta courses I ended up getting. What a lucky girl I was that night.

The dessert before the dessert as well as the actual dessert were just perfect. And by that point I was way over indulged to even pay attention to what I was eating. Just kidding, that would never happen. 

If you dine here, you are obviously either treating and or being treated by a very important person/business partner/client/special event etc etc etc. Make the splurge and get the fancy wine pairing. Yes, the fancy one. Whatever they're calling that these days. Or, make it even more exciting for you and your date and do one of each wine pairing. Either way. Drink fancy wine, eat ridiculous food, and make sure you have over 3 hours to do-because you don't want to be rushing this one.",2014-01-20 06:08:49

I visited with family and we had a big, round table. I thought service was fine and personable. My wife's parents and grandmother are part of the wine club thing they have at Coopers Hawk, and they seem to think it's a good deal. They get points for the money they spend here on meals, and they get a wine of the month. They talk about this place a lot and are big fans. This was finally my first chance to visit. 

I sampled a few wines in the bar before being seated and then had a flight of reds while at the table. Overall, I think I tried about six or seven different varietals throughout the evening, if only just a sip of a few of them. I want to be clear that I'm not a sommelier or anything, but I am a frequent wine drinker. I really didn't find much distinction between several of the varietals. They offer just about every varietal you can think of, so there were many I didn't try. Everything was drinkable, but nothing was outstanding. 

There's a few other odd things about the wines. First, there are no vintage years on any of their bottles that I saw. There also doesn't seem to be a clear point of origin for their vineyards. They are also very vague about how they are produced. When I asked some questions, they described a process where they ""go out and get the best grapes"" wherever that might be. That seemed to be a very polished response and it's clearly a matter of relativity. Their grapes might be good to very good at times, but there's no way they are ""the best."" The wines didn't have enough complexity for the grapes to be that special, but again everything was very drinkable. So then it seems they bring the grapes to their winery/winemaker and make the stuff on their property (again, no point of origin labeled on the bottle). 

I share this because if you're expecting some knockout wine, you aren't going to find it here, especially if you've got a very refined palette. But for the casual wine drinker, then Coopers Hawk will probably be a great time. The prices of their glasses and bottles is OK; since they're doing the producing, I guess they are cutting out the middle man. As long as it isn't Sunday (stupid Indiana law) then you can buy their wines and take them home at a significantly cheaper price than the menu cost in the restaurant. 

From the food side, I enjoyed it. Not amazing, but definitely above average. Several reviewers have mentioned some of the gimmicky seasonings, crusts, and sauces and I would agree, but I found them all to be tasty. I had the lamb and while the pieces weren't very big they were tasty. 

Since I was with family, I had the treat of not having to pay. Maybe my review or perspective would be different if I had to take that into account. If Coopers Hawk is going to be a splurge for you, you're probably better to splurge somewhere else. But if it won't break your bank, then it's worth your time.",2012-04-02 15:02:55

I had my first appointment on Sunday with Mia and went through 10 dresses and finally landed on one. I had a truly great experience and Mia listened to everything I asked for. This being my first experience shopping for a wedding dress I picked something that I felt safe with, a fit that was something that would hide any insecurities I had about my body. I went extremely safe.

By the time I got home I knew I made a huge mistake. This dress was supposed to be for MY big day. I am supposed to stand out, I am supposed to feel absolutely beautiful with nothing to hide. I couldn't sleep or eat thinking about my decision, I was terrified to reach out to anyone about changing my mind or the regrets I had.

Finally, early Monday morning I called and spoke with Natalie over the phone and spilled my guts to her. She was very sympathetic and told me I could come in that same day and talk through it, try on the dress again and even look at others. When I came in it was full service all the way! Donna, the store manager, met me in the front and we discussed my problems with the dress I picked yesterday, and decided to have me try on some different dresses! They listened to my concerns and didn't make me feel like a lunatic for second guessing my choice from the day before.

Dana compiled a list of all my wants, needs, likes and dislikes about all the dresses I tried on previously and then selected some new ones to try out. I was stunned by her picks, they all perfectly fit my vision! When I finally tried on the new dress, I had my WOW moment! I felt amazing, sexy and most important of all, confident in my body.

Dana and Natalie worked together to exchange my old dress for the new one with no issues and managed to stay below my budget! I could not be any happier!! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!  If you are looking for a place to find your perfect dress don't think even about anywhere else...just go to Bridal Garden already!",2020-09-28 22:22:57

I really want to like this place, but can't because well the service stinks big time.

First time I was here it was empty and I ended up going in the dining area. Service was a little slow, but not too bad. Both my burger and my bfs veggie burger were good so it made me interested to come back, especially because there is the check in offer. I should also mention we were there on a Saturday.

Second time I came with a friend, also a saturday. Very little crowd and yet, the service sucked.  Found out they don't offer their entrees until after 5 because they are supposedly undestaffed during the day and the entree would take double the amount of time to cook. 

We ordered an appetizer and never saw it come until I mentioned something when our meal came out. Our waitress goes "" oh, did you still want that?"" Well, yes, actually I do. So, our hummus comes out 10 minutes later and instead of comp it for us she just uses our check in offer and gives us some lame apology.

Third time I came here, Saturday again. No surprise. Restaurant was emptyish again so I hoped for better service, but never got it. My friends and I ordered the hummus appetizer and I decided I should clarify that it would be coming out before our meal. I flagged our waitress and asked when it would be coming out and her exact words were "" it'll come out when it's done"" ok...not an appropriate answer. I really didn't need her sassy attitude. She even mentioned that she was waitressing many tables, as if that helped her case. She goes out in back and finds it's done and brings it to our table. Everyone was happy with their meals, but thought the service sucked. 

So I'm sure the busboy or waitress overheard us complaining because our waitress came over to say and I quote ""sorry the service was so crappy guys"" bwaha. Seriously? So then she proceeds to take our check in offer and send over our checks. No comped anything again for the sassyness.

Suffice to say, I like the burgers and appetizers, but the waitresses and waiters need to check their attitude at the door. Would have considered 4 or 5 stars if they weren't such douches.",2012-05-20 02:52:54
zvCjuEPAbV0dmHLUFAxGWQ,WX-zf6iIjoUVHk3u7Us7_Q,46_2e1hnQ4csLrYnhn6bkw,3.0,0,0,0,"First visit on a not-so-busy Saturday night.   Three stars, according to Yelp, mean 'A-OK'.  Maybe B minus-OK in my estimation.
Locals will remember past culinary iterations in this space that were just meh.
For starters, the space is handsome but with some kitschy touches that will wear thin over time.  Whetstone has the look of a first post-grad project conceived by a marketing/restaurant design major.
The bar is smaller now when compared to the prior tenant's design, and this is because of the addition of a crudo/cheese station.  This concept is a culinary peeve for me, since ANYONE can pull together an excellent crudo/cheese plate at home for a fraction of the cost.  You can, Blanche.  You can.  

Moving along.

A particular aspect about this place that the current and previous owners keep failing to address is the lack of noise-abating construction materials.  At points, it was too loud with the place only half full.  A particularly chatty threesome ten feet away really drove that point home. 

This city is full of trendy places like this, and Whetstone, like all the rest, unfortunately fails to take the extra steps to create a marginally more quiet dining experience.  Skip this place on weekends if you hate the din as much as I do.

Onward.

My partner had the Caesar Salad, and I had the Whetstone salad, both of which were plentiful and quite good.  Only complaint is that the croutons in both were well past their prime and inedible.  Zero crunch.  Tough as licorice.
My partner had the seared Icelandic cod with clams (6 oz if that matters to you...), and he said it was a four-star dish.
On to my burger, listed as 'Dad's Burger' on the menu.  It was offered as a single patty (about 4-5 oz according to our server), or double patty (about $3 more) of La Frieda beef, which is a well-regarded meat purveyor.
Ok.  I get it.   Americans frequently ruin hamburgers by mashing the heck out of them with a spatula on a barbecue.  And yes, fattier is tastier, and cooking over a barbecue grill unfortunately lets all that unctuous goodness drip through the grill into oblivion.
However, the Dad's Burger, in spite of its carnal pedigree, was just plain drippy bovine bloviation that overwhelmed the meager bun and made me pine for the much-lauded burger at Rouge on Rittenhouse.  
Whatever toppings were on the Dad's Burger just got lost in the muck.  We all know that a proper burger is a thick, gently packed thing of beauty with some juice in evidence.  Not here, however.
I opted for the fries (half salad is also offered), which were just too friggin' salty.  Oversalting is a given here, as much as anywhere else, so no surprise.
I may give Whetstone another try, but there is nothing new going on here.",2015-08-02 03:44:21

The first time we were there a couple of years ago, fantastic, second time, great, third time about a year ago, good but lukewarm food and slow service. After yesterday, NEVER AGAIN.

We get there around 430 on Sunday, 12/28, and sat at one of the tables for two at the left of the entrance.  We order two beers that come in small glasses due to an elevated ABV.  I wish I had known that before ordering them.  

Warning sign number one:  they took our favorite item (a BBQ pulled pork sandwich) off the menu.  Other restaurants do that too before they close down.  In fact, there wasn't much on the menu, so I end up ordering the quesadillas, my wife orders the hamburger, and we order chicken wings as an appetizer.

Time marches on......  We order two more beers, in pint glasses this time, and begin to wonder when the appetizer will show up.  About 45 minutes after ordering, everything shows up at once.  The food was lukewarm and I suspect it had been sitting in the kitchen for a while.  The quesadillas were fast food quality, the portion of the chicken wings were cut by about a third (about 8 pieces for $11), and the hamburger and fries were good, but could have been hotter.  Also, there was ONE bartender to take care of 30+ customers.

Someone else eventually shows up bringing a tray of 4 dishes and sits it on the bar.  We ask him for a check and he eventually brings it.  On our way out, I see the bartender taking the tray up to one of the rooms after it had been sitting on the bar for about 15 minutes.  I doubt that food was even warm by then.

This is a classic penny wise and dollar foolish management philosophy.  You can't have one person tending bar, waiting tables and doing room service.  I would also much rather pay more for a popular item as we are well aware that food costs have gone up.

On the positive side, the Fox and Hound has  a great atmosphere and is well worth stopping in for a drink or two, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one.  The beers are a little pricey ($6.50 and $7.00 each) but that's what you pay for with the atmosphere.  Don't bother with the food and don't even THINK about trying to make a meal out of what is offered on the menu.",2014-12-29 12:57:27
4dDny_6K0Mhly-7LHCl1GA,hqgCVikbzD3tT0w7Z4_xZg,tdCWwSbMXBHomFe1aILUgw,1.0,3,2,2,"It has become clear to me that Comcast's method for dealing with customers' complaints of being overbilled is to agree on the phone to fix the problem and then never actually fix it. Here is my story.

I signed up for a six-month promotion in April 2012. The promotion ended after six months and for month #7 the price of my package increased by $25. No problem there; that was expected. But then, for month #8, the price increased by another $47 -- with no change in service requested or given!

CUSTOMER SERVICE CALL #1: I called customer service and after about 20 minutes, the rep agreed that I had been overcharged. She assured me that my account would be credited appropriately. I thanked her and hung up.

CALL #2: About two weeks later my bill arrived in the mail and I noticed that the credit had not been applied. I thought maybe that paper bill had been generated before my credit was processed so I checked my account online and still, no change. So I called customer service again. Again, the rep, a woman named Ruth, agreed that I had been overcharged. However, the amount to be credited was more than she was authorized to address directly, so she referred my case to Accounts Management. She assured me that the matter would be taken care of and that Accounts Management would call me to confirm that the credit had been authorized. I waited a week and no call came.

CALL #3: So I called customer service again. The rep agreed that I had been overcharged and assured me that a credit would appear on my next bill. (Does anyone see a pattern here?) My next bill came and no credit had been applied.

CALL #4: I called customer service and spoke to a woman named Naomi. Naomi explained to me that Comcast's promotions last six months, and that after six months, another six-month promotion would become active, though the price is typically a little higher - in other words, the price would go up in month #7 and then again in month #13. When I pointed out that my price had actually increased in month #7 and then increased again in month #8, she could not explain it, and eventually ended up agreeing with me that I had been overcharged.

She said she needed to send my account to Revenue Assurance for further review. She promised that she would call me back in a few days to follow up. A week went by and no call came. However, I did receive a letter from Comcast stating that after reviewing my account, they had discovered they had UNDER-billed me for several months and that my rates would increase beginning in the following month!

CALL #5: I called customer service again and asked to speak to someone in Accounts Management. They transferred me to a man named Junior Baez and after speaking for about 45 minutes, Junior agreed that I had been overcharged for several months and said that my account would be credited. When I complained that several other Comcast agents had given me the same guarantee and then failed to follow through, Mr. Baez assured me that he is more reliable than the other agents and that he would take care of it. He said that he would be my ""go-to guy."" He said that he would call me on the phone when the issue was resolved to follow up. I asked him how long it would take to resolve and he said it would be 24-48 hours.  He then guaranteed that even if the matter were not resolved in 48 hours, he would call me to give me an update. Two business days went by (actually four days if but that included a weekend) and no call came! And no, I wasn't surprised at this point. 

Mr. Baez finally did call me back today - the third business day after saying he'd call me after two -  and left a message on my voice mail saying that the matter was resolved and that my account had been credited with $282, which was the proper amount according to my calculations: six months of being overbilled by $47. Finally, it's over, right? WRONG. I checked online to see if my online account actually did reflect this and no, it didn't.

CALL #6: So I called customer service earlier today to confirm that what Mr. Baez said was true. The rep said, ""Yes, we have applied a $149 credit to your account."" I informed the rep that no, the amount to be credited is $282. She reviewed my account and of course, agreed that I had been overcharged and would be due $282. She assured me that the credit would be applied and that she would call me back to confirm. By now, I knew not to trust this line and asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor came on the phone and said that the other agents had been mistaken and that I was only due a credit of $149. However, she offered no reason for this other than to say, ""That is the amount we overcharged you."" There remains no change to my online account, so I have no reason to believe they have any intention of giving me even that smaller amount. 

Clearly, Comcast can afford to cheat its customers of hundreds of dollars and there is essentially no accountability.",2013-05-14 20:41:42

Our first clue should have been when we came in there were only four people in the whole restaurant on a Saturday night. We ordered drinks and they were fine. I got a beet salad for an appetizer - it had goat cheese, red onion, oranges, and olives in it. The olives didn't quite work in the salad. One of the Diners got the deviled eggs, which were fine. Several of us ordered from what they called their flights menu. You could pick three items from a list of tacos, kabobs, and dips or spreads. I ordered a duck taco with blackberry sauce; a chicken kabob with squash, zucchini, curry and cumin; and the bacon date jam with pita bread. The taco was severely under-filled and was lacking in sauce so there wasn't much flavor to it. The chicken had good flavor but it was way overcooked and dry. It was pretty stingy in the squash and zucchini department as well -  just two very thin slices. The bacon date jam was just kind of meh. It wasn't good, it wasn't bad, it just was. There really wasn't even any bacon flavor to it and I'm not sure how that's possible. I don't know how else to describe it. Several other people also got the chicken kabobs and they all said they were dry. We did tell the server and he said he would let the chef know. For dessert it was suggested that we got the lava brownie. Four of us ordered that and one ordered the creme brulee. The server came back and informed us they only had one piece of brownie. Three of us decided to get creme brulee instead and the other person opted not to get dessert. When the server brought the creme brulee out I noticed that the sugar on top that is supposed to be caramelized was very dark. It was in fact burnt. To make matters worse the custard underneath was not even set. It was runny, almost like melted ice cream except that it was hot! We we immediately called our server over and informed him that this was not creme brulee and we were not going to eat it. He agreed with us and said that he knew what creme brulee was supposed to be. While he was talking to us he managed to spill one of the running creme brulees all over my arm and leg. Needless to say I was not happy. He did get a wet towel for me to wipe things up but the damage was done. I happened to have been wearing white pants so now I have a nice burnt sugar stain on them. I am traveling from out of town so I'm hoping that it will come out when I am able to wash them. The server did take off the creme brulee from our bill and he also took off one of the entrees to make up for the dried chicken but he really made no accommodation for the spillage on my clothes. I was just so shocked I didn't even know what to say. Obviously I do not recommend this restaurant at all and would have given it zero stars if possible. Quite frankly from what I saw I don't know how they can stay in business.",2019-06-09 03:33:40

There are 4 buildings. Two walk beautifully designed walk throughs and 2 for the bonus features. Once you purchase your ticket, you'll receive a ""dog tag"" you can register for at the train station or at the little stations to the right of the train. Registering your tag allows you to meet your tour guide/veteran. There are booths throughout the museum where you can listen to your veteran's stories which is pretty cool!

These are each located in separate areas. Both of which have phone stations which more stories from different soldiers' point of view. The exhibits blew me away. They amount of detail throughout the museum is impeccable! They have short clips that play to further explain different battles or the historic timelines, etc. I wish I came earlier so I could've spent more time to really watch all of the clips and documentaries and truly enjoy each exhibit. 

[ [ b e y o n d  a l l  b o u n d a r i e s ] ]
I highly recommend this! Tickets for this documentary are $5 per person. You can buy this when you buy your general admission tickets or at the building where showings are. Just double check on the times! Great documentary narrated by Tom Hanks!

This was pretty cool, but I definitely had higher expectations for this. You get to experience what it was like to work in a submarine.

He also happened to not speak too much English and my boyfriend's partner was super into his station so my boyfriend just stood there for the most part. haha but overall it was an interesting experience.

Went here my 2nd night in New Orleans when in town for business.  Our party of two was seated right at our reservation time, but then we had to wait quite a while for our waiter.  She finally came, and was super nice and sweet (and new we found out).  She took our drink order, and then left us to look over the menu.  We had plenty of time to decide, because the drinks took like what felt like forever.  I think it was at least 10-15 minutes.  That's much too long in my opinion.  She came over a few times to say they were coming, but I guess the bartenders were so backed up they weren't making the waiters drinks.  The place was rather busy, but didn't seem so full that they shouldn't be able to pour a few glasses of wine quicker than they did.  Even though she was new, she was very knowledge about the menu and was able to answer all our questions and give some pointers.  

We started out with a half dozen Jumbo Shrimp ($11).  They were served on an ice platter with cocktail sauce and lemons, and were very jumbo and sweet and good!  You do have to peel them, which is totally fine by me, but I know some people hate having to touch or do anything with their food.  I got the crabmeat maison salad with 
fresh herbs, local greens and country bread croutons.  This was delicious!  The country bread croutons were thinly sliced crostini pieces that came in a cute little container along side the salad plate.  The crabmeat was sweet and there was just the right amount of mayonnaise (not too much) for my liking.  My friend got the roasted beets salad with Bayou blue cheese and spiced pistachios.  She wasn't too impressed.  It was 95% lettuce, and a very few thinly sliced beets on the bottom.  It didn't have anything to make it interesting.  

We ordered a second drink, and it too took forever to come.  We also felt like we waited forever in between courses.  The bottom line was the kitchen and staff were just too busy to get things moving.  The manager was well aware, because she was circling the dining room trying to check in on everyone and make nice since quite a few people were looking around for their food and drinks.  I will say the waitress was super apologetic about it and at least acknowledged that the wait times were rather longer than they should be.

We finally got our main courses, and they were delicious!  On main courses, I'd give this place a 4 out of 5.  I got the shrimp and grits ($22) with delicious little bits of andouille thrown in for good measure.  It was served in a small cast-iron skillet and was piping hot and buttery and good!!!!  I could've eaten a whole giant cast-iron skillet of it!  The andouille was the perfect thing to contrast the buttery shrimp and grits. My friend got the smoked pork shank, Mangalitsa belly & bratwurst, with house-made sauerkraut ($23).  Both of our mouths dropped when this got delivered.  If you've ever been to Germany, this plate was exactly what you get in every bar.  A GIANT pork shank, with tons of other pork products.  It was so big she didn't even know how to start tackling eating it.  The sauerkraut was very interesting.  it was really quite sweet, but both of us liked it.  It was just different than normal sauerkraut.  The pork shank was perfectly smoked and had great flavor and tenderness.  The sausage was also delicious, and of course pork belly is always good.  Talk about a rich dish though.  My goodness!  And talk about seriously large portions...she didnt' even come close to finishing the meal.  I think a table of 3 could've shared this as one entree and been fine.  For reals.  it was big. 


We were so full we couldn't even look at the dessert menu.  We had also been there for so long we were tired and wanted to go home.  I think it was over 2 hours for dinner, which is totally fine when you're in that mood, but neither of us really were.  The timing was very off, but if you're there on a not busy night, I bet you'd love it!  

I also thought the pricing was very good for what you get.  The wines by the glass options were extensive too, and they do them all by the glass or 1/4 or 1/2 carafe.  That was a nice touch.",2012-01-20 02:13:40

During my first visit to Nomad Roman, we sat at the bar during happy hour. The place was completely empty and our bartender/server was friendly. We ordered the $5 Margherita Pizza, the $5 Spicy Sausage Pizza, and each had two glasses of the wine on special. The pizzas were great, the wine was average, and our server continued to be friendly but a little zoned-out. The entire restaurant was almost uncomfortably warm - I assume because of the pizza ovens - but it was really noticeable. As the restaurant became more crowded, our service started to dwindle. 

Our second trip to Nomad Roman was also during happy hour. It was slightly busier, but we were one of four tables when we walked in around 5:30. Again, the restaurant was uncomfortably warm. We took advantage of the Drink Philly special, but it took forever to receive the appetizer and the beer lists were not updated. Four of the draft beers listed had been kicked, and were not replaced - we also weren't told that the kegs were empty until after we had ordered our drinks and waited 10 minutes for our waitress to return with the news.  We ordered our (spicy sausage and margherita) pizzas and different beers, waited 10 minutes for the beers to come, another 15 minutes for the appetizers, and then continued to wait, and wait, and wait for our pizzas. In the meantime, all the tables around us filled up. A waitress, who was clearly unhappy, delivered the exact pizzas we ordered to at least four tables who were seated long after us. Furthermore, our server never came back to check on us, to refill our water jugs, or to ask if we wanted another drink. We couldn't flag her down because she didn't even come back to the area. It was really frustrating, but at least the pizza was delicious. Finally, at 6:50, after Happy Hour had ended, she cheerfully came back and asked us if we would like another drink or if we needed anything. 

While the pizza was good, the poor service will deter me from making Nomad Roman a go-to happy hour spot. The deal here is definitely the $5/$7 pizza rather than the drink deals, and if you want to have more than one beer, order them both the first time your waitress asks, or else you will have missed your opportunity.  I'll definitely frequent Nomad Pizza Co. instead.",2014-06-13 15:52:37

On a recommendation from a staff member from Casa Casale across the street.  We decided to give Buttonwood Grill a try. It's directly across the street from the beginning of Peddler's Village. If you stay at Plough Inn, you don't have to go outside to access the restaurant. 
The Buttonwood Grill is a casual, friendly place that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They have indoor and outdoor seating on their patio when the weather permits. 
When I entered I noticed the staff were all wearing Christmas sweaters and seemed very festive and happy.  I put my name in for a table and was told it would be a 45 minute wait. ( I suggest calling ahead and making a reservation this place gets very busy.)
I took a chance to see if anything was available at the bar. To my luck two people were leaving so I was able to be seated right away. Most of the people around me at the bar were eating and drinking. This place definitely has a cozy feel to it. Wooden tables, nice size bar, and multiple areas. The bartenders were both waiters and mixologists. They have a nice list of IPAs and craft beers on tap. They serve BEERS TO GO. They sell both empty growlers and growlers which can be filled with craft beer to be purchased.
HAPPY HOUR-Monday-Friday 4-6p. There are $5 appetizers, $2 drafts and $5 House wines, and half of well drinks. 
The Buttonwood has a simple limited menu. It's local and seasonal. There are vegetarian,vegan,  gluten free, options and a kids menu . 
This place can accommodate different size groups, but it's difficult during the month of December. It gets extremely packed with holiday shoppers. 
They are truly known for their fresh made daily ground never frozen burgers. 
The bartender Kevin told me they won the best burger in Bucks County for the last 4 years. With a reputation like that I knew I had to try one. I decided to try the SW BORDER BURGER- based on Kevin's recommendation. 
This burger had Queso fresco cheese, sliced tomatoes ""salsa style"",poblano peppers, guacamole, and Chipotle Lime Ranch. 
I must say my burger was really good. The meat was soft and fresh,and I could taste the quality.They use a mixture of chuck, brisket, and short ribs. My burger was cooked perfectly med- rare the way I like it. It was loaded with flavor and had a nice bite to it. My burger was served on a wooden board with natural cut crispy fries and a pickle. You do get a choice for your side besides fries. They serve dill potato salad, coleslaw, fruit salad, a few greens, and for an additional $1.00 sweet potato fries. You can also get bacon on it for $1 and half dollars more. 
My friend chose the ribs with hand cut fries and horseradish coleslaw. This too was enjoyed. 
You can choose your half-pound burger between the Buns or Naked: 
Butcher's Grind
Black bean, Feta & Quinoa Turkey|Salmon|Bison add$2. The Buttonwood serves Appetizers, Soup, Salads, Stone Fired Thin Crust Pizza, Sandwiches, Baby Back Ribs, Salmon, Steak, Meatloaf. Vegetarian Shepard's Pie. 
I highly recommend trying one of their signature burgers and speciality cocktails or beers. 
If I'm ever back in the area I would definitely return..",2018-12-07 07:56:26

As a vegan, I was excited to see several vegetarian options on their menu that could easily be made dairy-free. My first few visits to the restaurant were just okay. The Sweet Serenity tea is amazing, but so are a lot of teas at less pretentious and more inviting restaurants around Indy. Other than that tea, nothing that I ordered was ever outstanding and it was all stuff that I could easily make at home.  For the price, this is a problem. Still, I went back a few times for the tea and a cup of soup or a sandwich.

My last two visits have been horrid. On one occasion, I went in before the lunch rush, around 11, and it was not busy at all. Their Spring menu had just begun, so I asked the waitress if she could point out the vegan items to me, as they were not labeled as such and I didn't want to order a soup with chicken broth or avocado sauce on a sandwich if there might be mayo in it. She looked frustrated and explained that if it's vegan, the word ""vegan"" will be next to it.  I quickly scanned the menu and only saw one item specified in that way, and it was the daily ""vegetarian/vegan soup."" That day, it was a tomato basil soup and, although I wanted a sandwich, I went ahead and ordered it because the waitress seemed uninformed and unaware of the menu. What was brought to me could be best described as marinara sauce. It was so thick and chunky, the only thing I could think to do with it was to take it home and put it on pasta. During this same visit, my water was brought to me shortly after the menu was, and I finished it (they are very small glasses) before I ordered. It was never once refilled, and she didn't check on us enough for me to ask for more (nor do I feel one should have to at a restaurant like this).

I, maybe somewhat foolishly, decided to give Tulip Noir one more chance yesterday. It is close to my sister's work and we were both craving the tea. We went at noon and it was incredibly busy. Our food took awhile to come out, but this was to be expected, judging by the amount of people dining there at the time. We had an average experience with the food and service throughout our meal. 

The real problems came when it was time to pay. We both paid cash and the waitress asked if we needed change. I said I didn't and my sister, very clearly, said, ""I *do* need change."" She could not have been more clear about this. About ten minutes passed, mind you my sister is on her lunch break from work, and we realized we may have been forgotten. Fifteen minutes passed and we saw three other tables receive their change. We were sitting at an awkward table where the wait staff did not have a good view of  us and it was difficult to get their attention. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and kept waiting. Finally, 20 minutes after paying, I was able to flag down our waitress. I explained that my sister was waiting for her change and she looked flustered and rushed back to the register, where she employed another waitress to help her in fixing whatever it was that she had messed up. This went on for 10 more minutes before she returned to the table and stated that they are having problems with the register and asked how much money my sister gave her and if she remembered the cost of her meal. After awkwardly getting that information, she returned to the register and returned 10 minutes later with her change and as she laid it down she simply said, ""here you go."" I was shocked to not hear an apology but then as she was walking off we heard a very muffled, ""sorry about that."" I understand that some people are softspoken but this was  an instance where my sister deserved a sincere apology for the immense inconvenience caused by her error.  This was all resolved 40 minutes after we paid and my sister was over 30 minutes late getting back to work. The ""problem with the register"" seemed like a waitress' error, as many other people paid cash and left in the time we were waiting. The most baffling part is that the owner was there the entire time and never intervened!

We will not be back to this cold and poorly-run restaurant.",2011-08-04 15:20:58

After seeing a show at TPAC last night, my boyfriend and I were famished and on the prowl for grub. Our first choice was Indian on Demonbreun but they close at 9:30pm on Fridays (whaaat?). Next up... Sole Mio! This place has always been recommended to me and based on the reviews of my fellow yelpers, it looked like a hit or miss. ""What've we got to lose?"" I said. We decided to give it a shot.

The valet parking was full so we drove around until we could find street parking. No problem since it was a nice night and both of us like to walk. Upon arriving, the host commented that we'd just missed the theater rush, and he was right. We were one of maybe five parties in the place.

On first impression, the restaurant was a nice size. Lots of tables, good dimly lit ambiance, but not so intimate where I felt I had to whisper. 

For only five occupied tables in the house though, it seemed that service was a tad slow to start. Our waitress was friendly and VERY complimentary, however. (""You have beautiful hair. And beautiful eyes!"" Hello, ego boost.) And after that, it seemed to pick right up.

For me, a glass of Chianti Classico - a new wine on their menu that is surprisingly not bitter or dry for a chianti. Quite delicious, in fact! For him, a Manhattan on the Rocks. Stout, as always (she says not being a whiskey drinker), but noted that this drink was shaken not stirred. And that surprised my boy, for whatever reason.

An incredible fresh Caprese starter with some of the best mozzarella either of us have had. Chicken Marsala for him... which I thought was good, but nothing special. My entree on the other hand was outstanding. Rich, but outstanding. Do yourself a favor and order the Pumpkin Tortelloni with Sage Butter sauce at least once in your life. And don't skimp on the fresh parmesan and ground pepper.

No dessert for either of us, as the bill had already come to $70+ at that point, but they did bring out two adorable biscotti with our check.

So, yes. 3.5 stars for great food and good service, but expensive fare and smallish portions for the price. Will we be back? Eh, maybe... It wasn't terrible by any means, but I'm not sure this would ever become my Italian go-to.",2012-02-04 18:25:27

We fell in love with a couch but were worried that since we have pets, they would damage the fabric. The sales woman raved about how amazing their warranty was. Spill wine? Your kid barfs on it? Dog pees on it? Cat scratches it? Couch gets damaged in a fire? Sure! We will replace or repair. Well I call BS. I just finished the warranty process with safeware, which is a joke, by the way, and they're only offering me $50 per couch cushion because the seam separated on one of them and the others are falling apart after only 1.5 years of use. What a crock. $50 doesn't solve my problem, it doesn't fix my problem. I just want it fixed or the cushions replaced. Also, the receipt says that this is actually Ashley Furniture so I guess don't buy from them either because their stuff just falls apart. The sales woman we worked with lied through her teeth. Lied to our faces. Let's not even begin to discuss how horrible their delivery company was who delivered it. They knocked picture frames off the wall, damaged our railing, left the couch upside down in the middle of our living room with the wrapping still on, did not assemble it or put on the feet. They also didn't have exact change and neither did I, so they conveniently gave themselves a $25 tip that they absolutely didn't deserve. Had they not broke my picture frames and maybe took ten minutes to unwrap the couch and put it right side up, I would've been happy to give them a big tip. To top it off, I was 5 months pregnant at the time and wasn't supposed to lift anything heavy. Would you treat an 80 year old woman the same way? Thank goodness my husband wasn't out of town or I wouldn't have had anywhere to sit for a week. Absolutely the worst customer service of my life. I reported everything to weekends only corporate and never got a response from them. I also called the local store as well. They don't care about their customers. I guess I'll just wait until my senior dogs pass away and buy a new couch from Value City. Until then I'll just have to deal with a damaged couch that they refuse to repair even though they said at time of purchase that they would repair or replace any damage.

While it may be a chain restaurant, this feels like the big league heavy-hitter area location for Pei Wei. I am never disappointed in Cherry Hill Pei Wei whenever I am able to make it over the Bridge from Philly. Frankly, this is the kind of Pei Wei that you should find in a Center City Philadelphia.

I have a tale to tell. It's not hard to determine that I am a relentless fan of Pei Wei. The great thing about chain restaurants are that they often (or should) breed consistency. When you find the food or ambiance that you love, you stick with it no matter which location. When my local Philly City Avenue Pei Wei came along, I loved and visited that place each week until it recently met its devastating demise. It was my happy place for comfort food, drinks, friends, meetings, getaways out of Center City, my reading spot, my home renovations planning spot, and it was 'our spot' with my ex. Hopefully everybody finds a special spot like that, whether it's a chain or not. But it's gone, and thank goodness other Pei Wei locations are left, within a relatively reasonable distance - such as this Cherry Hill location, even though it's impossible for me to visit weekly as I did with my closed one.

When I came here to the Cherry Hill store yesterday, the first time after my home Pei Wei closed on City Avenue, it felt great to feel like there was life left after death. And it was great to be in a Pei Wei that had so much Saturday people energy pulsating through it, especially after the last dying weeks of knowing your special place was on the chopping block and shut its doors on you. I savored every bite of my perfectly done Kung Pao, hoping that the meat would become a part of my own bone, and every sip of Pei Wei's delicious Mandarin Orange Green Tea would energize through me like my own blood. As dramatic as that may sound, I knew it would be worth the $5 Bridge toll to get to this reliable location. I've been to all the local locations, and (as a fan) I consider Cherry Hill here to be the area's flagship Pei Wei. 

I highly recommend that you come here, or to any Pei Wei. If you're a meat-lover like me, you get a great value for the fact that many entrees are based around the meat, rather than around overpriced carbs like many other places. Even if you're not a meat-lover, Pei Wei has so much to offer to make you happy too; with its variance of dishes based on veggies, seafood, and exotic flavors. This is a happy place!

If you find a restaurant like this that you love, embrace it. Fill out the feedback as listed on your receipt - report about your experience, what you loved about the place/food, and what they could do to improve; good restaurants listen. Return to visit often; restaurants face so much competition these days, that it's much too easy to lose your dependable favorites because some shiny new trendy honey-laced crappy thing comes along. Pei Wei is great about offering fresh new flavors. That's what you get here at Cherry Hill, along with your dependable worldwide Pei Wei favorites. If you don't love something enough, it'll be gone.",2017-04-09 15:30:13

Although it's only about 4 miles from my local address in downtown West Chester, there's a plethora of pizza places in that area (not surprising in a college town) and the 4-mile stretch of road gets quite congested, especially around the junction of 202 and 926 where Pizza Peddler is located.  So this is more a pizza joint for the suburbanites of Westtown Township.  It's set far back in a half-empty shopping plaza (that is likewise tricky to get into due to lane dividers and such) so I give them credit for doing a little promotion, otherwise I probably wouldn't have noticed them.  

Although I got my pizza to go, they have a big diner-type sit-down eating space, good for taking the kids to dinner or the office crowd to an inexpensive lunch.  At 5 pm on a weekday it was dead empty in there but I imagine it fills up more on weekends.  

I expected them to try to upsell me something for money along with the free pizza, like ask if I wanted to buy any Cokes or sides to go with it.  But I didn't get any of that, I just gave them the coupon, they handed me the 'za, and right, then, on my way.  Very kind of them. 

The pizza was hot when I got it and stayed hot for the whole 4 mile drive back to my house and continued to be hot through at least the first three slices.  This alone is worth a star because it obviously hadn't been sitting around under the heat lamp before it was placed in my hand, and I have been to other places where I was given cold half-raw doughy pizzas that didn't even sustain their small amount of body heat for a 1/2 mile drive let alone 4.  The pizza tasted decent, although the sauce was a little sweeter than I like and the crust was a little thicker and doughier than I prefer (when the cheese comes loose from the underlying crust then the crust is too thick).  It was still better than Uno's or heaven forbid Papa John's, and did not taste like mall pizza either. It was also nice and greasy rather than dry, and they did not skimp on the cheese. And as much as I liked getting the pizza piping hot, it seemed like the pizza texture improved a bit after it started to cool down - the slices solidified into more of a unitary whole, rather than a piece of hot bread with some melty cheese skating on red sauce on top. 

To sum up, this is a serviceable low-priced pizza establishment that also serves other things like wings and hoagies (though I tend not to order foods other than pizza in a shop with ""pizza"" in the title, just like I don't order pizza at a place with the words ""hoagie,"" ""sub"" or ""deli"" in the title).  Not sure if I would make a special trip out here to get the pizza given that there are at least three other pizza joints within a couple blocks of my house, but if I were in the neighborhood I might eat at Pizza Peddler again, and would consider ordering from there if I needed 10 basic pizzas for work or taking a group out to eat on a budget.",2014-10-01 21:56:29

How much fun could you have in Nashvegas if you like wine and are landlocked? Also as the city keeps growing the cityscape keeps changing. The view alone was wonderful. I was blessed to have free tickets. This day got better and better and it really did. 

The tickets are an acceptable price. Venue was SOLD OUT. People were ready to go and drink some wine at a fair price.  You are drinking wine continuously for the price of a nice bottle for 4 hours. There are VIP tickets, but that is a preference. 1/2 the price more to get in 30 minutes earlier. Bigger glass does not mean larger pour. 

Some people dressed in suits and 4 inch heals and lovely dresses, others dressed in T shirts and flip flops. There was no dress code. 

Volunteers help pour the wine. They are told to pour a certain amount. Accept that fact. The lines can be long, but they move fast. Remember why you are there. Rule of Expectations and perspective. You are drinking wine for 1 price as much as like, maybe not as fast as you prefer. There are a few food vendors. There should be more. Sponsors giving away fun trinkets, love my Crest bag and even a Cigar place. Good for wives who left their husbands home that day. 

This is a rain or shine event,  That being said it RAINED, it rained HARD. The storm felt like it came in fast, however the vendors started packing up before we noticed it. We ended up at at a food tasting vendor, Paying people started helping the vendors hold their tents down. In our tent there were 8 people helping hold down the tent. We got soaked.  

We looked at the rest of the tents and the same occurance was repeated. People helping others. Kinda like the flood but with wine. I WAS in the flood it was awful, but people's good nature come out during crazy weather.  It was not ideal situation, yet it was a crazy fun experience. Sadly, we were not in a tent with wine, so as in commrades in agony, we did have that to fall back on for 20 minutes.  Went to help another tent, this time a beer tent. We don't like beer, they were fine. Went to wine tent, FINALLY, yet, NO more wine there. Went to a whiskey tent. Our labor for helping the food guy with no thanks was rewarded. 

Sun came out, wine back on pour and were ready for another hour of tasting. Really fun and unusual event.  We laughed for 4 hours. GREAT Day!",2016-09-11 17:29:15

We were recommended this hotel by my aunt who was blocked off a ""row"" of rooms about 6 months in advance for my cousins wedding. 
I didn't have the best experience with the hotel staff as I was trying to extend my stay one night. I was told ""They don't handle scheduling"", which is fine. They would then transfer me to the call service where I would sit on the phone for an hour (no exaggeration) just to have them say I can't find your hotel room reservation there's nothing I can do. 
After doing this twice and wasting 2 hours I finally got a hold of someone at the hotel, Kelly, who helped me out. She was sweet to me. Unfortunately my Aunt did not have a great experience with her and received a bug attitude. 

Moving on we have a great time at the wedding and return that night. A friend of the family has her teenage son out in the lobby with her at about 10 pm. The bartender Dante, comes to her in an aggressive demeaning tone and literally said ""there is no reason you should have your child out past ten. This is adult time he needs to be in your hotel room"". Mind you there is no policy stating this. The only sign in the hotel room says, ""All minors under 18 must be accompanied by an adult"". That's it. This wasn't the only person we saw this happen to. There was another guest who was yelled at for having her son on the patio. He treated her like shit as well. 

Next problem, we were sitting on the patio and Dante comes to me and says ""lady we are not allowed to have a six pack or any outside drinks in the hotel"". First of all it's a patio of the hotel... not a restaurant... a patio at a damn hotel. Second there are no policy's here saying this? If there was a posted sign no problem we get out of here. 

There's more to it but I'm just over talking about it. 

These are just a couple events that really tainted our experience with this Hyatt. 

Dante was the biggest problem. His attitude was absolutely unacceptable and unprofessional. I am so pissed about this. I wish I would have listened to reviews before agreeing to WASTE my money here.",2021-05-23 02:23:21

Located right across from the ballpark, it is a fantastic spot to gather before or after games, for events, or even if you just want a nice pub-night.

What stands out most about Mellow Fellow is the beer, specifically in how extensive their selection is.  With literally dozens of brews on tap, running through just about every style, along with fridge cases full of cans and bottles, I am pretty sure the building itself is somehow floating on vast reservoirs of beer secretly stored below ground.  With selections of wine, cider and spirits to boot, you are sure to find something great and delicious to try out.  Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for their drink specials, which change daily.

Now, for the food, I hesitate to call it elevated pub food, because they have really worked to take the familiar favorites to entirely new levels, and are very creative in what they serve up.  The menu is changing all the time.  I stop by maybe every few months, and each time there are some new dishes added and older ones taken off, which really piques my interest in trying their newer offerings.  As far as appetizers go, the pretzel is pretty good choice, and they make a pretty darn good French Onion Soup, too.  The flatbreads are great, especially the curry one, and if you want something lighter to start off with they do a fantastic cheese board appetizer.  The burgers here are excellent, but I usually go for some of their more fanciful dishes.  Tonight I ended up with the Oaxaca Poutine, which turned out to be a seriously amazing mash up of food styles from our neighboring countries to the north and south.  Large cut fries covered in mole sauce, pulled turkey, guacamole and crema.  This is seriously delicious stuff.

There are plenty of tables and spaces at the bar, as well as some spaces on the patio around the fire pit.  But this place being so popular, it can fill up with a lot of thirsty customers.  Prices are pretty reasonable, though not the cheapest drinks or pub food in town, certainly.  The service here has almost always been very friendly and prompt, though with occasional lags on especially busy nights.  Parking is provided by the garage in the same building, and is usually pretty easy to get in and out of, though if there is some event going on downtown it fills up pretty fast.

All in all, this is a really great pub that I really enjoy stopping into.  Would definitely recommend anyone downtown hunting for a watering hole to check them out.",2018-03-18 14:31:23

During the tour, we heard a ghost story about the City Tavern and were intrigued. That's probably part of the tourist-trappiness of this place.

All that aside, the food was OK. I had the fried tofu, even though it was only the second time I'd had tofu. It was good; the portion was huge (it had veggies and linguine too.) The tomatoes were tasty, but the rest was pretty bland. I only ordered it because it sounded so strange and unique and was apparently a recipe that Ben Franklin received in the letter (I still need some convincing on that point...) Boyfriend had the NY Strip Steak/shrimp. He seemed underwhelmed by it and said it was all pretty bland tasting. We skipped dessert, figuring it wasn't worth it.

I think what really left a bad taste in our mouths (HA!) was the service and ambiance. Don't get me wrong; the restaurant is beautiful and looks like an old house. We had the unfortunate experience of being seated in the same room as a group of people who were very loud and talking about suicide...nice dinner conversation, huh? Naturally, this is not the fault of City Tavern, but it did kill the mood a little bit (no pun intended.)

The servers are dressed in colonial garb, which is cute if a little mortifying for them. Our server was a little brusque and kind of seemed like he was hating his life (possibly due to costuming requirements? who knows...) The guy who brought around water was nice but spilled it a little bit on my foot (but I can forgive that; these things happen.) The pumpkin pecan biscuits were actually very good, as was the brownish bread (the white bread was pretty dry and tasteless.) I guess our waiter just had a very dry (like the bread) sense of humor--when I said I was ordering the tofu, he was like, ""Oh, is that the only thing on the menu you can eat?"" and I replied, ""No, I'm not a vegetarian, but it looked interesting."" It was off-putting.  He seemed put off that we didn't order wine (which was priced up to $4,999/bottle...uh, no thanks) and dessert. The host standing in the front hall was adorable and friendly, so no complaints there.

Am I glad we went and checked it out? Sure. Did I see any ghosts? Nah. Would we go back? Probably not. The turkey pot pie is tempting, but I can find that elsewhere.

I will say that I've heard great things from people who had their wedding reception there, and it seems like a cool venue. Apparently the ghost pops into the pictures of the bride and groom. My aunt got married there so I'm going to get her to check out her wedding pics and see if there are any uninvited guests in the background.",2012-05-29 16:35:32

We stopped into the ""Stone soup Company"" after reviewing their menu online and liking what we saw. As soon as we walked in, the whole place was cool and different! Local artwork adorning the walls, very comfortable booths, and people not packed on top of each other. Jessica was our server, and fantastic doesn't even describe how great she was. She heard us calling our son by his first name and so did she! She never asked his name, she just organically started calling him by his first name, she had great table interaction with all 3 of us, and she was extremely personable. When I asked her about certain dishes she gave me her personal thoughts on them which is very important to me. Nothing worse than asking ""what's your favorite dish here?"" And a server shrugs and says....... ""I don't eat here"" She came back to check on us, and never left a glass dry. .

The food:

The menu has all sort of different things on it, literally it was hard to choose with all the delicious choices. We settled on the hummus appetizer, Greek salad with chicken, an Italian panini, and a chicken tender basket for our son. The hummus, came with heaps of pita bread, cucumbers, and tomatoes to dip. It was very tasty and vegetables were fresh and crisp, I really enjoyed this app because they added a little chopped garlic onions and olives to it. Very versatile and delicious! The Greek salad was one of the best Greek salads I've ever had. Originally it came with a ""house made Greek dressing"" that looked like ranch. I asked Jessica ""can I have some Greek dressing, it looks like this may be ranch."" She informed me that that was their creamy Greek dressing, and it was incredible.  It was!!!! That was literally the best salad dressing I've ever had on a Greek salad, I wished they bottled the stuff! The salad was full of Crisp lettuce and vegetables, plenty of Feta and the Chicken was cooked perfectly with a Mediterranean seasoning, absolutely perfect and delicious! My wife's panini was very good as well, she offered me a bite of it and it was very tasty. Plenty of meat and cheese, Bread was crispy and perfect! Their fries were on point! Cooked crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My son's chicken tender basket was good as well! Three large high quality tenders cooked to perfection. Not overdone, and very soft and juicy, he loved them, and for a 2 year old to devour chicken tenders,That's saying something! All in all it was an incredible lunch, and we will for sure be back! Thank you Jessica! And if the new hire that was shadowing you, follows all your steps she will be amazing as well! Stone soup Company rocks!!!",2021-04-30 16:10:26
c2Avsp2s1aDyQSGMCQl8zg,uxUsDVzeyqp5wCuVdk1mBw,u1aG60BpBh9CjuqT1_cWaw,2.0,4,4,1,"Giovanni's is a decent little italian place.  The food is good, not  ""knock your socks off"" good, but good.  There are a few things I think they could improve to make me come back more often.

1.  Menu:  The menu is nice and large, full of choices.  At the same time there is not much flexibility in substituting sides.  Waitresses have been pretty rigid.  The variety also means that the quality of the food coming out sometimes suffers as it is apparent that the kitchen sometimes struggles with consistency.  I believe they would benefit from perhaps focusing the menu a bit.

2.  Price:  Yes, I realize they give you big portions.  However, I'd prefer smaller portions and more manageable prices.  We always drop waaaaay more money at Giovanni's than I would care to drop at a family-style italian restaurant that sits on 724.  This most definitely keeps us from going to/ordering through Giovanni's as often as we might.  So focus the menu and portions and prices.

3.  Wait staff:  I believe we've dined in with Giovanni's 3 or 4 times.  I'd say 3 out of the 4 times we were sort of put off by the waitresses.  They did not come off as friendly or accommodating for what most restaurants would consider simple substitutions.  In fact, I can't think of any other place that has ever denied us switching one side out for another side.  Our last experience was pretty bad, we had a large party and the waitress told us she had another large party waiting.  We had people at the table who had clearly not finished their meals when she told us this.  So then we felt rushed (and the section where our table was had nobody else in it, it's not like the restaurant was packed).  File this under how not to get a good tip.  Less than 5 minutes later, she came back looking to take more stuff and she literally just stood by the table staring at us.  It was ridiculously uncomfortable.  We weren't just sitting around doing nothing, we were finishing our meals!  I can tell you, that experience is going to keep us from dining in there for quite a while.

4.  Accuracy:  On carry out, I've been burned multiple times when they either gave us the wrong thing or forgot to give us something.  After the 3rd time that happened, we just check the order before leaving.  I just wish we could trust that they'll get it right.  These sort of things can either be mistakes (which are fine, but don't make a habit of it) or indications that there are bigger things being missed inside the restaurant.  If you take pride in your job, you'll care about getting the order right.  If you don't, then I have reason to believe much more is not handled with care.  

So whenever someone says ""should we go to Giovanni's?"" it's a little risky.  Yes, we'll get good food, but not good enough to put up with the cost and the inconsistent service.  I want to like this place, which is why we keep going back.  I hope some of these things can at some point change.  Until then, it is a mid-range fallback option when we are pressed for time and don't want to drive up 100.",2014-09-25 15:22:44
87Tp-KLLqu8bZjk7YUuNaA,jzuhoslq-DwUp09KD5dO4Q,6YDFyqt5RsMTIekfK4UW-w,4.0,5,3,2,"I got my first introduction to the lovely crime scene of New Orleans 5 days before Christmas when some lovely person decided to smash my front passenger window in and steal a bunch of stuff out of my car while it was parked at a relatively busy intersection downtown. Not cool. I called my insurance company the next morning only to find out they weren't going to cover the repairs, so I was left on my own to get the window fixed before I left town in a few days. Happy holidays, folks.

Accurate Auto Glass quoted me $75 less than Safelite did, and offered to send some one to my house. I needed the window fixed before they could get here, so the helpful lady over the phone said if I could take my car to them first thing the next day, they would be able to fix it a little sooner. Consider it done.

I got to the shop a little before 8am, and sat in the very cozy waiting area, which is nothing more than a couple chairs about 10 feet from the receptionist's desk. It looked like they were having their office holiday party that day because people kept coming in with presents and food and disappearing in to some back room. There were also 3 little boys (3 years old-ish) running around in their jammies, so it definitely seems like a pretty family oriented place. 

After about an hour, a lady comes out and tells me that they can't actually fix my window right now because they don't have the right replacement like she thought, but she could get the right part in from Baton Rouge that afternoon. I was already late for work at this point, so I was starting to get a little upset, but she quickly went on to say that her guy would tape up my window properly (what, she didn't like the black, non-transparent trash bag thing I had going?!) and they would come to my office to fix it. That was slightly inconvenient since I work downtown and park in a parking garage a few blocks from my office, but at this point I had no time to be picky.  

The repairman called me when he was about 5 minutes away so I snuck out for a few minutes and met him at my car. He was really friendly and apologetic about the morning, and had the window fixed in about an hour and a half. Plus, he completely vacuumed my car and cleaned up all of the broken glasses that I was still riding around with. The window seems to work properly- I've only rolled it down once, but it went right back up so that's a good sign. And I think I got a lifetime guarantee on the window as well, so that's a plus. 

I'm glad I got such a good deal, and that I could support a local business instead of the overpriced nation glass company.",2012-01-05 02:19:30
vkF0q4Hp6Jshsu-1kjme1w,xq2DXxeIiYsnypP6qj8Fgw,3cGOER5FLbVyw7ZTnWG77A,5.0,2,1,2,"I recently moved back to Reno, after living in Las Vegas for two years, and had an enormous shock when the first snow storm of the year hit.  I haven't had to bring out my winter clothes in so long, that after I started to pull them out of a storage bin I have had them in for the last two and a half years, I realized the majority of them didn't fit anymore or were way out of style.  So after taking them down to the local Goodwill, it was time to update my winter fashion that consisted of only sweats and sweatshirts with UGG boots.  Not cute.

 Being in this much smaller town, I knew my selection of stores would be very limited.  Forever 21, Kohl's, Macy's, Dillards...  I remembered all the stores that were here when I first left for Las Vegas, and none of them sounded that great to me.  I hate going into stores like Forever 21 because I feel like it is a complete shit show in there.  The clothes are all over the place, it's like tussling through a garbage bin, you can never find anything, and by the end of it you are annoyed, and the excitement of buying new clothes becomes a hassle.  

Randomly, I went into Meadowood Mall, to get my boyfriend a ninja turtle mug from Spencer's, and saw that little old Reno had an H&M store.  I was extremely excited because this was one of my favorite stores to shop at in Las Vegas, not only because I loved the style of clothes, but it was also located in Town Square which is a local hot spot I frequented.  The clothes were also always in a very good price range, not too cheap that they were going to fall apart, and not too expensive that you could only buy one thing when you went in there.

 The outside of the store was all windows looking into beautiful and clean display racks.  There was an entrance coming from the main hallway of the mall and also an entrance going into the Men's H&M.  Everything was against white walls and flooring, which made the clothes stand out.  The bright lights against the white walls made the store feel clean and organized.  Just by some of the clothes on the display racks, I knew I was going to do some damage in there.  

 I walked in from the main hallway and was automatically greeted with a smiling face from one of the many beautiful girls that worked there.  It was on a Wednesday afternoon and the store wasn't very busy, which I really enjoyed because I hate trying to move around a bunch of people while trying to shop.  I started to stroll around the store and all the clothes were hung perfectly on their hangers, where they belonged.  The store was extremely organized.  I really enjoyed being in H&M, and it made me feel like I didn't have to toss through bins to find some amazing clothes.  Everything was set up conveniently. 

 The store was completely decorated with season appropriate clothing, and had a lot of designs to choose from.  As soon as I started pulling clothes from the racks, one of the girls working there came over and offered to start me a room to try on the clothes I had picked out.  She was on top of it too, I never had more than three things in my hand by the time she would come by to take them to the room. 

 After I finished picking out all the clothes I liked, I went back to the changing rooms.  The sales lady had hung up all the clothes I had picked out and offered to grab me different sizes if I needed it.  The changing rooms where nicely sized, and had the same bright lights in them with a large mirror hanging on the wall.  While I was trying on all the clothes the sales lady came by and asked if I was doing okay, which was nice.  She took the clothes that I had started to hang on the ""no"" hanger, which gave me more room in the changing room.  After I was done trying on everything, she even grabbed all the clothes and walked them to the check-out counter for me. 

 I did pick out a lot of clothing and was a little worried with how much my final total was going to come out to.  I spent a little over $400 and left with two large bags full of new winter clothes.  I was very happy overall with the experience I had at H&M.  The cleanliness and organization of the store, the helpful sales girl working, and the styles and prices of the clothing will make me a repeat customer.",2013-12-12 19:10:57
TVfTFgH7XlSkOTtn397ArA,7D2YYH5yQZRMhmpBcYZUSg,yHg5PkXbrY9lHnFSBe-haA,4.0,0,0,0,"So, here's the thing.  I have been going here for years.  I have had a lot of good things there over the years and my wife and I have brought others to the place to enjoy a summer night or a long lunch or a post-movie conversation.  Today we went just to have a coffee together.  I needed a light lunch and she a mid-day snack.  Today both were superb.

Recently they have added to their menu and it seems the theme has been preserved.  Today the soup was onion & pork bits.  My wife had a croissant with a little jam.  Both were ordered up with their excellent Canadesé coffee.

Often we are content to have a lovely gelato, their very capable tiramisu, or a brownie.  We have enjoyed a few of the pizza offerings (mostly because my better half loves a thin crust creation of almost any kind) on occasion.

On this visit my wife exclaimed more than twice how fantastic her croissant was.  But I did not speak much because my spoon kept returning to the bowl of soup in an unstoppable enjoyment.  I am not always trusting of a staff recommendation, so I was more than a little delighted when the soup was still delivering great taste even after the crusty bread crotons were getting soft.

There were plenty of staff available on this Saturday and the kitchen was producing at a steady and speedy clip even at this early afternoon period.

As much as I took some amusement at my realization that most everyone seated and working there was born after the release of the Bowie album playing on their sound system, it is still one of the only annoying things about spending time at Leva.  Things have improved in this department greatly since the renovations, and the current system is much less distorted, but the levels at which they keep the ""atmospheric music"" are higher than I enjoy (no matter what is playing) and attribute this to the higher noise levels of the coffee machinery which staff are closer to.  From behind the counter I am sure the levels seem right, but I can only recall one visit where I felt they had the levels right and it was when they had a small stereo system perched on the serving counter during renovations.  Overly ""foreground"" music aside all of the other benefits of the coffee bar keep bringing us back.  And on this occasion it was a truly remarkable light lunch.  The removal of the big displays behind the counter is also a welcome change.  I see improvement all the time and continue to go there for what has consistently been a great coffee and snack.",2012-10-27 21:03:52
UzSbjT9KjQlD8EQAxN8Bzw,CwLo2ug_ue5zMUQKyswZRQ,XnTBpbgnH0jKolelADeryQ,3.0,0,0,0,"Hotel is nice but not excellent, amenities are actually not up to par with most hotels of this star rating. I usually stay at Hotel Monteleone or The Roosevelt but received an offer to try NOPSI and I can't say I was impressed. My room walls were scuffed and dirty, a simple cleaning with a magic eraser would have eliminated these blemishes and for a 2 and a half year old hotel to have these markings is really just a sign of poor upkeep. I did not experience any housekeeping issues others have mentioned, my room was cleaned and replenished every day. But two major issues did happen during my stay. One - the reason for my stay was my 40th birthday, my boyfriend had called a week prior to our arrival to request champagne and strawberries when we arrived. After checking in there was nothing in the room. Since my birthday was the next day my boyfriend waited to see if they were just arriving late. Nope, nothing. So he had to leave to go downstairs to speak to someone. The very polite concierge informed my boyfriend she received no request. She was very apologetic and made it right but the fact that this request was lost or forgotten and my boyfriend had go through the process all over again because someone dropped the ball is really inexcusable for a hotel that's trying to compete with some pretty big hotels in the area that are customer experience oriented big names in the industry. Second - we checked out and left my boyfriend's cashmere sweater hanging in the closet. I called that day to advise and inquire how I could have it sent to me and the hotel uses this completely asinine and useless service that you have to fill out a missing form online through a third party company. 2 days later and I am still waiting for a reply. This is beyond unacceptable, I called the same day and was offered no help whatsoever other than a ""sorry"" and a link to fill out a lost and found form. This isn't for a lost phone charger or hairbrush, this is a $200 sweater and no one at the hotel will help at all and this third party company has still not responded to my claim in over 2 days!!! A google search of the company shows they are a 1 star rating with multiple reviews stating lost items never retrieved/returned. Definitely a scam! Will definitely never return to NOPSI, for a little more money will return to the Roosevelt.  While the rooms are a little more dated the customer service and amenities are truly top notch 5 stars.",2019-12-17 07:33:02

We went here last Sat for 2 special events in one, our aunt & uncle's 55th wedding anniversary and my mother-in-law's 70th birthday. We had reservations for 7pm and were seated right at 7pm. Sad to say, from there is was down hill.

The resteraunt was full. We sat and were not spoken to until 15 or 20 minutes later...to ask what we'd like to drink. It didn't take us but a minute to decide and the lady left. We didn't see her for another 10 minutes. She apologized and said they were short a bar maid. Ok. Well, when she poured the wine my aunt thought she was going to wear the wine. It was almost like she was filling beer cups at a football game concession stand, fast and sloppy.

Then, another 10 minutes or so goes by when a man finally comes to take our order. He said he would bring us some dinner bread after he put the order in. Ok, that didn't make it to the table.  So, we drank our drinks slowly waiting on our salads. This was another 15 minutes waiting when we finally had to catch the waiter and ask where at least the salads were. He asked ""Oh, you want me to speed this up?"" That was the funniest thing I've ever been asked at a resteraunt.   Really? You have to ask us that (is what I thought)? So, I politely said yes, please, that would be nice.  Before he could leave the table, my husband reminded him about the bread. Amazing!  It took 1 hour from being seated just to get the bread they offered and the small dinner salads we ordered Geez! So, we're at 8pm now.

Finally, dinner came. By this point I stopped looking at the clock because it was ruining the dinner with family for me. I ordered the Mariana Trout. Not terrible, but not worth the $17 charged and no sides. Absolutely no flavor, not even salt or pepper. It didn't look like local fresh fish, maybe something from Sysco. Either way, the only flavoring was about 1/2 stick of melted butter, olive oil, some sautéed onions and mushrooms and artichoke hearts. However, 3 others in our dinner party had the Veal Payton.  They said it was very good. The 5th person in our group had the Osso Buco. He said it was very good. 

Sadly, while we were eating, there was a large table of very loud obnoxious drunks nearby. They were making everyone in the resteraunt mad. The owner was walking around a lot, but did nothing about it. It was not until almost every table complained that the waiter closed off that room to give everyone else a pleasant dinner.

Finally, desert. We ordered the parfait. It came out in a wine glass...very frozen ice cream, liquor and whipped cream. Once it melted a bit to be soft, it was very good.

The best service we got all nightwas from the bus boy. He was on the ball clearing empty dishes and glasses. If he keeps that work ethic up he will make good tips as a waiter one day.

Before leaving, after about 5 glasses of water (waiting on the meal) and 2 glasses of wine, I had to visit the lady's room. When I walked in there was someone waiting in line behind the door...as there is not much room. I apologized for almost hitting her. She laughed and understood the situation. While waiting I looked up and saw there was still Christmas decorations on the lights...in February.  OMG. Then, I glanced over and saw the vent. Ugh, if a flea could get though the funk on it I'd be surprised.  The floor aroundthe toilet was wet...not sure from where amd didn't want to know.

I won't get into the decor. That would take more time than I'm sure you want to read...considering how long this is already. 

We finally left about 9:30pm. That was crazy!

You know, this was only the 2nd time I've been here in 2 years and both times the service was terrible. Theu have been in business more than 20 years. You'd think they would have this down pat by now. My husband and I have no plans on returning...of the list.",2017-02-16 21:51:10

Let me start by saying I have bought 2003, and 2007, Sonata's, then I leased a 2013 Sonata and a 2016 Elantra. My daughter has also leased a 2013 Accent and a 2016 Elantra from this dealer. Let me give you some advice, stay away from these guys, especially getting a lease. I returned my 2013 Sonata lease and had anticipated buying the 2016 Elantra with the $5K we had saved, but I was 2K miles over the lease of 36K. This car was a 9.5 and I had just had the car detailed before we returned it. The salesman we had went out to check the car came back about 20 minutes later and informed us that we owed him $3500 for the over mileage and excessive wear and tear on the car. There was no wear and tear, he said that was the under value because of the extra mileage we had on the car. I walked out, and wanted to leave but they had already taken the car to their detail shop and had no way to return home. The salesman, at this point started to work on a new car for my wife, and only with my wife! He tried to charge her FULL Retail Sticker price for the 2016 Elantra which was $26K, wasn't even giving her the $1500 rebate that was currently being offered by Hyundai until I said something to him about it, then he wrote the whole thing up just in her name and got her into another lease. I started to try to negotiate the price as I had 3 quotes in my pocket for the same model about $3K less than what he was charging my wife. I gave him a price I was willing to pay for the car and he left to ""talk to his manager"". When he came back he told me he couldn't do my price, and then started asking me what extras and upgrades were on my 2013 turn in had on it. I said ""didn't you just spend 20 minutes looking the car over?"" After some hemming and hawing we got my price but he added the $3500 to the price of the car. What a CROOK! Next came the Finance Guy. He tries to add on all these extra's like a 5 year extended warranty, paint protection, upholstery protection, etc. First off this is a 48 month lease and he's trying to get my wife to pay for 5 years of coverage, NO not happening! She walked out of there paying for an Elantra for about $20 less than she could have gotten a BMW! MY daughter's lease also is up and we traded in for a new Ioniq at another dealer who agreed to take over the last 2 payments for her. Three weeks later she gets a bill from Hyundai Finance for $520. We call them and we find out that Port Richey Hyundai had written a $400 Disposition Fee into the lease. Basically, if we didn't buy the car or lease another car from them AND financed it through Hyundai Finance, we had to pay the disposition fee. When we bought the new Ioniq, from a different dealer in Lakeland, we tried to get Hyundai Finance but they rejected her because we were not financing enough money (We put down 50% of the OTD Price), plus they would add back in the $750 rebate that was being offered if we did finance through them, and she has a credit score of over 720! Now I have to return our 2016 Elantra, I have already bought another car and we too have an astronomical disposition fee waiting for us. I recommend to Everyone, if you are at all interested in a Hyundai, STAY AWAY from Port Richey Hyundai and Wesley Chapel Hyundai and DEFINATELY Stay away from Hyundai Finance!",2019-03-17 15:54:47

It's also wide open to Tampa's hot sun and suffocating humidity. Day games are torturous and should be attended at your own risk. 

My first experience at RJ was in 2013, when I joined the flag crew for a couple of games. We had to park far from the stadium and ride the shuttle bus. We were given a small utility room to keep our belongings in, and $15 Bucc's bucks to purchase mediocre stadium fare with. Brief instructions and a practice run were all it took to be ready for game time. To my surprise it was actually a lot of fun! The energy on the field was electric as we ran out the giant Buccaneers flag followed by the American flag. Afterwards they let us watch the game even though we didn't have seats. Finding a good place to stand was challenging. 

Buccs games include suffering through loud cannon blasts and dealing with scurvy swashbucklers. It's like a pirate themed costume party in there. The best vantage points are the 200 and 300 levels. I've sat in the very first row and saw more cheerleading than football. I witnessed the Patriots slaughter the Buccs from the first row of section 333, between the 10 and 20 yard line. 

When popular teams like the Pats and Giants are in town, the prices jack up and they sell out before public sale. The ticket ordering process for the Patriots game was stressful for me but smoothed over by the amazing staff. Hands down a five star customer service experience. The friendly and knowledgeable agent spent over an hour on the phone with me to ensure I purchased tickets I'd be happy with.

The stadium recently renovated the West Stadium Club, the only air conditioned portion of RJ. I had access during a USF Bulls game pre-makeover and thought it was a lackluster escape from the heat. Photos of the improvements look gorgeous but it's an expensive ticket to watch the game on TV. 

At $20 per car you'd expect something nicer than grassy fields but they make for fun tailgate parties. There are plenty of portable bathrooms throughout the property. Most of the time the parking lot attendants are friendly and efficient but sometimes they sandwich cars together leaving no room for tailgates. They attempted to park me between someones corn hole game. Showing up three hours early should imply a tailgating purpose, and grant proper space between rows.

Once you're on the property the staff will swarm all over you with their bag policy. It's annoying after the third confrontation. Clear bags are the only bags allowed in or around the stadium. 

Overall a decent place to watch football made worthwhile by tailgating.",2018-09-09 15:03:46

Wednesday business hours came and went and I did not receive a call to schedule delivery.  I called the delivery center and they explained that my delivery was scheduled for Friday, not Thursday (I took off of work on Thursday to be home for the delivery!) I called the delivery service on Thursday to schedule a delivery time and they said that I would receive a phone call after 6pm, no phone call ever came, so I called the delivery service again; the delivery was scheduled, but no one ever called me to inform me of my delivery time.  I explained that I needed a delivery after 2:30 and they said that that would be an extra fee (this was never explained to me when I purchased my stove, the customer service representative assured me that it wouldn't be an issue.)  At that time I expressed my disappointment in the level of customer service that I received thus far, but I would just have to have a family member come to my house so someone was there to receive the delivery.  Friday morning, the day of the delivery, I received  a phone call around 7:15am informing me that my delivery was on hold because ""I said that I wouldn't be home at the time of the scheduled delivery.""  When I called back they said it was too late, the truck already left the warehouse and that I wouldn't be able to have my stove delivered until Saturday.  Unsatisfactory customer service all around!  I tried calling the store directly to speak to a manager or the customer service representative that sold me the stove and gave me inaccurate information, but every extension that I dialed had the same message, that no one was available to take my call because they were busy helping other customers, to leave a message and they would call me back.

uWkKHiaoffInbnN9xehJMQ,8u0UtJELcJznw8ufa9-6YQ,Ld3qgGua7MqrFnZY8AIo0A,4.0,0,0,1,"Cafe Ventana is hands down, my favorite place to study. It has also been one of my favorite places for breakfast and coffee since my freshman year at SLU (I am now a junior). I absolutely love this place and recommend it for several reasons:

-The environment is perfect for whether you want to study, read a book, or even meet up to catch up with old friends over a cocktail. They also just recently opened an annex that is connected to the restaurant built for the many students that come there for studying. It has plenty of room for seating, and even if you order food from their kitchen, which is located in their main part, they will bring it to you if you sit in the annex.

-They are open early and close late. This is perfect for me, being  student especially, because I can come grab breakfast and a coffee while doing some last minute studying before my 8 a.m. class, or grab a drink and catch up with my friends late at night. 

-I have yet to have lunch here because I love going for breakfast. Their spinach and goat cheese souffle is so delicious. It's so yummy that I get it every single time I go. It's also served with a side of fresh seasonal fruit. I have also tried their beignets. They are served fresh, piping hot, and loaded with powdered sugar. Even though I get the same thing every time, they do have a wide variety of menu items for breakfast and lunch/dinner.

-Ventana has a huge drink menu. They offer good quality coffee and espresso. I prefer getting lattes, although sometimes when I go there during the afternoon, it takes a while for my coffee to come out. 

-The last reason why I absolutely love Cafe Ventana is because of their great service. I went there one morning when they first opened at 6:30. I was the first person there, and I ordered my usual breakfast. The woman working told me that it would take a while to make my souffle because the oven still needed to warm up. I didn't mind waiting because I was going to be there for a while studying. When my breakfast was ready, which took about 20 minutes, the woman working gave me a free beignet for being so patient.  That really made me want to keep coming back in the future.

All in all, I would definitely recommend Cafe Ventana.",2011-04-28 19:35:14

I came yesterday on my day off and ordered a taco salad ( mind you took almost 30 minutes to come out) when it did I was really excited! I literately took 1 bite of the taco meat. It was at room temp not even warm and the veggies were also room temp. Don't know about anyone else but does a warm salad sound good? No it's a health hazard and for anyone who has EVER worked for a restaurant should know this. When Sean came he didn't introduce himself he came up n said hey I'm the manager.... I very nicely inform him that my meat and veggies were all at room temp and I don't think it's safe to eat. He starts ARGUING with me telling me it's safe to eat. I work for a restaurant and I would never serve what they did to me to anyone. (Hello cheese was melted on the lettuce---how?) After what felt like eternity with him trying to convince me it's ok, we asked him to leave and he said "" leave? You want me to leave my own bar?"" No just leave us alone. The gentleman I was with got up to go cash out bc he couldn't take it anymore. Renee the bartender was AWESOME- she had made us 2 lemon drop shots before Sean came up... well when my friend got up to pay, the manager was still trying to argue with me n I told him to just go.. so he grabs our shots n throws them away goes behind the bar -I said thank u to my friend- and he says ""ya (insert name) get the fuck outta here"" WAIT---- did a manger who started arguing with his customers just yell that out in FRONT OF CUSTOMERS!?!! I got up n looked at Renee n she was so confused and I told her I'm sorry for ANYONE that has to work with him. I immediately call the restaurant to get his name and speak with the owner.. i got out on hold and was told Sean and the owner was Matt. So ""Matt"" gets on the phone but sounds just. Like. Sean...... I tell him this and he says quietly no I'm Matt, I inform him he didn't apologize n said he will go see. I am almost positive I was NOT on the phone with the owner. I have so many friends that go here and I know bands that play here. I am not new to the area and for this to happen at a well known beach bar really disappointed me. If Sean treats customers this was I can only imagine how he treats his employees. I won't be back nor any of my friends if he's there. U may want to rethink him as a employee. I wanted to spend ALL day there but went to The Hut after that and had a wonderful time! Sean you know how you acted and I hope you were just having a bad day prior to coming to the bar, but if you are like this all the time you DO NOT NEED TO BE IN HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY.",2017-09-19 15:17:32

I had about 8-10 quotes from other moving companies, ranging from internet based moving companies to the large recognized van lines.  It got to the point where my parents (where half my my things were stored) told me that they weren't going to let anyone else in the house to help with a quote.  

So here I was, with 8-10 quotes, and Arpin (Transtar) was the last to get into my parents house. I had to make a choice.  My move was in a few weeks....  we were going from Philly to a state down south, so it was a big move.

I ruled out the internet based moving lines, despite the fact that they were the nicest and gave me the best price.  However, I read really scary reviews where your things end up getting held hostage, movers never showing up, getting bills thousands above your initial quote, etc... so I decided not to take the chance with them.  

The large recognized national moving lines were fine, but they weren't very nice.  They gave me a ""take it or leave it"" attitude, were pushy and very sale-sy and required a huge deposit of about $2k to ""book"" with them, so....

That left Transtar/Arpin.  The sales guy was actually phenomenal.  I don't know what it was about him but he just seemed honest.  He wasn't trying to kiss my behind, he gave me a price that was comparable, and he just overall seemed to be down to earth-- and I'm a NY'er (lived there for 17 cumulative years since college) and I *think* I can spot bullsh** but you never know, right?

To top it off.... of ALL the moving companies, they didn't require a deposit of a few thousand dollars!!  

I ended up choosing Transtar/Arpin, but second guessed myself constantly.  What if they didn't show up?  What if the people who showed up were unprofessional?  What if?  What IF??  It was driving me crazy.

So on the day of the move,  they arrived as promised.  The driver was the same guy who drove all our stuff to our new place.  Half the moving crew was also the same from start to finish.  They were super professional and I'm SO glad I chose them.  A few things in our boxes broke but it was our own fault for not packing it better.  

We may move again in a year or two... and I would definitely go with Arpin/Transtar moving again.",2018-08-04 23:36:44
QVmVgS2dCpBxsG5LLFDJgQ,raWEcJRyJxgvXg7trkx_Rw,XGkqxJpcFgowB2ACFKyCnQ,1.0,32,0,2,"I've never been to a vet clinic that tries so hard to up-sell you, have never written a negative review about a vet clinic, and I've been to many due to moving around the country for work. Here's my story.

My family adopted an 8-week-old puppy from an Indianapolis rescue group. The rescue group offers a $130 rebate if the pet is spayed before it's 1st heat. I took our dog into BRAC and was offered a Bark Tudor 3 lesson course of instruction, and her spaying, for a total of $135. I stated that of course we would very much like this lessons and spaying deal. 

At our next appointment, I asked when can we start the Bark Tudor course. They tell me that our dog is now too old for the course. I am disappointed, but state that I would like to still have the dog spayed when she is ready. 

Several weeks after making the spaying appointment, they call me in to have ""blood work"" done a day or so before the spaying. The day before the appointment, we get her ""blood work"" done for $95. I've never been forewarned that this charge is in addition to the spaying, but I pay the bill anyway.

We arrive for the spaying, and after asking what the charge would be, and factoring out all the other not asked for ""goods & services"" (close to an additional $200), they tell me the charge will be $175 for the spay only. I ask what happened to $135. Then they tell me, for the first time, that you only get the $135 price if you attend Bark Tudor's three lesson course. I leave our pet with BRAC to be spayed anyway, expressing my displeasure about being misled.

I get a call from Tanya, whom I presume is the office manager, saying they cannot do the procedure until I come back and sign the authorizations. She also tells me they can't honor the $135 spaying price. I leave work and sign the authorization for spaying. I also, very calmly, express my displeasure to the desk clerk that I feel I have been baited and switched, and to pass that on to Tanya. 

Tanya calls me again, and tells me that they won't do the procedure, so I have to go pick up my dog, whom is about to go into heat at any moment. When I arrive, they almost immediately sequester me to a room. Meanwhile, I stay calm, again reservedly express my displeasure about being baited and switched (which is met without denial), and I calmly leave with our pet wishing everyone a nice weekend. 

I have never dealt with a vet clinic that is so obviously for profit and opportunistic. We have already spent several hundred dollars with BRAC, and they refuse to treat our pet because I question their billing practices and they failed to make an additional $40. At BRAC, caveat emptor (let the buyer beware)!!!! Not only are they not honoring their prior commitment, they have put me into a situation that could void the $130 rescue group's  spay rebate.",2012-06-02 14:05:43

Incredibly disappointed. 

My husband and I checked out Nami Ramen this weekend. I was so excited to see a ramen restaurant open up in the Clayton area. Looking at all the photos, the restaurant looked clean and upbeat while the food looked amazing! Let me just say... Never judge a book by it's cover! (Or in this case, it's photos!)

We walked into a very clean, modern, minimalistic space and were immediately greeted by super friendly staff. The menu was simple and easy to read. I was a little taken away by the prices, but a.) we were in Clayton b.) glancing into the restaurant I could see customers hovering over their massive bowls of broth and noodles. I figured you were getting your money's worth. 

We ordered the following:
1.) Tempura Shrimp Bao: This was probably the only item we thoroughly enjoyed. The steamed bun of soft and warm, filled with cucumber, shredded green onions, 1 tempura shrimp, and drizzled with a chipotle mayo. I could appreciate the fresh ingredients and crisp veggies, but $3 for 1 steamed bun was ridiculous. Bring it down to $2.50 and I may consider coming back for more. 
2.) Seafood Ramen: Just no. The presentation was lovely, a bowl of noodles and fragrant broth, topped with a small bed of crab meat, a soft boiled egg and a side of tempura shrimp. But wait... my bowl of noodles was luke warm. My noodles were JUST cooked enough to eat. Luke warm broth and noodles? No bueno. Even worse, the broth was way too greasy! I ate about a quarter of my meal before I couldn't eat any more. I decided to pack up the left overs and see what the broth looked like after it was chilled. That night, I took the left overs out from the fridge.... The broth had completely congealed. Gross. Good broth does NOT look like this.
3.)Jigoku Ramen: While I preferred the taste of this broth over the broth in my Seafood Ramen, it was still way too oily. I could appreciate the fresh ingredients in this dish, however I couldn't get over the fact that the noodles were sub par and luke warm. Going to open up a ramen shop? Invest in better noodles and learn how to cook them, please.
4.) Beer: Overpriced imported beer in pretty bottles.

Total: $40... FOR LUNCH!!! wtf?!

The punch: If you're going to open up a ramen restaurant, you better know how to make an amazing broth and more importantly- how to cook ramen noodles. I'd rather eat pre-packaged ramen noodles for a month then walk into this place again.

I've used rental-- including luxury rental-- management companies in the past, and  Paradise Retreats has something a bit less friendly about it. Additionally, the process of reserving was quite simply less than perfect: 

* I was told on a Sunday via a VRBO inquiry that it was indeed available for my dates, but that I couldn't book it online yet because some deal was going on. I ended up being able to book it on VRBO anyway, which I did as I was looking at a holiday weekend and was afraid it would get taken. The next day I called to finalize everything (I had a confirmation email from VRBO stating I had 24 hours to confirm), and was promptly told it had been booked by someone else in the meantime... ? I guess realizing they had no legal grounds to stand on (and that I was about to flip a lid), they did fix the issue. But had I followed their 'advice' not to book until that Monday, the house would definitely have been snapped up by someone else. 

* There was just in general a bit of a snarly person on the other line that didn't make me feel great about the whole situation (Carol, very responsive on email, but a wee less than pleasant to deal with over the phone. Frazzled? Maybe. But in a customer service role-- especially if you're claiming to be luxury-- I shouldn't ever notice this or be made to feel uncomfortable by it. 

* The reservation agreement with its million reminders that you will get evicted if [whole list of things] is the most unfriendly I've ever dealt with as well. Maybe the rental market in SB just isn't actually very luxury and they've dealt with some low-brow renters that they're trying to cover for, but it was a bit of a leap of faith to sign on the dotted line. The fact that I bought a separate travel insurance for the first time in my life for this 3-day rental-- when I've traveled extensively for longer and greater dollar amounts-- should tell you enough. It was *only* because there weren't any other homes for our group size readily available that we did it; had our group been 2 people smaller, we would have gone elsewhere 100%.

* Before our stay we asked about a pool fence for kid safety and were told no, but there was in fact an industrial cover that served the same purpose. In short, we needn't have all run out and spent hundreds of dollars on life vests, so that was less than stellar information provision.

But then, other things are excellent: 

* They are prompt in answering emails, and all emails are tracked (tracking number provided) which gives a good sense of safety that confirmations really are confirmations, etc.

* All the payment and signing is conveniently done online

* The meet & greet lady was incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and thorough, yet quick to leave us to it

* The house (Bella Vista) was simply gorgeous and perfect; everything worked, the kitchen was incredibly decked out (spices! oil and vinegar! cling-wrap & ziplocks! every pot, pan & utensil you could ever need!), and the departure process was extremely limited which indeed felt more luxury than some other places. 

Overall: it worked, we had a great time, but it could all be a bit more seamless and friendly...",2017-09-06 20:42:29
9A124shPO5GH_pPk1ixHsw,GcdYgbaF75vj7RO6EZhPOQ,my8iGnzOiOO3__WCuRRlbQ,3.0,11,8,1,"This place opened about a month ago in Westmont just down the road from Treno (love!) and right near the Pour House (love!). Parking is a hassle, even when there are seats open here. Be prepared to walk.

A friend and I headed in around 6:30 tonight and were instantly seated in the middle of the room. It's a fairly small place, and the sound echoes, so it was pretty hard to hear her.

We both opted to try the $13 cheesesteak panini... which according to the menu is: braised short rib, truffle mayo, fontina cheese (caramelized onion optional) on a rustic homemade bread.

I learned the hard way that ""onions optional"" means onions on your panini if you don't specify that you don't want them. I thought that you would have to ask for them if you want them. That to me would make sense. Instead, the panini came with onions saturated in it... and I'm not an onion fan. I instantly began to pluck them out, but soon found that it was a lost cause.

The server found me in this state -- sifting out onions -- and offered to take the sandwich back. I said no, that I'd deal, but she knew better and insisted on taking it back. She then grabbed a manager and he told me that they'd have a new sandwich out in three minutes flat. I said okay. (Note here: I never send food back. Ever. I felt awful sending this back. But I hate onions enough.)

Sure enough, a few minutes later, a new sandwich came out. And that would've been fine, but the bottom of the bread was burnt. Still, I ate around the bread, and it was a-okay. The meat was good. I really liked the mayo, too.

So then a few minutes later this man in a suit sits down at the table next to us and asks how our sandwiches taste. I say okay. He then makes a nasty comment about me saying that it's just okay. He admits to being a part owner of the place and says he's doing an unofficial survey. He says that if I don't like the sandwich, he has some dough I can play with.

...

Excuse me, Mr. Suit? Did you really just say that... as I'm fishing through the sandwich to avoid the BURNT PART, but keeping my mouth shut about the burnt part because I'm already on my second sandwich? Rude.

The rest of the meal -- my friend agreed -- was a bit awkward, as I felt uncomfortable sitting next to Mr. Suit eating my half-burnt sandwich with my fingers.

I know the place is still new, and maybe the pizza is good, but if that's the part owner, then I don't want a part of their dough in the future.

All the best to you, Bricco.",2014-05-17 00:24:48

We usually always order our food online and pick it up to eat at home.  On this particular order, I asked for the dressing on the side.  When we arrived to a friends house, the dressing had been left out of the bag.  Unfortunately we are at a friends rental where there is no dressing in the fridge and they are traveling and need to hit the road.  Needless to say, they leave without eating the salad bc who wants to eat a dry salad.  
I called up to Fresh Bar to ask if there had been dressing left out from an order purchased online.  Yes they had forgot to put it in the bag.  I asked if it would be possible for them to take the salad off bc of no dressing.  The girl on the phone passed me off to another employee who then went to the office and I could hear her talking to the manager, or whom ever, about my question.  The manager got on the phone and asked if they could deliver the dressing.  I declined bc we were all leaving town and heading in separate directions.  She then go an attitude with me and said ""you want me to take off the entire salad bc we forgot your dressing?""  Yes, I want you to take off the salad.  I hear her talking to all her employees saying ""who's going to buy this salad for our customer.""  Are you kidding me???  I don't want an employer to buy the salad for me, I just wanted them to know they had forgot the freaking dressing and if you could comp me this ONE time.  From there it escalated and I have never been treated the way she spoke to me.  Worst customer service!!!  I mentioned to her we live in the neighborhood and we visit Fresh Bar regularly, but I would not be returning bc of her attitude.  She had the audacity to tell me I guess your not the type of  customer who fits our brand and hung up on me.  This employee needs to have an attitude check quick.  I called back and they would answer and then hang right back up.  Finally a guy answered and I asked who the owner was and he told me he was.  He did not seem to care what had just happened and the employer told him I grabbed the bag before she could put the dressing in it.

First thing of the bat, make sure you call ahead if you want to dine inside... which I highly recommend. If they can accommodate you, they will gladly attempt! If you want to try something new, support local business, and give Asian food a second chance in Reno, come here.

Food (4.5/5)
I ordered the Pad Kee Mao, aka Drunken Noodles, with chicken. I was looking for a yellow curry, which wasn't on the menu at this time. However, this is my second favorite Thai dish. I ordered it a 2/5 on heat scale. I recommend that if you can handle heat, you should order a 3 or 4. I found the 2 still relatively tame. Yet, they do supply spice on the side to increase the heat to your desire. I was really impressed by the quality of veggies that they used, including mushrooms and various colored bell peppers. So all my vegetarians and vegans, hit up this spot. The noodles were tasty, chicken tender, and flavor overall very savory. Best Thai experience for me in Reno so far.

Drinks (5/5)
I ordered a Thai iced tea without boba. Some Thai iced teas are too sweet and you can't really appreciate the flavor of the tea. However, this one had such a perfect balance. It was sweet, but it was still pulling forward tea flavor. I like the way that they serve it to you as well. It comes in a Frapuccino style appearance, and is delicious!They are able to accommodate you if you don't do dairy by substituting the milk with coconut milk.

Service (5/5)
The lady working was able to accommodate me immediately without a reservation, so that was really nice her. It appears that this is a family that runs the restaurant, which I really like to see. We got to talk to all of the staff, and they were all so nice and appreciative. We were even given a cookie at the end of our meal as a token of gratitude. Polite, kind, and attentive.

Ambience (5/5)
This is a beautiful restaurant. I know that they are brand new, and I hope that they keep the clean, modern, and pretty appearance they have established. Each table is adorned with fresh orchids. It is definitely a place of peace and it almost feels like you're at a spa. I like the style and choices that they made in this space.

Today while running errands and in the midst of being stuck in traffic we checked the menu and decided to give it a try. This is a fast food type place. Think Subway but for whatever genre cuisine this is. When we walked in we noticed all of the menu holders were empty. Okay. (There's no hung menu either.) Someone utilizing a menu was kind enough to bring one back for all to share. We settled on what to order and stepped up to the assembly line. I should've just turned around then, alas, I was starving. The entire prepped food area was a disaster. Spills, bits off food everywhere, just a mess. Everyone working was a teenager so I chalked this up to their general lack of care. I ordered a Mediterranean Power Bowl (I think that's the name.) The contents were hastily slopped in a bowl and pushed to the next kid in the line up. A young woman wearing a white chef's coat (lol) was just calling off the items to the cashier at the end as opposed to maybe cleaning the disarray or cooking anything. She had on a ton of jewelry and a headband and sunglasses on her head- it was all bizarre. (Cause what chef is adorned like that?) We paid for our food and went to find a table. I then realized that this place is filthy. Every table, chair, and even the floor was littered with food waste. The trash can was near overflowing. Oh! I found a stack of menus, too! (So I took them over to the entryway and put them in their place.) We cleaned off a spot and ate our food. It was fine. I just couldn't stop thinking about how chaotic everything was and wondering if the person who chopped the vegetables had worn gloves or if the food was old. Food borne illness could be in my future. (Seriously there was not one person who looked like they cared about absolutely anything.) I shudder to think what their restroom must look like!  I dig the concept of semi healthy food on the go but will never step foot in this place again. Filthy teens shouldn't be in charge of restaurants- most of them can't clean their rooms adequately. I think that's where the hygiene/cleanliness issues originate. Still. Someone needs to go address the employees & either retrain or start over. Better yet hire some adult supervision. I wouldn't trust these kids to hand out Halloween candy.

We did not even get to SEE or TEST DRIVE the car we signed a premium priced lease contract for. On top of that, we signed it under an unusual sense of urgency that made us feel like we were under pressure. We were deceived by being sold on one number and being told we were getting the best deal, and then they closed the deal on a totally a much higher price. They spent 15 minutes selling the car on a lower number, and 5 minutes closing the deal on a higher number. In fact, they just rushed us through the whole process even when we requested for a night to think about it. The deal was beneficial for their own for their own security. WE GOT RIPPED OFF. They focused on their own vested interest and their bottom line, which never helps a business's reputation in the long run. They don't even realize why this is wrong.. on a lease contract valued approximately ~$32,000 (~$17,000 guaranteed) and telling us they used all the discounts in the world to bring the price of the Chrysler 200 S vehicle down to approximately ~$26,000. To tack on an additional ~$6,000 ON A LEASE?? Bad credit or not, they screwed us over. They have created a  horrible sales culture at Brandywine CJDR, in which they have NO INTEGRITY and no genuine intentions of addressing the problems and concerns of their customers. FAIR WARNING TO ALL: I WISH I went to CARMAN Chrysler instead.

Considering that we were RUSHED and pressured through our sale, and considering that we REQUESTED a night to think about it, and they pushed us on a contract paying $473 a month for a Chrysler 200 S that was supposedly discounted to almost $25,000. It's clear they mislead us into the wrong vehicle. As advertised on their website for well under $473 a month on a 36 month lease contract I should be driving a 300 S. My desired outcome is an exchange of the 200 S they put us in for a 300 S. Even Carman Chrysler dealer in New Castle had advised me, for that price they would have easily put us in a 300 S. I honestly wish we had a fair chance to actually drive the vehicle and think about the decision we were being rushed into. In hindsight it also gravely concerns me how much this experience resembles predatory sales practices.

Members bring toys and while most of us share them, there are a few kids (and moms) that suggested not sharing their toys.   We went into the family pool a few times, but mostly I avoided it since my son can't swim.  It gets to 5 feet deep.  Besides that are two other olympic of larger sized pools for play, diving, and a lap pool.  The life guards are very attentive, and it's pretty clean.  My son also loves the playground.  

   It was open from Memorial Day to Labor Day from 11am - 8pm everyday.  There are various events on the calendar including parties with DJ's and ""Bring a Guest for free Day"".  You can also book an event here for $5 per person.  

  I suggest buying into membership early in the year when you receive a small discount.  Also make sure you plan on going often because it is so expensive.  If you don't plan on going often, then just get a season pass for one person and pay a $10 guest visit every time you bring one or buy a book of 10 for a discounted rate.   

  Even though it's closed for the season, when I ask him what he wants to do today, he replies ""Pool"".  We'll certainly become a member next year unless we acquire our own pool.",2010-09-12 15:11:11
HXokPt7FfHeRmrro3OJYOg,P-92kBuA6395l7qLrxMvvA,rVhmnWiH3LG4awvQtgHqvA,1.0,8,3,0,"Absolutely ridiculous. Shadiest excuse of a company. I signed up for a 3 year membership where the third year was free (for referring ""x"" number of friends to get memberships). I had the promotional price of $27/month and was generally happy with the service and gym during my trial period. As soon as I signed the papers and set up automatic payments, the staff stopped caring. I've been assigned to 3 different personal trainers who have no showed, didn't know what they were talking about, and overall seemed like they didn't care. When I complained about this, the staff refused to give me the contact information for a ""higher-up"", and told me I was still responsible for paying for the sessions where the trainers no-showed because I signed an agreement. What kind of bullshit is that. They are the laziest people I know. They say they encourage everyone to sign on for 3 years because they believe in commitment and dedication but they're closed earlier than every other gym in the city and closed for as many holidays as possible (when these are the holidays people indulge and WANT to work out the most).

Fast forward two years: my third year was supposed to be free but when I noticed payments still coming out of my account they said it wasn't part of my agreement! I brought in a copy of my contract where it was written and the staff told me I would have to send a hand-written letter with a copy of my drivers license and send it to their head office. I NEVER received a response, and I ended up paying for my last year. On top of that, my promotional price of $27/month INCREASED to $38. For what? I never found out.

After that, I stopped going to this joke of an establishment and continued to waste the $38/month counting down the months until my term with SpaLady was over. When my contract ended, I was pissed to see SpaLady STILL taking money out of my account. Enraged, I had to waste my time to go in and talk to someone, who ended up telling me that it was my responsibility to write a letter to their head office 60 days in advance to tell them my contract was ending and to stop the automatic withdrawls from my account. WHY THE HELL would it be my responsibility?

Don't even bother getting a membership with the scum who work here. They are such pathetic excuses for human beings.

I forgot to add the best part: one of the employees approached me at the lockers and asked if she could buy drugs from me. Haha seriously, steer clear of the losers here. Loser workers,  loser company.",2015-03-24 06:19:41

I live in Tahoe (only an hour away) so I didn't really want to pay $310 to stay at the Peppermill for the weekend. The room for this place was originally $80 per night but got an online discount. It ended being $60ish a night... Good deal, right? Oh, I could not have been more wrong!

My boyfriend had to work but he was to follow a couple hours later so I checked in alone. Since we booked with his card, I figured we could TRY to just keep it all on one card. I knew the chances of this happening was very unlikely without him being present due to the possibilities of fraud.. I figured I could suggest they allow me to check in early with his card, on the condition that he present himself and his ID when he arrived. 

At check-in, Mr. Front desk asked for my ID- which I handed over while telling him that I had my boyfriend's card. Before I could finish my sentence, he very rudely cut me off and said that I needed the ID that went with the card, while THROWING my ID back at me onto the counter. (Now, before a manager tries to respond to this post with some snide response about fraud and security PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVE ALREADY TACKLED THAT SUBJECT). My issue is not directed at the fact that I could not use my boyfriend's credit card without him being present, as that was assumably and rightfully so. My issue was the way Mr. No-Customer-Service cut me off while I was speaking and threw my ID onto the counter. Rather than assuming I did not have a credit card of my own, he could have listened. Yes, I do have my own money. Yes, I am a customer and would like to be treated respectfully. Yes, you can at the very least PRETEND that you enjoy your job since you're the first face I see (with a frown). I pulled out my credit card and picked my ID up and mimicked the way he thew my ID me. He had the audacity to ask me in a condescending tone ""How IS your day?"". And I responded by saying ""It WAS going well"".  Yeah, two seconds into this transaction and already going horribly. You would think it'd stop there but there's more folks!

Got to my room and notice a HOLE in the bathroom with exposed electrical wires. Mmm, an eyesore and a safety issues. Grrrrreat. So, naturally I call the front desk for a room change. Low and behold, the person who answers is Mr. No-Customer-Service.
Must be my lucky day!!! I tell him the issues and requested a room change. He complies... As HE HUFFS AND PUFFS OVER THE PHONE. I can clearly hear his dismay. Oh. My. God. I feel like I am bothering this man!!! Don't mind me over here... Just paid money for this room. Didn't want a hole with exposed wires...

So I take my wedding dress to be altered, it needs to be shorter which the woman assures me she can do in two weeks. This is after I get done standing there sweating waiting for her to measure my dress in a changing room of her sweat shop work house while she's off talking with other customers. 

A couple days before my promised pick up date, I decided to listen to my gut and call just to make sure it'd be ready. 
Not only is it NOT going to be ready on that day but she has the nerve to ask if I can wait FOUR more days!! 
I told her absolutely not and she promises it first day after the weekend. I show up that day and oh wait, it's STILL not ready!!!

When I asked why and why didn't she call me, she gives me this story about how she took a day off and just got back to work that day. Says she works so hard, all the time working, to which I'm like aren't we all?! 

No excuse. Watch out, if it's important, take it elsewhere. This wedding dress is literally the most important piece of clothing I'll probably ever have and I can't tell you enough to shop around and save yourself some aggravation in an already pressing time as your prepare for your wedding. 

---

And then after picking it up and looking over it - 

1. IT'S OFF CENTER!!! 
See photo I'm holding it front and center at the bottom in the photo and as you can see, like she clearly couldn't, IT'S ABSOLUTELY OFF CENTER. 
How hard is it to pick a scallop, big or small, to be in the center? She picks the middle of both so that it's not ANYWHERE near symmetrical!! 

2. The lace is bubbled up like she sewed it back on without care. Now it won't lay flat and it won't and lightly grace the floor like it's supposed to do.

3. Another reason it won't lay flat is that the hem is folded up and sewn down and not snipped off so that it's flat. Did she even care when she did this? 

4. Whatever her reasoning, she sewed lace on top of another existing lace pattern so now it just looks like one big blob pile of lace. Did she not care or was she blind to how that takes away from the lace patterning that MAKES the dress?

How does she call herself a seamstress?  I've never been so angry in my life. How can she take a job and promise it to be done (and fail to deliver) and never once offer as much as an apology to the customer. 

She is so rude and talked to me like it was my fault she didn't have the dress ready when she said she would have it done. 
When my fiancé tried calling to address the situation, she hung up on him MULTIPLE times after hearing what he was calling about.

She would not honor a refund saying ""I do good job. It very hard."" That's straight up sorry. I'm saving the rest of my choice words but you can imagine how angry I am. 

We went to The Alteration Shoppe to get her hack job taken care of. 3250 Severn Ave Metairie, LA 70122. They'd run you a little more but it's absolutely worth it to avoid this frustration should anything happen to you like what happened to me.",2017-06-06 05:47:03

I called for an estimate and to explore my options.The Lady (Barb?) who received my call wanted to know how big my tanks were and booked an appointment. I assumed the appointment would include a discussion about what my options would be before any work was done.
.
ProSolutions called me the day before the install. I was called by Connie who suggested she send over a ""comfort consultant"" to see what my needs were and present me with options. (Apparently the booked install did not include a quote or consultation.) I agreed. The next morning Connie examined my system, and we discussed my options. Replacing the old tanks with new tanks best met my needs. We re-booked for the following day, and I had a quote in hand for the work to be done. Connie was very pleasant.
 
The install appeared to go smoothly.4 guys were there to help move the tanks. Ed and his helper (in Training) Jason were clean fast and efficient. 4 hours to install 2 hot water tanks.
 
The next morning my basement had a very slight smell of natural gas. (As a Firefighter, I deal with gas leaks and natural gas odors frequently and it is very familiar to me. This was very slight, and definitely not an emergency.) I opened a window, told my wife about the leak, and left for work. My wife called ProSolutions, and a fellow named Sandy showed up to determine the problem. He used a soap solution and a gas sniffer and could not detect a leak. However, Sandy told my wife that you can't vent these two hot water tanks out a 3 inch vent pipe (The two 17 year old, cheaper, less efficient, hot water tanks had no issue) and that we need to upgrade our system to a 4 inch vent pipe. He quoted her $300 and it could be done the next day. I called Sandy, and he stated that the 3 inch pipe is ""not up to code."" I asked Sandy how a smell of natural gas could be present in burned natural gas exhaust fumes that are being forced back into my house by inadequate venting? He could not answer me (It is impossible) and instead stated that he didn't smell natural gas, or detect a leak.(Relevance?)
 
I called Pro-Solutions and they agreed to fix the venting issue free of charge. Their dispatcher Carly recommended I phone ATCO to fix the gas leak. Carly was very pleasant.
 
I called ATCO (The gas Company) and they showed up and found and fixed the natural gas leak.
 
Soooo..... Initially tanks were booked to be installed without a consultation, neither the consultant nor the tank installers identified that my venting was inadequate, The Tank installers left my house with a natural gas leak which smells terrible and could build up and blow up the house, the tech sent to fix the natural gas leak found an exhaust vent problem that could result in Carbon Monoxide (Odorless, Poisonous) being forced back into my house killing my whole family, the gas company found and fixed the nonexistent gas leak, and It took 4 days to get it done. However, everyone I dealt with was very, very pleasant.

I called today and asked for an email address I could send a complaint to. I was given a nonexistent address. If it had been real I never would have taken the time to post this.

After purchasing tickets for me and my son, we went to the concession stand to by popcorn and soda. We stayed in one line and when it was our turn to be served the cashier just left and never returned, without saying anything and then the supervisor came and told me the line was closed. I went to the other line and when it was my turn to order I asked for the supervisor. When I explained to her that the way I was treated wasn't right, she told me that the other line was closed and that there was nothing else that she could have done, I had to go to another line.
I got my popcorn and soda and they were preparing another small popcorn at the time and I told them that was not for us because we only ordered one popcorn and one soda and they just said that they knew it wasn't for us, so we left to watch the movies. When we left the theater, in the car, my son was asking me how much he spent off of his gift card, since he used his gift card at the concession stand. We checked the receipt only to find out that they over charged us for that small popcorn. Kind of fishy, taking in consideration that it was immediately after I had complained about their customer service and I had advised them at the time that the second popcorn wasn't for me at the time of the purchase and they acknowledged it wasn't for me. 
When I went back inside to speak to a manager for my refund, I had to deal with a lot of hostility from the manager who was making it seem like I was over reacting and started to be very disrespectful when I told her that I needed to read my receipts before I sign anything since they already overcharged me once. I asked to speak to her manager about it and she threatened to call the security so I had to call the police myself.  They never bothered to give me an apology. The conclusion is that if you ever dare to speak up when there is a problem, they will try to get you in trouble so they can save their pitiful skins. So sad. This is what happens when there is only one movie theatre in the whole west bank. No competition and crapy service. My friends warned me before that this was a ghetto theater but I never listened. I guess they were so right.  If they don't want my business, I don't want their's either. There are always so many other choices.",2014-03-05 03:26:19

Indiana only recently changed its laws to allow small-scale distilleries to operate at all, but this is not the first such business. It's just a restaurant and bar.
But mostly bar. It's really a bar that serves food. I come here quite often for lunch because of its proximity to my office (big plus in the winter) and its reasonably-priced lunch specials. Those usually run $7-10, depending on what, exactly, it is. But I've gotten a half rack ribs for $9 before, and that included fries and slaw.
And that's generally the case here: everything is very reasonable. You won't find $12 burgers or $35 steaks like some places in town. There are a lot of sandwiches, all running under $10. Granted, I have not been here for dinner, and they do have a different dinner menu, so they may go up in price quite a bit then.
For the actual food, it's really run the gauntlet. The first time I was here, I had something with a side of red beans and rice. Since I grew up on that sort of stuff, I'll hold off on talking about it, but I will say that you should not go out of your way for it. Despite the name, they don't seem to have many ""cajun"" options, at least when I've gone. On their web site, they say ""best ribs in Indianapolis""... Not sure about that, but it may be true. The ribs are not that good, but I actually have not had any other ribs in Indy, so, in spite of that, they may actually be the best. The pulled pork sandwich is decent enough.
The atmosphere can get weird. It's a bar, but it gets busy with office workers at lunch, and that's an odd combination. The last time I was in here, I sat at the bar, and there was a drunk guy who sounded exactly like the bear from The Cleveland Show (and kinda looked like him too). He swilled his swill and tried to talk to me about his problems. But trying to BS with a guy who has less than an hour to spare on his lunch like you would with a guy alone at a bar is not going to work.
I see a lot of complaints about the service here, and that's valid enough. It's not usually very friendly. Don't expect Hooters or Macaroni Grill. The servers are few and they're typically pretty busy. But my food has always come out pretty fast when I needed it to.
Cool building though. Great upstairs patio.",2014-02-07 14:58:51
MiLnlHePsczFsJtk9LOUYw,vbIE4XdBlzD2ObkOfS6czg,DzjOYSKnjmYYBwMUcIAKcw,5.0,4,3,7,"My husband and I decided to try it out here on a whim tonight (Thursday) as the menu was all half price - I'm so happy we did! We split a huge burger and a very generous portion of truffle fries with dip, had a bevvy each, and a handful of tokens for just $35  Totally worth it on all fronts! 

Firstly, I love that Beercade is upbeat but has that pub feel. With the bar at the center of the venue, a raised stage at the back, arcade & pinball games on the other walls, and tons of seating throughout, the set up has a nice flow. There's also tons of big TVs with sports on! The staff are all super friendly and quick to get your order, bring your food & drinks, and to check in. Our server had a lot of knowledge on the menu - it's always nice when you're not trying to figure things out WITH the servers bc they have no clue. 

We split the Double Double burger (sans veggies cuz hubs isn't into it) which comes with two patties, 2 pieces of bacon, and two pieces of cheese on a brioche (maybe?) bun and house sauce. I'm not sure what the house sauce was, but I really liked it. I saw one other person review that it tasted like Big Mac sauce, but my husband won't go near that stuff and he devoured his half of the Double Double burger. The patties were thin and flavourful - just how I like mine! - and homemade  The bacon was thin too, but it was all good cuz it covered more of your bites. The cheese? Cheesy  I apologize for not knowing the type of bun that was used, but it's the kind that can sometimes be kind of waxy on the outside of the top half - that shiny kind - which this one thankfully was not! I thoroughly enjoyed each bite! Our burger was $6.25

They had tacos and other sandwiches as well, all which I look forward to trying in the future!

Sides were on for $3.50 tonight - normal fries, tater tots, kettle chips, yam fries, and truffle fries. I still hadn't tried truffle fries ANYWHERE yet, so opted for this option  YUMMAY!!! My husband said they smelled like the bottom of a mouldy foot, but I dunno... I found them SUPER flavourful and am  all about that stinky food life (I didn't find them to be of a bad smell tho...) I got them with the lemon aioli (which I also haven't had before) and I looooooved this dip  The dip was only $1 and came with enough to dip the whole serving of fries in. The serving was enough that three people could split it! 

Hubs got a fraught beer for $4. Some kind of bitter beers were on for $3, though neither of us tried it - not really beer people. 

They have a lot of pinball machines, as well as modern arcade games and some from previous decades for a throw back. I loved the Mario Kart game 

The crowd seemed about the 18-25 range, kind of the quiet type. 

Lots of different kinds of music played which was nice that they could kind of cater to everyone. 

For such a cheap date night, we'll definitely be back! I'm not one to spend $12 on a single burger when I make my own pretty same good at home, so I loved that we got a meal for two for the same price as a fast food place here tonight but with much superior quality. 

I think this is our new Thursday night spot! I get my yummy stinky fries and hubs gets to play a ton of arcade and pinball games. The chill vibe means you don't even have to get all supa fancy for a fun night out and everyone there seemed to be in pretty good spirits

I was underwhelmed by the photos of this place, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt based on the great reviews. Now - to make sure no one else makes the same mistake, I'm telling you - go somewhere else. 

First of all, the lobby and ambiance were just as shabby as I thought. When I was led into a little, private room and told to remove my clothing, I immediately noticed that the sheets on the bed (that I was supposed to lay on) had a large stain on it. I asked the woman to change them and to her credit, she seemed embarrassed, but that should NEVER happen. To make matters worse, the sheets she replaced them with, (while sans stain), were a dingy, greyish color. I wanted to turn around and go right after that, but didn't want to seem like a diva so I just told myself they were clean and hopefully they were purchased in that grey color.

I disrobed, placed my clothes on a little stool as there was no other place for me to put them, and when my masseuse came in, she asked if she could move my clothes some place else. I figured, maybe she was going to sit on the stool. I'll reveal at the end of this exactly what was done with my clothing, and said stool.

Now on to the massage. To be honest, it felt really amateur. She spent the whole 60 mins just rubbing massage oil all over me. There was no real technique. I'm used to a masseuse or masseur actually using their fingers to get in there and work the kinks and tension out. This actually just felt like someone making sure I was heavily moisturized for an entire hour. Not to mention, she rubbed my bare buttocks, then feet (notice I said rubbed not massaged) and then promptly proceeded to ""massage"" my face! I'm all about a face massage, but to touch the skin on my face with the same hands you used to touch the bottom of my feet, without washing your hands?!!

Ok so this is way longer than I meant to rant, but I'll leave it at this. Once this ""massage"" was finally over, I opened my eyes to notice that the stool she removed my clothes from was empty. She never used it to my knowledge, and my clothes were placed in my tote bag I had hanging up. So I get that this place may not have lockers, that's fine. But if it wasn't for the bag I use to carry my groceries, where would she have placed my clothes? On the floor??

Zen Massage means well. I believe they're trying, but I'd definitely recommend you spend your money elsewhere. I'll be looking for another place to go within the week, because the oil rub down just didn't cut it.",2018-01-30 04:11:17
aeGMbTyxKJW2Ec7ZoF48Ew,bJ5FtCtZX3ZZacz2_2PJjA,9PZxjhTIU7OgPIzuGi89Ew,3.0,9,4,4,"El Vez is one of those Philly restaurants that has remained constant for well over a decade. Its one of the first restaurants Jose Garces worked at before he won Iron Chef, saw his own restaurant empire start to rise, gradually disintegrate, and become rebuilt in a new way.

That is one way that the Philly restaurant scene has evolved since El Vez has remained a solid constant. But another way exists directly outside of it where restauranteurs like Marcie Turney & Valerie Safran, Michael Schulson, and the restaurant group behind Zavino have developed a growing restaurant empire within the same area. Meanwhile El Vez might not even be the best Spanish influenced restaurant under Starr so long as El Rey remains an incredible spot that leads to a not that hidden cocktail bar in Rittenhouse Square, and Stephen Starr gets ready to open a new Mexican restaurant in Fishtown (https://www.phillymag.com/foobooz/2020/02/18/stephen-starr-fishtown-mexican-restaurant/).

All of this said above is to not so successfully summarize the reasons why El Vez often gets overlooked in today's Philly restaurant scene. I don't even think I would have come to rediscover over my past couple of visits if it weren't for spots like Charlie Was A Sinner and Sampan being so crowded when my crew set foot in them first. And really that's kind of a shame, because even though it's usually far from my first choice for bar/restaurant to hit up on the block, and its especially far from my first choice for Mexican/Spanish food in the city, the constant that it delivers does always hold up as a good one!

I've covered many times over how I tend to prefer the more traditional Spanish restaurants over the more trendier TexMex varieties. But even though El Vez does appear to stand at the top of the trendy pile when you walk in and look at it, it does also tend to dish out some pretty impressive food! Favorite of mine include:

""Bazooka"" Limon Guacamole: I normally prefer my Guacamole to be the tried and true original flavor! But with goat cheese, chile flake, pistachios, and roasted tomatoes added in, this one really knows how to stand out for the better!

Queso Fundido de Hongos: Otherwise a fun and more appealing way of saying cheesy fungus. But with this one having truffled wild mushrooms and huitlacoche (a more fun way of saying corn fungus which is actually pretty good) inside a melted blend of cheese, its a very fun guy fungi!

Taco Arabes: Slow roasted lamb mixed with morita chiles, cucumber salsa, and lime yogurt for that refreshing win with just a tinge of spice.

Short Rib Enchiladas: Served perfect and simple with chocolate mole sauce!

With a tequila list like theirs you know that El Vez does some pretty impressive flights and margaritas. But I'm not that weird in finding their Knockout Margarita with vodka to be a stand out one. But ultimately my favorite cocktails are their refreshing Guava Mojito, and their boozy bit of spicy bourbon decadence in El Viejo!

While it may always be far from my first choice when I'm in the food centric neighborhood that is the Midtown Village Gayborhood, El Vez does always manage to have a few standout things that make me McThrilled when I do show up!",2020-03-11 05:44:13
87Cvcmr68PSSPWyk2aOSDQ,DEOH_z7QaXnrH7vnmDl5KA,68b9-2VCkQQ_Rj-dYQPfMw,3.0,2,1,1,"The stadium itself is very well designed, even up in the corners and end zone, the view is okay.  Seats are roomy and comfortable, the scoreboard is easily visible, the sound system is clear though set a tad too loud.  It's outdoors in the Florida Sun, it should go without saying, but the sunblock needs to be on before arrival. Compared to Green Bay, this stadium is more comfortable (though not as historic) and compared to Chicago's Soldier Field this place has better pricing. The concourse and ramp areas are generously wide and well labeled, it's easy to get around and even in a well attended event there's little claustrophobic pressure from fan density. If your team is in the Outback Bowl, do not hesitate to come, Tampa is a great place for a New Year's Day game.  There are some drawbacks, none fatal, some should be fixable.
   A problem shared by many college bowl venues is the dismal efficiency of the concessions crews.  Experience is everything when it comes to the quality and speed of sports arena concessions service, it was like the whole crew was working for the first time ever.  Given the nature pro football stadiums, I'm not sure how they could collect and place an experienced crew for single events but that would be a sensible goal - keeping the same gang that works the pro games plus concerts intact.  Concessions service at baseball games is always poor the first homestand, but by mid June things start humming along.  Here, at the Outback Bowl, it was painful to watch and wait for the three-man process of preparing and serving a single overpriced hot dog, the wrapping alone was like a comedy skit.  It was like they were working underwater.  It would be more amusing and entertaining if the concessions prices weren't so high, it was one of our most expensive meals for our trip, actually worse than eating at the airport. 
   A preliminary problem is accessibility.  Traffic on game days is dismal, made worse by perennial road construction and the peculiar decision to cut off public transportation.  On non-even days, the stadium is well served by the county bus system, there's a transit station right by the North Entrance.  Inexplicably, they encourage more day of game car traffic by shutting down that transit station and rerouting public buses away from the stadium until well after the end of the game.  You can't count on Lyft or Uber drivers to know how to handle a drop off, but you can make it work with a little geographic knowledge.  Look at your ticket, identify the closest gate.  Lyft drivers rely on GPS, which directs them to the South Entrance, the official address of the Stadium.  This means too many people try to get in through Gate C, which has the longest slowest line.  Gates A and D often have shorter faster lines, so if that's closest to your seats, that's what you should aim for.  Don't expect the Lyft driver to know north from south, if you know ahead of time, you could save a lot of time, it's faster to walk around the stadium than to drive around the stadium.  
   Parking around the stadium is expensive ($20 or so for a bowl game) and quite a distance.  Our solution was to walk west and south (over half a mile, and yet many people had to park this far) to La Teresita Restaurant on Columbus, stuff ourselves with really good Cuban food for surprisingly little money, refuel on sweets and cafe con leche at La Teresita Cafe - allowing time for the route 7 bus service to be restored, one easy transfer and we were back downtown.",2016-01-06 17:13:21

So, they chose, in my opinion a pretty trendy neighborhood off Jasper Ave. Located where the old Suede used to be, you can't miss it as you drive in and out of downtown.

Décor, it's hitting high notes with brick walls, wooden accents and hip jazz playing in the restaurant. I feel like having Scotch on the rocks as I stroke my non-existing mustache. What's even a bigger bonus is a functional patio.

I'm not an expert on Japanese liquors so we decided to not pull the trigger on the sake. The sake can range from 13 dollars for 300 mls to a whopping 45 for a bottle. We ordered a jug of Sapporo which sadly if bought in Canada, you're more likely to be tasting Beer crafted in Guelph, Ontario rather than Japan. For 25 bucks, you get about 6 pints.

Next, we ordered some appies, and entrées and rolls. The fried tofu was ok. It was fried, it was soft, everything you expect from a fried tofu dish. Nothing to write home about. The sauce could have left a better impression but it wasn't detracting.
The tuna tataki. This is where it kind of all fell apart. The fried shallots were a nice touch but the pieces itself were hacked up pretty good. It seemed like the chef was using a bad knife because the ends of the pieces weren't cut cleanly. The portions itself were actually pretty minimum. If you'd like to compare quantity as well as quality, I would urge you to order the tuna tataki from Cactus Club and compare it here. The difference is quite high and surprisingly better at Cactus considering it's not even a Japanese restaurant.
We ordered 6 oysters and I've never eaten cold oysters before but I'm very sure my description of it should not be like sticking your head in a dirty beach. It honestly tasted and smelled fishy.
We had also ordered the chicken karage. Battered and toasty hot, I'm glad the pieces of chicken were plentiful.
We ordered the chef's assortment of sashimi. Presentation was creatively put together with squid lying in a champagne flute. The sashimi was fine although I felt the quality is not as high as Furosato or Sushi Wasabi.
Our main entrées were random maki rolls. Although I don't remember the names, I believe these were thoughtfully crafted and were probably the highlight of the meal. My only concern was the maki rolls with tuna or salmon wrapped around the roll were on the thin side and wasn't as fresh as I'd hope for.

If you have room, definitely check out the matcha creme brulé. The caramelized sugar was a perfect balance to the bitter matcha.

Creatively appeasing and above average in taste, I would recommend anyone curious to check out the new Japanese flavor. Just be prepared to dig deep into those wallets: bill came out to about $52 per person.",2013-05-22 17:46:19
ceMgy3Nj6SdQpSESdomRHw,9lARNYMvHcHmVVwIsEPKXw,GWv1-6HFvZf4cOy1J6_CKQ,5.0,4,1,2,"Okay, so I see tons of reviews from locals for this place.  This review is for the unfortunate fellow west-coaster who has come to the Philly area and is now attempting to find good Mexican food.

We moved to Philly from SoCal in July 2012.  In SoCal, being, let's be honest, Northern Mexico, Mexican food is not called Mexican food, it's called food.  So, when moving to the Philly area, I'm sure you can imagine our dismay to find that Philly sucks at Mexican food.  That's sucks with a capital S.  My first experience with Mexican food was at a restaurant in the downtown area.  They had a ""Mexican food"" section on their menu.  I was delighted.  I asked the server about it.  She told me their Mexican food was amazing because almost their entire kitchen was Mexican.  Great!  Sold!  NOPE.  What I got was comida gringa.  I was given a burrito with green bell peppers in it, refried beans out of a can and what I'm assuming was supposed to pass for guacamole.  For ANYONE who knows anything about authentic Mexican food, there are NO green bell peppers in burritos, er'body knows what Rosarita refried beans taste like (butt), and guacamole shouldn't be the consistency of anything that comes from Jamba Juice.

Thus began my 20 month decent into resentment and disappointment with Philly's ""Mexican food.""  It became the running joke that Philly will slap avocado on anything and call it ""California"" and wrap anything in a store-bought tortilla and call it ""Mexican.""  Then, completely out of the blue, this Mexican place popped up on Main in Manayunk.  Now I have to be totally honest, I refused to try it for 3 months because I just knew it was going to be another disaster, but when I did, OMG, this is the real deal.

The guacamole is almost better than my fave spot in San Diego.  It's chunky, alive with flavor and it tastes and smells like summer.  The red and green salsas offset each other nicely, like they should.  Their carnitas tacos are amazing... and for someone who used to live on carnitas street tacos in San Diego, that's a huge compliment.  Their fish tacos are not too airy and not too heavy, with a new twist on a very traditional style.  The fundido is mouth-watering and doesn't leave grease dripping down your hands and arms.  They have too many types of tequila and beer to count.  This isn't the place to come order a cosmopolitan.  This is a Mexican restaurant people.

Basically, this place is amazing.  For all of you haters in Philly, come to Cali, try real Mexican food, and then come back and complain.  For those of you in Philly from SoCal looking for ""food,"" the real deal, this is the spot.",2014-10-08 23:31:11
lBdySO5dFRL0OhE84M9ZJw,aQt_0nNZLD3rOOvbZlR8hA,jzAN3WQf-iJY3AURfh1cYw,1.0,1,5,0,"So, I'm in town on business and I always read reviews when I'm traveling for good delivery Chinese/Asian food.  Yelp has great reviews for this place and it's close enough to the hotel that they deliver.

I ordered the #95, no way I can spell or even pronounce the actual dish's name, but it's shrimp with peanuts, lemongrass and some other stuff on top of vermicelli noodles.  Sounded good.

Get the delivery and open it up.  Looks really good.  Came with a Vietnamese side salad and dipping sauce on the side as well.  Very good looking plate.

Until I start looking at the shrimp on top of the noodles.  I see what looks like a hair.  I think maybe not since some Asian spice powders/etc that I've seen and have used myself in cooking at home have sketchy looking consistencies.

But I pull it out...definitely a hair.  Not a huge deal, but I continue to look and find one more.  Now the picture is disturbing.  Continued to pick through the shrimp and found about 6 hairs of varying color from black to gray all in the shrimp in about 2 minutes of looking.  Ugh.

I have never, EVER called a delivery joint up to ask what the heck they plan to do about the situation, BUT I call them and tell them the horrible discoveries I have found.  

The woman was kind of speechless and passed me on to who I assume was a manager or owner?  I repeated what I said and he asks if I was sure.  Seeing I've had hair since I can remember I answer I'm very sure that I know what hair is.  He asks if I want something else?  I say no, a refund would be just fine.  He said someone would be over shortly and then keeps talking on the phone about the hair and no idea how that happened.

I said I just ordered it, his establishment made it and he should be asking the people making the food.

After hanging up, I close the box of horrors and put it back in the plastic bag it was delivered in, expecting to give it back to whomever showed up at my door.

Another guy (not the original delivery guy) shows up at the hotel room door.  I try to hand him back the box of ""food"" and he begins to get agitated saying it was definitely lemongrass.  I said it surely was not.  Then he says ""Oh, you just don't know what lemongrass is, do you? I cook at the restaurant as well and I'm sure what you found is just lemongrass.""

Now I was angry. Probably from hearing the ""L"" word too many times.

I opened the box as he looked on, and began looking anew and in earnest through the ""food"".  Five seconds later, I found a tasty specimen of black hair clinging desperately to an even more desperate shrimp.  I pluck it from it's resting place, hand it to him and ask, ""So, you're telling me that this is lemongrass???  Although you say I have no idea what it is, I don't think it looks like a black disgusting hair in my food!""

First he looks a bit saddened with a low, ""huh"" escaping his lips. Then a pause.

He then handed me my 8 bucks and starts to talk energetically (with no apologies included though) about how he doesn't know...blah blah blah.

I again say that I just ordered it, his establishment should be investigated and shut down with that horrific of food preparation going on.

Please avoid this place (or at least take a good look at what you're eating)",2014-01-10 04:33:19
ar1JFyDqGXQa29WGJs0iKw,shn1jphO4QwvpcpgFa9MyQ,bLbjB2EeIQLFUS9ofKS-lw,4.0,3,0,1,"Regardless of the establishment, I would go back to Froyo solely for the owners (they are such a sweet couple!). But thankfully for them and Midwestern froyoaholics, the place rocks! The Storefront itself is bright and cheery. Patrons are greeted my a glowing sign and floor to ceiling glass windows, luring them into the froyo heaven. There is definitely a tangible aura to the place-I'm not sure if it's the green apple colored walls, the likes of Katy Perry booming from the speakers, or the combination. In a nutshell, the place is alarmingly reminiscent of Yogurtland, with a touch Pinkberry. Not exactly innovative (well maybe for the area), but definitely warm and hip. 

After the shock of candy colored walls wears off and you are able to fight through the throngs of sorority girls, you reach the backed tiled wall. Much like any self serve shop, under the 'how to' sign there is a small counter that houses the cups, which only come in two sizes-big and bigger. I overheard some costumers gripe about the monstrous cups, but once the toppings are in the mix I certainly had no complaints. To the right of the cups sit six, state-of-the-art Taylor machine, glimmering in the sea of blue and green glass tiles. The L-shaped walls (with two machines on one, and four on the other) do make it a bit of a struggle to maneuver, but overall the selections are impressive. The only froyo brand offered is Dannon YoCream (which seems to be taking over the world). The flavors do rotate, but I am not aware of a set schedule-it is more like when one runs out they refill it with a new flavor. Another small flaw, which I attribute to being new, is that at one point there were two tart options (an original and a Euro), yet no staple vanilla. Also, you are able to sample the flavors, but you have to ask for the sample cups and then you may get anywhere from one to seven. At least they don't fill the sample cups for you-I really hate when they do that at a self-serve place, and then watch you as you try it! 

On a positive note, I was around during the holidays and was pleased to see seasonal flavors, such as pumpkin pie (score!!!) and peppermint stick. The other flavor options that I noted over time were the two tarts, mango tart, alpine vanilla, cable car chocolate, dark chocolate, green tea, peanut butter, white chocolate macadamia nut, cookies and cream, chocolate mint, root bear float, and espresso. The bubble yum was, well, not yummy at all-please steer clear of that one. They also offer one NSA (like blueberry) or sorbet (like strawberry kiwi) flavor. Except for the tarts and sorbets, all the options are very creamy and extremely rich in flavor! The only issue I had was with the nutritional postings. The glass sign on the wall boasts 100 calories per 4 ounces, but I am confident that it does vary slightly among certain flavors. Also, it was a tad confusing as to which flavors contained trace fat, as some flavors like dark chocolate were labeled non-fat while others like peanut butter were without any label. Also, the froyo temperature was inconsistent at times, but mostly that was in the first month because they were so new. My favorite flavors there are the peanut butter, dark chocolate, cookies and cream, and pumpkin pie. Overall, quite divine!!! 

Now on to the toppings schmorgasboard. There is quite a range-candy to cereal-to fresh fruit-to appease any pallet. I do have to note that sometime the berries are frozen, which I find bitter and greatly unappetizing. But the other offerings are great-a range of syrups (think fudge, caramel, and marshmallow), mini marshmallows, sprinkles, chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, bananas, kiwi, huge cubes of cheesecake, and etc, etc, etc! One thing I found kinda odd was that they had a glass toppings sign on the wall behind the register, but it must have been made purely for decor purposes and  before they actually bought the toppings because it listed random things like grapes that clearly were no where to be seen. But, no biggy. The most notable topping by miles is the cookie dough. O-M-G. It is unbelievable!!! It looks and tastes like huge chunks of those circles of pre-formed Tollhouse dough balls. They are chilled, but still soft and chewy. Seriously, it has to be too good to be true (meaning that it IS the Tollhouse stuff, and therefore not egg-free), but I am more than willing to overlook that fact for the sake of my taste buds. 

Once you finish loading up at the toppings buffet, you find yourself at the register, complete with a little scale. At 39 cents an ounce, Froyo's froyo is pretty economical, although I do find myself 'conveniently' setting my purse in front of the scale screen as to shield the obscene weight and price from the other patrons' innocent eyes. On average, I end up paying between six and nine dollars, but hey, that's just me (or more accurately it's the hunk of cookie dough hiding in my cup!).

I would first like to say when I am heading into an Asian restaurant that of Japanese and Korean influence, I am hoping for some good seafood and exotic cuisine. For those who can complain about the pricing of Noboru and quality of the food, should probably re-group what they were really dining out for that night. Complaining about the sweet and sour chicken and fried rice at a sushi place, is kind of far fetched. And hearing that, I feel bad for the manager who actually had to listen through those complaints. I would not go to a well known steak house and order a salad and shrimp, but maybe that is just me. 

With that said, Noboru is a very fine place to dine whether it be a couple's night out, or a family gathering. It's great because the buffet offers high quality food for all taste buds. Plenty of dishes for vegetarians and vegans such as different salads, tofu and rolls, as well as enough meat such as kobe beef, shrimp, sashimi cuts, miso salmon, chicken, oysters etc. Our waiter was very polite, and helpful since it was our first time. He brought over to our table a broth fondue concoction, in which we were able to select different veggies like mushrooms, bokchoy, broccoli and shrimp/beef to cook at our table. I thought this was neat for it added a bit of ""Melting Pot Mojo"" to our asian buffet experience.

This was my first time at Noboru, and the fish was fresh. I would consider my family and I sushi lovers. We eat the eel, we eat the raw slices of fluke and tuna as well as the tobiko eggs and masago. Their fish is sliced thin (which I love for sashimi pieces), and the oysters sheckled right there can't get much fresher. I love oysters! And for those who are ticky tacky about the pricing, I don't understand where you are really coming from.

Other than IchiUmi in Edison NJ (I HIGHLY recommend), I haven't seen many sushi buffets around this area, at least to this standard. We had a nice time and great service. It was very clean, and for the amount of people there, the service was on point. (service in a buffet setting= plates cleared, glasses refilled, new utensils and napkins before we arrived with our second rounds to the table) I am looking forward to returning to Noboru next time in town.",2010-06-07 14:18:18
MHECb6clHIw4ZeX-GLoZNA,s3E93hhpZnkuAGQCsaOf9Q,OJEiB_a2I_gxC-ZeayI94A,1.0,6,0,0,"My office is located downtown and I've seen this cafe a few times but had never tried it before.  On June 29th, 2016 I decided to pop in to make a to-go order. Big mistake. 

Experience:
When I first walked in with my friend, I was instructed by the host to find a place at the bar so they could take my order. The place was empty so I figured we wouldn't have a long wait. After 10 minutes the bartender finally appears and begins to flirt around with a couple other bar patrons. She finally notices my friend and I and gives us menus so we can make an order. She continues to flirt around with other patrons, and a couple other people take seats at the bar and make order to eat in the restaurant. After 15 minutes Maddie delivers those people their food and takes my credit card that I had sitting in the payment booklet. When she brings back my card, she laughs saying ""I gave your card to those guys!"" (two men at the bar, they are laughing too making credit card fraud jokes) I just stared at her and the men and said, ""That's not funny at all"" and I take my card back. The men leave and still after 40 min my to-go order has not been delivered. We see Maddie looking frantic behind the bar, clearly she's wondering where my order is. She does a panicked run around, she'd probably forgotten to put my order into the kitchen or something between her flirting. I told my friend that I'm just going to leave despite already paying. I changed her tip on my credit card receipt to $1 from the original $3 I had left her on a $9.84 bill. About 5 min after I did this my friend and I get up from the bar to leave and here comes Maddie with my to-go bag. We say thanks and leave, muttering under our breath that we will never come back. 

Today, July 4th, I go to check my bank account so I can pay bills. I notice there are 5 separate credit card charges and cancelations on my card from 'Another Broken Egg Cafe' on June 29th, for various charges totaling to around $50. Thankfully my suspicions about Maddie's integrity led me to hang on to my receipts. I have proof of my order amount and you can even see my original total of $12.84 when I had left my original $3 tip. 

Credit card fraud is no laughing matter, and neither is accidentally handing one patrons card to another. It's understandable that little mixups can happen, but staff should never handle these situations as if it were a funny joke. If my card was swiped to pay someone else's bill and then cancelled, then of course charges and cancellations will be expected on my card statement; but to not inform me of this is just not good practice. This establishment needs to better educate their staff on these matters. 

Food: 
I got back to my office and was thinking well, hopefully the food will make up for the poor service. I opened the box and a nicely presented black bean burger with potatoes was a pleasant surprise. But, as expected, the food was just as terrible as their service. The burger had barely been cooked, it was more like a mound of smashed beans. Black bean burgers should be slightly crisp on the outside in order to hold their shape. The burger had a bland taste and combined with the mushy texture it was too disgusting to even choke down. The potatoes were just plain deep fried pieces. They weren't even seasoned, so nothing special there. The only highlight of the meal was a quarter of a dill pickle they had included lol

So if you've taken the time to read this, please do not waste your time going to Another Broken Egg Cafe. I had mistakenly thought it was a cute local restaurant, but it's actually a chain. Think of it like a more expensive version of IHOP. There are so many awesome places to go in downtown Nashville, DO NOT GO HERE. And even if you don't mind chains and just want a quick meal, DO NOT GO HERE.

*Edit* I actually wasn't going to take the time to even write a poor review of this place because I originally attributed the experience to Maddie's terrible service, but after seeing my credit card statement I figured it's best to inform the restaurant and others of how terrible this place is.",2016-07-04 18:29:29
rCMM-GMd4O6gFFsbrpxj1A,tNfzDAZcBcTpXLii9uMOGw,wrgtmWOkq1FwnlSgl6QcJg,4.0,3,0,1,"To borrow a phrase from my favorite Food Network Star... It's cocktail time!

We went to The Ball & Biscuit tonight! I must admit that I was a little nervous that the place would be super elitist, overcrowded, and just generally not my scene. As it turns out, I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong!

I think a lot of it had to do with our timing. My husband and I, along with our two best friends, got there a bit before 7. We had an early dinner, and wanted to keep the evening going for a little while longer. The place was basically empty, and we ended up sitting in what I think were the best seats in the house (four deep armchairs surrounding a low table). 

My husband and I, especially, had been wanting to give this place a go... He'd even pre-selected his first round cocktail (awww!); The Aviation Cocktail. I played it a bit safe, getting The Rooftop Cocktail. Our friends got The Claret Cup (which tasted A LOT like sangria) and the Cinnabar Negroni. We also got an order of bar nuts and some marinated olives. 

Our server was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about the cocktails, and answered all of our questions in detail... sometimes a bit more detail than was actually needed. But it was actually really nice. She was SUPER friendly and I'll take that over the alternative any day.

Our drinks and snacks came quickly after we ordered (which I'm sure was a result of the place not being busy at all). We all sampled all of the drinks, and decided that they were ALL pretty awesome. Sometimes there is a bit of jealousy at who ordered what and what we wish we had ordered instead, but I think we were all pretty pleased with our selections. :) We sat back and enjoyed our delicious beverages while talking and laughing.

After a while, we decided to get a second round, and we all mostly tried a different drink. This time my husband got the Sazerac, I got The Grand Marnier Smash, and our friends got the Hemingway Daiquiri and The Rooftop (because he liked mine so much).

All of the drinks were beautiful and surprisingly tasty. I'm not a big drinker at all, and I managed to find two cocktails that suited my tastes. It is kind of sad to report that those two drinks left me with a serious buzz... The force is STRONG with their drinks, indeed.

We all decided that we'd hit our wall at two drinks, and settled up. Our tab (which included four of their classic cocktails, the bar nuts, and the marinated olives) came to about 45 dollars plus tip. Some people might scoff at paying 10 bucks for a cocktail, but it's pretty much right in line with what one should expect to pay for for a designer drink.  

One previous reviewer had it just right. They are a lot like art in a glass and you pay for the privilege. Between the four of us, we managed to hit most of the items on their menu, and all of them were kind of amazing.

As far as the vibe of the lounge itself... The decor is awesome (as I'm sure many reviewers before me have mentioned). It's very laid back and casual, with sofas and chairs as well as some traditional tables. I hate to use the word chic, but it's totally that. It was definitely a comfortable place to spend a couple hours.

As a completely random side note... I also used the bathroom while I was there. It was super clean and nice and even managed to smell good... which is kind of a big deal for me. No one wants to use a gross bathroom! Am I right? I know I'm right. :)

Another (random) great thing! No smoking! Just thought I would mention that in case it's an issue either way. Personally, smoke gives me a headache and just generally makes me grumpy, so I'm happy to be without... But perhaps you like to smoke when you drink... And if so, this is not the place for you!  :P

If you have any inclination to do so, I would absolutely recommend visiting The Ball & Biscuit. There is a discernible lack of pretentiousness, and the drinks are phenomenal. It's definitely a good time to be had by all.

**We were also told that they are getting ready to roll our their new Fall drink menu in the next week or two. Our waitress recommended that we check their Facebook page for updates, which we totally plan on doing. She gave us a brief rundown of some of the new drinks coming out... and they definitely sound exciting.  :)",2010-11-14 04:38:37

Indianapolis has redeemed itself on ""cajun"" in my mind after that ridiculous Papa Roux attempt at what they called a po boy.
I read about this place in Nuvo and knew that I needed to try them. It sounded like the  owner was putting in a solid effort to be a real po boy shop.
And I love seeing a new place in Fountain Square. If only Indy had good transit between Downtown and Fountain Square, and we could ferry some of the chain-going hoards in Downtown out there. Such a great area.
This is addressed Shelby, by their parking lot is accessed from the alley behind Shelby, and there's no street parking out front. They have a nice patio that faces the street, a bocce ball court, a few tables in the interior, and even a bar. Yeah, they have good, local beer on tap. It's not cheap, but it's good and it's local. If you want cheap, they have $2 pints of PBR.
And this is not a cheap place to eat at either. You're going to be paying roughly the French Quarter or Parasols prices for your po boy. They serve halves and fulls, with fulls starting at about $8. They have a variety of sides, including red beans & rice. The price is worth it. Really.
They have a number of different po boys, including shrimp, oyster, roast beef and andouille sausage. They also do lunch specials, where they have a half of the non-seafood po boys plus a side for something like $8. Really not bad.
I had the catfish po boy. I can't resist catfish, even in Indiana. Looking at the menu, and listening to them talk about the menu, I was really impressed. #1: they have what Louisianans call the hot sausage po boy. Here though called it a spicy sausage po boy (it's not really that spicy). But it's still what it is. #2: they serve the roast beef po boy correctly, with brown gravy. I think this po boy is gross, honestly, but that's the way it's supposed to be done. My catfish was $11 for the full, and I got a side of red beans & rice. Also can't resist that.
The catfish was nice. I mean, it was frozen, but where are you going to get fresh catfish in Indiana? Fried chunks of it, with a good breading. The sandwich bread itself was very good. I was most impressed with the red beans & rice though, I think. A little overboard on the beans to rice ratio, in terms of beans, but it had a really nice flavor. I don't normally like it when they try to get fancy and throw other stuff in there or spice it up (that's what hot sauce is for), but I can't knock this stuff. It's very good. No need for hot sauce this time.
They also had Crystal hot sauce on the table, which is a big plus since that's what you see on tables in Louisiana a lot of times (Tabasco is expensive, even there). So I had my catfish dry, but added the hot sauce. Very good eatin'.
Best po boy ever? No, but that's a tall order. It beats a lot of what I've had in New Orleans though, and even some of the places in Houston.
Like I said, great addition to the area. I'll definitely be back to try some of their other offerings.",2012-09-12 19:36:59
Q8YAcNB4CYDtHx-8WGeLvA,9erhTlkzCr5MtKXeFqOrcg,Z3rj8aJKHP6soxiXP07e_A,1.0,0,0,0,"This Home Depot barely gets one star and that is for the nice ""greeter"" lady at the door. Other than that, the management of this store should be utterly embarrassed of themselves. I am definitely never shopping at a Home Depot again. They run good adds on TV but beware of the reality of their non-existent customer service and product knowledge. 

My Mother decided to have the carpet in her home replaced with a hardwood product. After picking out the product, we did our ""due diligence"" by having a Home Depot representative come to the home and do measurements and verify the product was appropriate for the home. After charging over $4000 for the purchase of this product and waiting for nearly two months for delivery and an installation appointment, the installer (contracted by Home Depot) informed us that the product was not appropriate for the home. This information also came after they ripped up the current carpet leaving only plywood floors. 

They installer informed us of another product that would be appropriate for this home. The installer also said that we should keep the current molding but the order was several feet short. We returned to the store to have them pick up the useless product, let them know the shorted us on the molding, and purchase the new product. Since the new product was less expensive we also decided to purchase a new door which we were told could be placed on the same order and delivered with the new flooring. Even the we left the store being told everything was OK, they made something as easy as an additional purchase be a long drawn out production and we had to eventually purchase the door separately. 

After all of this we were told the additional molding was ordered and we still had a nearly $400 credit on our account. The molding was never ordered and the credit disappeared somewhere.  Even though we had already paid a delivery charge for the product they should never had sold us, they charged us the exact amount of our credit as a delivery charge for the new product.

One of my favorite situations in this whole debacle was when my 73 year old  mother was at the service desk and the ""manager"" hid behind the screen which separates him from the desk and was either too indifferent or too scared to deal with a very serious customer service issue. 

My mother lived in her home for nearly two months with plywood floors. When it finally came time for the installer to come and install the new product, once again, we were told the product was not suitable for this home. My mother eventually had to go back to the store and sign off on something to void the warranty on the product in order to get her flooring installed. Of course he could not finish the project because we were missing molding that was never ordered. When it was finally ordered we were told that we would receive a phone call when it came in, of course, such call never came. 

This is clearly a management issue. The employees on the floor were nice enough and tried but clearly had not been trained properly and have no leadership.

Find a friend with a car or use a reputable car rental service. Do not be lured in by their illusion of affordability and convenience. DO NOT USE GETAROUND. I tried Getaround for the first time in order to drive to an important interview and it was a complete failure.

Getaround reps moved me to three different vehicles, in three different locations, I didn't end up receiving access to any vehicle, and am now being insulted by one of their ""customer service"" reps, Gabriel via email.

1st car - The owner did not provide proper notice that the car was unavailable for driving, so when I arrived, I was unable to unlock the car even when the app told me that it was unlocked.

2nd car - A Getaround representative moved me to this vehicle at a separate location but failed to notice that car battery was completely dead. So, after taking a Lyft(an unexpected cost) to a second Getaround location, I was met with another non-working vehicle after the first Getaround vehicle did not work out.

3rd car- Yet another Getaround representative directed me to a third Getaround vehicle at a different parking garage. The app did not allow me to unlock the vehicle and I had to call Getaround again to unlock it for me. When I was finally able to access the car, it was dirty, the fuel was not filled, and the dashboard indicated that require maintenance needed to be completed.

I was starting to get really upset with the whole situation because I was more time was passing and I had an interview to get to! I had to call Getaround for the 4th time and was told by Gabriel that Getaround would reimburse my lyft/uber costs (so I could at least make it to my interview late) and provide $40 credit for inconveniencing me. What he failed to mention was that the ""reimbursement"" was contingent on the original amount I was going to spend with my original Getaround vehicle. So when I sent him my 3 lyft receipts: 

1) For unexpectedly having to travel to a second location. ($8.38)
2) My trip to my interview location. ($55.56)
3) My trip back from my interview location. ($54.40)

I wasn't expecting to be told after the fact, that he could only reimburse one of the receipts and that the $40 credit was supposed to go towards renting one of Getaround's vehicles directly after my interview. (Photos 1&2 of what he emailed after the conversation)

For having to deal with Getaround for over 2.5 hours, running across town to make it to vehicles that were not in working order, and being rushed to an important interview, I did not believe I was making an unreasonable request to have all of my receipts reimbursed. 

I've attached a few email exchanges between Gabriel and I and the ISSUE IS STILL NOT RESOLVED. I haven't responded to his last email(Photos 5&6), because it is the most ridiculous email I've ever received from a customer service rep and I don't even know how to respond. But he's decided to close the support ticket.",2019-09-14 21:14:08

First off, my husband and I absolutely love the food, HOWEVER every time we have gone to take out, she has the most disgusting attitude, I have no idea why we thought the customer service would somehow get better each time we visit, but nothing changes. This experience I just had will be the last time I ever give this place ANY business. I called to place an order for pick up, after my order I expected her to give me an estimated time as to when my food will be ready, that didn't happen, she just hung up the phone on me after my order. I own a restaurant myself, so I had a few things to take care of before I headed out to Tara's. I showed up 20 mins later and I walked in and walked over to the counter to try to tell her I was there to pick up a call in order I had placed, she looked CONFUSED at first and then proceeded to give me the most DISGUSTING attitude and shouted ""How long ago you called"" I said 20 mins ago, she rolled her eyes and said ""No it was over 30 mins"" (which was not at all true I even showed her my call log) all the customers turned and looked at me and were chuckling as if they got a kick out of her snapping on me with that attitude of hers. I felt humiliated even though I had no reason to. She asked me what I ordered, I told her 2 doubles plus what ever else I said over the phone, she took NO TIME TO LISTEN TO ME, 5 mins later she walks out the kitchen with ONLY 2 doubles and not the rest of my order. I almost wanted to walk out and not take anything from her. I proceeded to tell her I had more to my order, she gave me the most disgusting look like I just ruined her life and told me she doesn't remember talking to me on the phone and she doesn't remember anyone ordering what I ordered. I don't understand how she gets away with talking to her customers so nasty and treats them like complete CRAP. I was willing to give YOU MY HARD EARNED MONEY because I enjoyed the food. But after her attempting to put me on the spot in front of all her customers over something SHE did wrong I would never step food in there again, NOR will I continue recommending her to my customers.",2018-09-03 21:17:16

Carmike Hickory 8 is just like any other mainstream theater you might find in a Chicago suburb. I did want to leave a quick note and talk about how the service was over the phone. Being part of the Courtyard at Hickory Hollow Mall, Siri got confused and kept taking us in circles around the mall itself, and we were unable to find the theater's exact location. It's set back far enough from the street and it doesn't seem to stand tall enough for you to find it easily. If you're familiar with Hawthorn Mall in Vernon Hills, IL, then you'll understand exactly how this theater is in relation to the rest of the mall. It's not really part of the mall, it's next to the mall. When I called Carmike, the lady on the phone did not know how to give me directions. Once she understood that I was from Chicago, I could easily sense I was being passed off with an attitude that said, ""I'm not dealing with this."" The other lady was pleasant, asking us to find our way back to Bell Road, from where we were able to stumble upon the theater on the way there.
What I thought was weird, there was a giant screen in front of the hallway that lead to the individual theaters, which posted times for the movies, and when they were about to run. Like an airport posting arrivals and departures, these signs did the same. They would actually instruct you whether or not to wait until the movie was ready to be seated or if it was still on standby. I couldn't imagine this location getting so busy to the point where Carmike needed a lit sign to direct traffic.
The seating was pretty good considering most places you go. I felt like the seats were better cushioned and slightly wider. The layout positioned the seats on the sides of the theater so that they were angled toward the screen. It wasn't Icon theater in Chicago, but it was much better than what I am used to seeing. Since my travel partner and I were a little lost, we ran about 10 minutes late to the movie. In Nashville, the movies start exactly when they say they do. They must have started with the previews early enough so that the movie was ready to run exactly on time. Apparently there's lots of riff raff that goes on here. I noticed security guards pacing around outside. I even had to push one of them out of the way with the glass door so that I could exit the theater. I threw him a disgusted, ""Excuse me,"" so that this well-fed southerner would get out of my way. All in all my experience was average. If you want to watch a movie, come here. It's also cheap! I think I paid all of $2.50 for my venture ""Into The Darkness."" Go Nashville!",2013-08-15 10:20:39

What a disappointment.  If I could give 0 stars I would. The service was horrible from the beginning.  I guess when you know gratuity is added automatically you don't have to provide good service.  We had to order things two or three times to get them. We ordered appetizers that came with two corn tortillas  (not enough for the queso fundido) so I ordered more and never got them. The waitress tried to take it with only two scoops gone. My brother had to order more tortillas since I never got the original order and she seemed like she had no idea I ordered them. I informed her of my allergy to avocado and she wrote nothing down just said my plate didn't come with it. I explained that nothing that has touched avocado could touch my plate. Again she wrote nothing down. 45 minutes later we had our food.  My plate came with avocado on it. Another server brought it I explained and he took it away. I also explained not to just take it off the plate. 5 minutes later I had a replacement plate. Worried that it wasn't remade I asked the server. She assured me it was remade. How they cooked food so fast worried me, but I tried it. The food had no flavor and was barely warm. Half way through my enchilada my mouth started itching and the inside of my mouth started forming bumps (part of my allergy). When I told the waitress she didn't apologize just said she'd tell the manager.  The Manager removed it from my bill and told me of his shell fish allergy.  Acting like it wasn't a big deal until I explained my through has closed before and I had to go to the hospital.  He said he watched my food be remade and that the cook must have touched avocado before making my plate. Not good practice either way. My son's carne asada burrito was a piece of steak rolled in a tortilla.  The paella was so salty and only tasted of chorizo. Couldn't tell what sea food was in it and the portion was so small for a 19.00 plate. The best thing I tried was the taquito con papa. Other than that don't waste your time.  Oh and the big issue we got served chips and no salsa. What Mexican restaurant does that and if you are used to guadalajara grill you know they are known for their table side salsa. So we waited then finally asked. Her response, ""oh you want to order salsa?"" Yes of course. That's when I read the menu and discovered that salsa is 7.95, but after 5 you get one free. Well woth a table of 9 we needed more. It's a small portion of the size including tip 12.95 for about 1/2 a cup of salsa. After my complaint we were not offered a dessert menu. Guess they wanted us to just leave because we were then given our check.  We will not ever return.",2015-09-13 19:47:07
JmG2Ad8YgNfuWxXcPvsEcg,EFw9r83RQGk-ei3NR09K7A,M1hsyjJDdQQeNP164FJ1pA,5.0,18,9,11,"I absolutely LOVE St. James. In fact, I love it SO much that I wish I could just move to the area so I could walk there every weekend for a bit of wine, cheese and charcuterie on a regular basis.

When I REALLY love a place for such a variety of reasons, I feel it is usually best that I just break it down in a list of numerical fashion. Sort of like when middle school girls gather together to compile a strategic list of all their grand expectations of adulthood.

1) The price is right. Cheese Board prices are as follows: 3 - $12.50, 5 - $17.50, 7 - $23.50, 10 - $30.00 and you can make as many customizations as you would like. Don't like blue cheeses or strong cheeses? That's fine. Just let them know and they will customize a cheese plate to your liking. Want to experiment with some more pungent cheeses or have an affinity for a specific type of goat cheese? They will customize that too! The cheese boards also are accompanied with a sliced bread basket, charcuterie, and a variety of tasting paraphernalia like mustard, pickles, jam, olives, honey coated walnuts, grapes, etc. I find the prices here to be much more modest and the portions to be a lot more generous compared to most other wine and cheese bars in the city.

2) I love how all the cheese and charcuterie boards are all different. The person next to you might also have a 5 cheese and charcuterie board, but chances are, it doesn't look just like yours. This keeps each experience a little fresh and new because you are always being served a rotational variety of cheeses. 

3) The deli. My notoriously favorite sandwich is the IL MOSTRO with spicy capicola, rosemary ham, rosa salami, provolone, pickled red onions, herb/pepperoncini mayo, lettuce, tomato on a Bellegarde ciabatta. They hand slice all their meats right there in front of you so it's fresh every time. Nothing is pre-made here. They also have a side salad with a ceasar-like dressing that's just so simple, but just so good. Which brings me to my 4th point...

4) St. James is unpretentious. Plenty of other wine and cheese bars might be nice but they tend to usually give me a sense that I probably don't know enough about exotic cheeses and wine pairings to create the most optimal experience for myself or for a group of people. I hate feeling like I'm undeserving of some sort of worldly and complicated cheese and wine expectation. St. James on the other hand does all the work for you. They pair you a great variety of cheeses and tasting accessories, and you just experiment as you go while enjoying the no pressure ambiance. If you are a cheese lover but don't know a whole lot about what cheeses are what, this is a great place to experiment and the staff is really helpful at explaining everything they picked out for you so you can keep track. On the other hand, if you don't really care about how rare the Dutchland goat cheese is that was stored for 2 years in an oak barrel before they carefully shipped it to your restaurant by way of religious monks....don't worry, there's no test afterwards and they won't give a lecture on it unless you really want lots of detail.

5) Enclosed outdoor and patio seating. The outdoor seating is intimate with big umbrellas and often very shady due to the small space between buildings. Dogs are welcome to join outside but it doesn't ever turn into a big crowded dog park/bar situation like you would find at Bull Dog. I love sitting outside here, even during the hotter months since it is so shady. The atmosphere is very laid back and will invite you to stay far longer than you anticipated. The pace gets a bit more packed during lunch time so if you want to stay a good long while and get an outdoor seat, try coming on a weekend or at an off-hour.

I find it optimal to share a bottle of wine and split a cheese board amongst good company. Often I'll even order a sandwich to-go for later on. Perfect for catching up with friends over lunch or as an early-in-the-day social meet up spot before going elsewhere.",2015-07-02 03:19:34

I get it, most people only come here with a complaint, not a compliment, so you take these reviews with a grain of salt, but you need to take a moment to really consider why their rates are so cheap if you agree to a three year plan. Colonial will find an excuse to deny everything. 

For me... A/C breaks... they don't cover freon or stop leak tests... so you pay for it and they find out it's the motor, which they do cover... but then they don't because they said I don't have a history of regular maintenance. That was my recent experience. Never had this experience in 11 years with other warranty companies. I just cancelled my three year Colonial plan.... taking a big hit and getting only a fraction back.... to go with another company. Colonial is like having no plan, so I had to choice. 

Are you having your A/C, dryer, washer, refrigerator and other appliances attended to by a professional with regular maintenance and can show the records for it? Then expect that they will deny you as well.

Likewise, my home is a rental property, and this is what my proper manager said about her first experience with Colonial:

""I called your warranty company and spoke to a Robert.  He was unable to give me the vendor name, he was unable to give me a turn around time for contacting the tenants even though this is considered an emergency, and he was unable to take down the tenant contact information. The only 2 things he could provide was that a $55.00 trade call fee is due prior to the a/c vendor entering the dwelling.  The warranty company does not collect the trade call fee.  Since he could not tell me what vendor he is assigning it to, you will have to contact them directly.  Obviously, the tenant is not responsible for the fee, and the vendor will not enter the property until this is paid.  The second thing he could provide is a claim number of XXXXX. I suggest when your policy is up for renewal, you go with a different home warranty company.  I deal with several, and this is the only home warranty company I have ever run across that was completely unable to help or assist in any way. Please call them, and pay the $55.00.  Since they refused to take the tenants contact information, I will give it to you.""

I believe that says it all.",2013-07-10 17:21:12

This is the worst place to have your event for a guest of honor if they have a food allergy. My surprise bridal shower was held here and it was made known that I have a food allergy with garlic on several occasions before this place was booked by my sister and mother whom I trust most in my life. They said they accommodate food allergies, well they DID NOT! The buffet was set up, and IF I HAD NOT SPECIFICALLY ASKED to double check if there was any garlic in the food, this could have turned out so bad. I was told that there is definately garlic in at least two of the dishes, but oh are you the bride, we have a separate meal for you?!? I had to wait for my food to be made and all I, THE GUEST OF HONOR, received was a plate of grilled chicken and steamed vegetables. It may have been accommodating to other guests attending if they had a food allergy, but while everyone is eating the specific meal that was requested to be garlic free for me for MY shower, by my family, which included roast beef, stuffed shells, mashed potatoes, vegetables and salmon I am eating a plate of grilled chicken. The menu was picked because the food (minus garlic) is everything I like to eat, not chicken. Garlic is able to be left out if all your food is freshly prepared on site. I was not given an option of what I could have, except to ask if salt and pepper was ok. We brought this to the attention of the manager Genie who will probably be reading this, after our guests left, because we had to attend to them and our party. Genie, the manager would not stop interrupting us when we were voicing our concern. She was very loud and nasty and defensive and her response was ""this has never happened before and told us the chef could have remade the buffet in 20 minutes without the ingredient"" which is a lie. This should have been done per the request from the beginning and per our contract. Our contract stated that the bride has a garlic allergy. This is extremely serious, food allergies should be taken more seriously, they are not just an allergy if injested. Food allergies are also airborne, so even if you remade the food, the entire rooms were already filled with the smell of garlic, that was to be left out. Airborne allergies can have a reaction such as hives, lethargy, anaphylactic, needing an EpiPen or ambulance, IBS, diarrhea, vomiting, sensitive to light, headache, nausea, nothing pleasant for the GUEST OF HONOR! You made the decision to include the ingredient in all of the prepared food and not verify the type of allergy was FULLY accomodated. Just as peanuts and gluten are allergies, so is garlic, it is part of the allium family of foods. It may not be a common allergy but it was noted and my family was under the impression that the ingredient was going ro be left out of the entire meal. If it is requested to not have an ingredient by the ones booking and your food can not be made with out it then, YOU need to notify the patrons booking your facility or come up with a menu to accommodate their wishes and guest of honor allergy. If you can not accommodate the menu picked or come to terms with a menu that is suitable, then part separate ways or allow them to bring in their own food. Don't be selfish to keep the booking while making all of the food with the allergin, to potentially have a worst case scenario reaction noted above. It was made known that if the food could not be made without the garlic, that my family will book another facility. No where was it stated or made aware to us that I would be getting a separate plate that was not even the food chosen. I did not get any thing from the menu we picked, garlic free. I got chicken which was not on the menu that my family chose. I hope the next person will receive better service and more attention to food allergy than we did or just not book your facility to be safe. It's beyond ridiculous that we even had to pay for any of the food since it was not prepared as requested. Also rediculous that your staff takes it all home after the events. You are worried about soda going to waste, but not all the excess food because your staff gets it. Hopefully you enjoyed the garlic filled food we paid for, that we asked to be garlic free.  HVAC doesnt work on 90 deg days and server forgets things.    Thank you for ruiening my once in a lifetime event",2019-08-20 00:22:25

So, that should mean great service, right? Except our waitress was the only one taking orders, and right away she told us she was new. Now, I can forgive someone for not being at the top of their game on their first couple of days at a new job, but she was painfully slow, made us repeat our order several times, and didn't know the menu at all. Did she really need to spend 30 seconds writing down ""The Veggie"" all nice and neat? You better learn to use shorthand fast, girlie! But still, she was new, so I can give her some slack.

What I can't forgive is the ridiculous wait time for our food. I didn't time it, but it took at least 30 minutes, possibly even 40-45. And when it was ready, our waitress was sitting at a table in the corner on her cell phone, and we had to go up and ask if we could get our food now since we could see it sitting on the counter and by this point we were salivating. AND they forgot my cheeseburger, so I had to wait an additional seven or so minutes for that to come out. Once we got the food, it was decent, but at this point I was so mad I didn't care.

After devouring our food in ten seconds flat, we decided to order dessert to go. The restaurant had three options, and our waitress immediately told us they were out of one of them - cannolis. AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT OUT OF CANNOLIS? And who the heck was eating them - by this time we were the only people there! So, we ordered New York style cheesecake with raspberry topping. When I got home and opened my box, I realized my cheesecake had absolutely no raspberry topping and was as plain as could be. Grrrrrr.

To top this night off, not only did they not give us anything off for the burger mishap or the delayed service, but they charged us 18% gratuity for a table of FOUR. What the heck?! Has anyone ever heard of anything like this before? It did not say that automatic gratutity would be charged anywhere on the menu. What the menu did have, by the way, was the website domain for the restaurant, which doesn't actually work. Figures.",2014-09-26 03:27:35

The 9:00 appointment was pushed off by the office when the oral surgeon walked into the office at 9:15 leaning on the receptionist counter yawning. This prompted the initial feeling of uneasiness. He then disappeared into the back and I waited patiently until approximately 9:40 before asking the young lady behind the desk when I would be seen. The woman told me I would be seen ""hopefully within the next 20-25 minutes."" I then explained that I did not understand why it would be over an hour after my appointed time. In response, she informed me that they scheduled three people to see the oral surgeon at 9:00. This did not sit well with me; I was not just having a routine check-up, I was having my first surgery with nothing but Novocain done by an oral surgeon that was last seen yawning and now appeared to be extremely unprofessional. I told the woman I would return in 20 minutes since there is a store nearby and I wished to purchase my post operation foods. When I reached the door, she stood up and shouted at me, ""if you leave and we call your name you won't be seen you cancelled your appointment."" With that being said, I told them I would be seeking dental care elsewhere. I am a grown woman also in the business field and do not appreciate being spoken to condescendingly, shouted at from across a crowded business office, and am well aware that is not how to treat clients. 
My family has had many problems with this office also and so far from every website review I have come across many other people have. 
I also tried to retrieve my X-rays because I was able to make a new consultation somewhere else that same day and they refused to give them to me in time and wanted to charge me. A few days later they sent me a letter refusing to treat my family and I ever again and calling me unprofessional. My family had nothing to do with this mess and I had already sought a new dentist. The letter was ridiculous, rude, and unnecessary. 
I was angry I paid for a 5 minute consultation with an unprofessional office and then had to argue for my X-rays. Going to my new oral surgeon, Westwood Oral Surgeons, was a breath of fresh air ! They were absolutely amazing there! Nothing like the frowning faces you see behind the desk and Deptford Family Dental and the unprofessional dentists and surgeons.
Needless to say I have since filed a formal complaint and sent it to their corporate office, the BBB, and the NJ Board of Dentistry. I advise that everyone who has issues with this office do also. Posting these reviews is an awesome way to warn others of how terribly unprofessional this office is, but we obviously need to file formal complaints too because that office should NOT be in business any longer.",2011-05-05 19:16:46

Let me say up front that I am giving this place 3 stars based on my first visit, earlier tonight; I reserve the right to upgrade it after my next visit. I hear that the lunch buffet is their strong suit; I was there for a very average dinner tonight. Long story short the food is adequate but falls short of both the hype about this place and of the best Indian food you've likely had. My wife and I did not experience the depth of flavors and complexity of spices that we find in places like Taj Mahal and Swagat in Kansas City.  Like many, I was intrigued after hearing that a supposedly great Indian restaurant could be found, of all places, atop an airport motel. Even the location was mysterious based on the cryptic information in the reviews I read. [Folks, the GPS address is 4534 Long Rd. Bridgeton, MO 63044, 11th floor of the Airport Plaza Inn. It's really easy to get to once you know that there's no actual entry from Lindbergh...The property is off Natural Bridge, effectively ""behind"" Lindbergh.] Anyway, I give it 3 stars because the food was good -- not bad -- but unremarkable. I was expecting greatness based one some of the reviews. I love Indian food; since I can't afford to travel to India, I settle for eating Indian food in most cities I visit. India Palace rates in the middle of the pack. I had the tomato soup appetizer (sweeter than savory but good) and the Chicken Tikka Masala entree. My wife had the Chicken Saag. The sauce on my dish was especially rich and buttery, which is a good thing IMHO...It just was way too salty and could have benefited from some fresh herbs to brighten it. The Saag dish was even more bland. So, the food was very pedestrian. But despite the odd location and sketchy motel parking lot, the actual restaurant space is especially well-appointed...Almost to the extreme. With pink napkins decoratively placed atop faux white tablecloths, my wife said the place was laid out more like a bridal shower than a restaurant. And despite the ubiquitous young men running around in ties and vests, the service was rather perfunctory...nothing special. All in all, I say that this place isn't bad if you have a taste for Indian Food....just temper your expectations and don't believe all of the hype.",2014-07-06 04:49:59

The Econo Lodge 187 US 130 & 206 in Bordentown, NJ. This hotel is nothing short of disgusting. We stayed the night anyways, due only to the fact that we checked in at a very late hour and simply had to sleep somewhere.


I photoed the below described items and attached them for your review.


The exterior security doors of the hotel had been smashed from its latches and simply left in that condition without any repair attempts. Nothing beats the first impression, this place looks unsafe.


The exterior balcony walkway to our room (#216) was chipped and rotting. Hunks of pavement/stucco/goo littered the path. A used dental floss pick lay on the ground next to my room's doorway. Very nasty, but easy enough to hose down and scrub, a little effort here would make a huge difference.


Entering the room made things worse. The room stank of mildew and filth. The carpet was stained from the doorway all the way through the whole room. To top of the flooring issue, a 1"" lip in the carpet at the entryway made me trip while walking with my suitcases.


All three chairs in the room are covered with stain specimens of unknown origin. DON'T sit down....


The bedspread was no better. It had obviously not been laundered in some time and was stained with something that I prefer to push from my imagination. At least was not too cold, since the air conditioning was functioning poorly.


Yeah, the air-conditioning was technically operating. But the exposed electrical wires hanging from it to the floor made it clear to me that touching the device was ill-advised. I left the damned thing alone.


I snapped some photos of the generally filthy walls. The all need to be wiped down with a scrub pad and a little bit of 409 spray cleaner. Trust me folks, most of that grime really will wipe right off. I also recommend patching the holes in the walls with a little bit of spackling compound, followed up by a light sanding and paint to match. Somebody tried to patch a hole on the wall next to the toilet paper roll, but obviously did not even try to complete the job. It was troweled white plaster, un-sanded and unpainted. It looks like something I might have done in 5th grade.


Well since we're in the bathroom.... The lighting was just two florescent tubes and the fixture metal base. No plastic lens and (shockingly) more exposed electrical wiring. I will exit the bathroom immediately after showering in the morning to avoid the potential of steam condensation creating an electrical circuit between the bare wires and my body. On second thought, I won't be taking a shower since the bath towels on the rack are soiled with some unidentified red and yellow stains. Yup, both towels - absolutely disgusting.


I suppose that forgoing the shower is just well since I wouldn't dream of touching the hair dryer on the wall. Its handle is coated in black finger goo. This could be wiped off in about six seconds if the cleaning crew gave a damn. And fix the friggin toilet handle!


The one and only thing that I can say about this hotel is that the night manager, Erick, was very polite and helpful during check-in.


So, check out the photos and update your web site to include this review. I tried to submit it on the Booking web page but it would not let me. This hotel is an abomination and it's condition violates every basic principle of hotel management. The general manager of this hotel should be fired without delay.

As a follow up, the next morning I spoke with the desk clerk and told her about the horrific conditions of the hotel rooms. She said, ""It's an economy hotel, you didn't have to stay here last night."" She then refused to provide her name or any identification when i told her I was going to report her response to the hotel manager. I took a photo of the lobby and the staff at the front desk, she then yelled ""You're pathetic!""

I am preparing a report to file with New Jersey Bureau of Housing Inspection.",2016-06-29 23:57:16

If you want a truly unique experience with regard to ambiance and creative cocktails of every sort, THIS is your place.  Once you actually FIND the building (an unassuming grey house across from a hotel), you are greeted by the host in front of a velvet curtain, that he will slide back with a flourish to grant you entrance into the intimate interior of Patterson House.

The bar itself is warm and friendly, the tables are cozy and well-appointed.  Gentle hum of chatter among fellow patrons replaces the ubiquitous faces-glued-to-cellphones that most bars are full of these days.  There's too much to look at and enjoy here for you to waste your time in the glow of your phone.  It's actually officially discouraged here (though texting at the bar is okay).  TALK to your friends.  Like IN PERSON.  What a concept. :)

First tip:   Bring your reading glasses to read the menu (the aforementioned ambiance includes dim, sexy lighting).  

The cocktail menu is divided by main alcohol components (i.e., whiskey, vodka).  There are some truly creative and complex mixtures here, sure to satisfy any enthusiast of mixology.  And your server is very well versed in the flavor profiles and what might appeal to your individual palate.  When in doubt if you'll dig it, ASK.

Second tip:  If you're expecting food of the same calibre as the libations, you will be disappointed.  I was actually surprised at the oddball offerings...tater tots, a really salty burger was what we had.  But I was starving and had to line my stomach before it was assaulted with this amazing level of alcohol.

Suggestions to TPH:  Step up your food game.  Figured they didn't have a grill, based on their menu (and as a former restaurant owner, I totally get that limitation), but my thoughts were things like figs stuffed with goat cheese, prosciutto-wrapped melon, a decent charcuterie board and the like, would have been amazing accompaniments to the cocktails.  Even interesting crusty breads with herbed oils would have been far more pleasing.  And MUSIC: Super classy cool place...but the music was all over the place.  Both my coworker and I thought a piano would have been a better choice...old school charm.  I know it's hard to find a piano player these days, but how fitting it would be in this joint. :)  But even minus the piano, more classic (not classical) music...Rat Pack...etc. would have fused with the vibe of the rest of the place.

Overall, if you want old school charm, super creative cocktails for every palate, meet some truly interesting people at the bar and sexy lighting for date night, don't miss TPH.  We will definitely be back on the next trip to Nashville.  :)",2019-04-04 14:13:14

We were excited that the place is pet friendly as we just came from the beach with our furry friend.  We were greeted with a smile at the host stand and walked around outside to the back deck seating for our afternoon Happy Hour excursion.

The ambiance and atmosphere is great with an awesome view of the bay.

Our server came over quickly and greeted us.  We informed her that it was our first time there and asked about happy hour and beer specials.  She informed us that the draught beer system is currently down and she would have to check what the specials were.  We ordered the Bluebird Margarita and a Pacifico until she should come back and inform us what other options there were for happy hour with regards to beer.  I had to ask for a lime, that she eventually brought back but the limes were dried out.  While she was gone, we overheard another server mention the happy hour specials, also informing guests that the draught system was down for now but that they could get Corona Light bottles on happy hour.  When we asked our server about that when she came back, she still said there were no beer specials.  Anyway, we continued to order.

For appetizers we ordered the coconut crusted shrimp and the ceviche martini.  The coconut shrimp was fantastic.  The ceviche martini was tasty but could of used a little more heat in my opinion.  Also, it only came with 5 rice crackers.  It would have been nice to have more of those to put the ceviche on.

We ordered the grouper sandwich and a couple sushi rolls for our entrees.  The server must have gotten busy because she disappeared for a while and we had to ask the runner for tartar sauce for the very dry fish sandwich, and beer refills.  The eel cucmber was really good and a great value.  The Big Kahuna tempura roll had way too much batter on it and it was super crispy, hard to eat.

We ordered the rum soaked banana bread for desert and it was by far the best part of the meal.

Overall, we had a great time after our time at the beach but the service and attention to detail is definitely questionable.  It is more of a $$$ price point rather than a $$ as listed on Yelp.

The view was great, and we'll go back to give it another go, hopefully they have the beer issue worked out by then.",2016-06-03 02:09:14
W2Sv2eakmiPyOEmbWyMocA,skocLTy_U9OIpKOSGj5Gjg,B9txxpWS2NP4SMhC3AdSug,1.0,0,0,0,"I have been a LONG time customer at Mungenast. Bought my 2006 Honda there and have ONLY had it serviced there. I was always satisfied. But my most recent experience is such that I will NOT take my car back there and will NOT buy my next car there.

There was a recall for the paint on the roof of the 2006 Hondas. It took 6 months to get an appointment. Then it wasn't until I was ready to bring it in that they informed me that they'd have the car for at least a week and that they would not pay for a rental while they had my car. I fussed about this to enough people that they agreed to pay for a rental.

There were a ton of other minor issues (they told me to bring the car at 6:30 am but they didn't open until 7 am; they told me they'd have the rental there and then when I got there I had to wait for a ride to Enterprise, and Enterprise didn't open until 8 am; etc.)  BUT my real frustration came after I got my car back. The recall was just for the roof. . . but the same paint problem was clearly obvious on the top/sides of the car as well and they did not repaint these.  AND Turns out they had my car for 5 days but only paid for the car rental for 3 days. So Enterprise charged me for the other 2 days. I complained to St Louis Honda twice via email but got no response.

Then, this past weekend, was driving back from Chicago. The molding on my front windshield started flapping in the wind. Took the car to a glass place today to see if they would fix it. The guy asked if I'd recently replaced my windshield. (No.)  He then asked if I recently had body work done. (BINGO.) Turns out that instead of doing the work right, they just used a razor blade to cut the piece of vinyl out from around the windshield and then just glued it back on.  The glass guy said this is not going to last and I will continue to have problems unless they get in there and clean it out and replace the vinyl strip (OR replace the entire windshield).

I'm getting ready to complain to them again. But honestly, after this shoddy work, I don't really want them to do anything else to my car. 

So much for their claim about great service.",2014-08-22 20:45:15
QRHwtLwct-2XdiDcLHTdIw,HQG3no8C5U31z-k1MaYCqQ,eZnkhvhSfrWxNjpen8VqnA,3.0,7,3,3,"Not too long after a disappointing visit to An American Place, we approached Niche with pretty high expectations.

The three of us opted to order our own appetizers and entrees without taking advantage of the 3 course deal.  I started out with the roasted eggplant soup, which was nicely velvety reminiscent of the glop I scarfed down at many an Indian friends' place.  I really really wanted some bread to go with this (naan, anyone?) but alas, there was none to be had.  Even asking the waitress about it she politely mentioned that we could get the cheese plate... to get the bread o_O.  When I'm paying that much for a meal, I'd hope a small request for such a thing as a bit of bread would be easily taken cared of.

The pork cheeks, however, were a pleasant surprise.  Even though I think the foie gras used was from a can, the hong shao style braised pork cheeks with the pear gave a great flavor along with the chili pepper.  This was pretty well thought out.

The butter poached shrimp was a sort of conundrum, though.  What were we supposed to do?  Put the avocado stuff on the chip with the shrimp?  Shouldn't I have more chip and less avocado, then?  3 shrimp?  Proportions, damnit!  It was pretty darned tasty though.  

After the appetizers those high expectations were definitely being met.

We had the rotisserie chicken, the scallops, and the rib eye.  

The scallops were amazing.  They were ginormous.  The butter foam really worked.  The bitterness of the greens kinda worked with the sweet scallops but they were ok.

The guy who ordered the rib eye was severely disappointed.  
- ""When I get rib eye I expect fat, damnit!""
It was pretty dry, almost like a filet.

I honestly don't know why the fiance orders the roasted chicken all the time.  She doesn't like white meat and doesn't like it when her chicken is too dry.  Mind you, there's a fine line between ""good"" and ""too dry"" in her mind.  Sauce won't help out either.  I forget just how much that entree was, but I think it was in the high 20's.  There are plenty of other nice restaurants with far superior roasted chicken than the one that we had for much less.  However we were discussing this dish and we came the this conclusion:
- Chicken, 13 bucks.
- the rest?  the freaking watermelon foam.  Great.  It didn't even make it taste any better.  I was expecting it to have some crazy dynamic but it didn't.

We were considering getting dessert but the birthday girl was too annoyed with her chicken so we left.  

I thought the food was very good.  However, at this level, I'd expect far superior service and something to differentiate it from the many other bistro-esque places in St. Louis.  The ideas were interesting but the execution on the basic stuff (steak / chicken) needs some work.

So appetizers: 2 for 3.
Entrees: 1 for 3.

This place was ""pretty good"" and worth the visit, if only to appreciate the other places that St. Louis has to offer just a bit more.",2008-09-13 15:00:00

We love the food and now serving a limited menu but still offers most of the favorites. The tables are spaced according to the rules and 5 new tables have been added outdoors along Ford Street. So you have the option of seating in the all weather covered patio with large open windows, outdoors tables with umbrellas or inside. Tables are being sanitized and servers are wearing their masks. Upstairs has additional seating, a bar, mini bowling, arcade games, shuffle bowl and lots of T.V.'s with sporting events. You can also see Speedway Indoor Karting (SIK) go-cart cars on the track through the large windows. 1911 installed an elevator last year for those who cannot take the stairs. The entire restaurant is wheelchair accessible from parking, a large ramp, pressure plate entrance, seating, restrooms and access to the second floor. The restaurant is family friendly with the upstairs serving only adults after, I think, 10 p.m. Call ahead to confirm if this might be an issue for your group since things are changing now.

This afternoon my husband had one of his favorite, the Cajun Grilled Tenderloin, tender, flavorful with heavy cajun season and served with an option of one side (seasoned fries, tater tots or sweet potato fries). He opted for the delicious seasoned fries and allows me to steal a few to dip in my blue cheese dressing.

I ordered the thick Blue Cheese Burger topped with a generous amount of blue cheese crumbles, dill pickles, red onions and a slice of tomato. I ordered medium-rare which is cooked as ordered but very pink throughout just as a heads up. Ask your server which you should order if you are particular. I finished with the chocolate mousse pie with an Oreo crust. It was delicious, creamy and a nice balance of light and dark chocolate. It was a tough decision between the chocolate mousse pie, banana cream pie or a brownie topped with chocolate syrup. 

Whether you stop in for an appetizer and drink to watch the game or with a few friends for dinner and maybe bowling or axe throwing, you'll have a great time. SIK go-carting is attached to 1911 so start there, drive the go-carts for awhile and then go next door for dinner. Lots to do at Sarah Fishers and her husband, Andy O'Gara's restaurant and go-carting facility. FYI, additional parking behind the restaurant off Ford Street and checkout 1911 for your next event or catering needs. Event rooms are upstairs.",2020-08-02 20:15:40
K-g13d4sa881UaJnk2JYCg,tsZmG5DslXH-YSs37Nfikg,rXrDXe4CDifD44b1Z2_5BQ,3.0,5,0,1,"I feel really bad about giving this review given the current circumstances and since the new bakery just opened up but... 

I found Cake Slice (second store for Custom Cakes by Kitchen) this past Saturday on Facebook while looking for a raspberry filled cake for my friend's baby shower. The next day, Sunday, I picked up my daughter, her friend, and momma to be and we took a drive from the furthest part of Sparks out to Damonte Ranch. 

We arrived excited to see some yummy cakes but ended up being a little bummed out. There are no physical pictures or cakes to look at. So when picking out flavors you can't see any style of cake. Basically, the slices are pre-cut and placed into a sealed styrofoam box. The kids wanted to look at what they were choosing from. But that wasn't possible at all. All that was available were handwritten chalkboards with the name of the cake slices offered. A visual would have been really nice. In LA the bakeries leave the full cakes out, of course, covered and behind a display case, and they slice them as they are purchased (even with COVID). It allows you some eye candy while drooling over what you are wanting to purchase. Maybe they are still decorating since they just opened up on the 14th. However, some simple pictures at the register even would have been nice. 

We ended up with 9 slices: 
$8.50 per slice = almost $85 - $90 
The price wasn't listed anywhere so I gasped a bit. Sticker shock for sure. We don't even pay that much in LA for twice the size of a slice....but we aren't in LA. 

Our order included:
White with raspberry filling
Reese's Chocolate 
Oreo
Lemon filled with blueberries
Funfetti
White with chocolate chips
Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate
Carrot Cake
M&M 
Basically everything in the bakery.

We had 3 adult taste testers and 6 kid taste testers. 
Momma to be liked the Oreo and Reese's. She said those taste the best. Momma to be didn't care for the white raspberry at all. We expected a raspberry jam style filling but instead, it was a sugary frosting filled with raspberries (we think). She mentioned she could taste the sugar granules and mentioned the cake slices were way too sweet.

I thought the Oreo, Reese's, Lemon Blueberry, and the Carrot cake tasted like the description but I too feel that they were extremely sugary. I am a dessert person and love chocolate but I'm not sure how to explain the chocolate chip and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. They didn't taste like everyday chocolate. Maybe they used dark chocolate or maybe it's the brand they use? I'm not sure. You can really taste the peanut butter in the Reese's. The Lemon Blueberry was also good and tasted like it sounds but again, way to a sugary. I accidentally rubbed up against the boxes while taking the packages out of the bags and I literally had about 20 sugar granules on my shirt... just from pulling the cakes out of the bags. The cakes are dense, not so much fluffy and airy but I'm okay with that. 

Momma to be's hubby only liked the carrot cake and also mentioned they were way too sweet. 

The kids enjoyed the Oreo, funfetti, M&M's, and the Reese's. They made funny faces when tasting the others. 

Between the 9 of us, not one cake slice was completely finished. One of the girls (8 years old) actually only ate the cake part of her samples and no icing... That's not like her. So since we didn't finish the cake slices we stuffed them into my friend's fridge and that was that. Later that night the kids tried them again and so did momma to be. They all agreed the chocolate, chocolate, chocolate tasted okay and they finished that one. We split up the rest of the cake slices and honestly, most of them are still sitting in our fridges.  

The guy at the counter said they are opening up another store here in Sparks in January. Which we will then try it out. I would also like to see prices, pics, and/or actual cakes in the bakery at some point. I also hope they create a reward system because spending that much on a cake slice definitely deserves a reward after buying several slices.

I will move this review over to the Cake Slice bakery once their yelp is active since this isn't an actual review for the Custom Cakes by Kitchen location.",2020-08-25 05:49:54
op2_EOQMCAQh5R6RDWm8rQ,d3bee3DH0oYGMc7esLOq0g,Oc7XxUdoi1l4SCV-BLOSTw,1.0,10,2,0,"If I could give ZERO stars, I would for Gerhard's.  

Wife and I remodeled our kitchen, and we purchased a range, wall oven, dishwasher, and fridge from Gerhard's.  They have an excellent selection of products, including carrying Blue Star appliances which was the main draw for us.  Pricing wasn't horrible either, the showroom was pleasant, and the sales people mostly helpful.  I was also keen on the idea of a family owned and operated store, and it helped that the salesperson working with us was a Gerhard.  So we had no reservations moving forward with significant purchases.

The first of many issues came when it was time to take delivery of the items.  We got a call a couple weeks before informing us that all items were in and ready to be delivered.  So we worked with our contractor to schedule delivery and ensure his team was available to direct the appliances where they needed to go and begin installation.  While the delivery did come on time, only half of the items were on the truck!  To top it off, the wrong model dishwasher was delivered, and before anyone realized it, the appliance was installed and operational.  It was a pain in the ass fixing that mixup, and involved a 1.5 month long process involving at least two phone calls a week.  

Upon learning that only half of the items were delivered, a phone call to Gerhard's resulted in sorry, your sales person no longer works for the company (so much for being a family business!!!!) and ""we don't know what happened.  We'll call you back.""  This was the first of many no call backs.  Big strike against customer service there.  Ultimately, the impression given was that the items that weren't delivered weren't even ordered!  Gerhard's also cared less that my contractor and team were at a standstill on my dime, and that their time and my money was completely wasted due to their disorganization.  While I wouldn't have been thrilled with acknowledgment of a screwup before scheduling delivery, a bit of honesty on their end could have spared me wasted time and money.

Three weeks later, the same phone call comes: all of your items are ready for delivery.   All of them, I ask?  ""All of them.  We promise.""  Same routine: get crew on site day of delivery for quick turn around.  This time, however, Gerhard's delivery fails to show up!!!!!  It took multiple calls to their warehouse to figure out what was going on, but not a soul had any idea.  Yes: you are scheduled for delivery before 4PM today.  Oh, it's already 4PM?  Let me call the driver.  Sorry, the driver is busy, call I call you back?  You know the routine by now.  Ultimately, I gave up waiting, and told them to schedule delivery for the next day so I could send the crew home.  

Fortunately, Gerhard's delivery service did show up the next day as promised. 
Unfortunately, it was groundhog day: not all of the items were delivered, yet again!  Come on... really? Not much time was wasted on the contractor's end this time around as the big items were delivered, just not the dishwasher from the earlier fiasco, but still.  Another call to Gerhard's resulted in a ""we don't know what happened.""  Knowing it would be another multiple call effort to sort through the details, I ended up driving to the store and picking up the item myself.  

AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH, though I paid for the appliances up front in full (mistake on my part... all of my leverage was gone, and I couldn't simply say forget it: keep the appliances and I'm going elsewhere), I later received a bill telling me that a charge that was waived by the original sales person with the last name of Gerhard's who no longer works there was being added back to the bill.  WTF?  This item is still unresolved, and I'm not happy about it in the least.

Bottom line, Gerhard's is disorganized and does not have the skill set or training required to properly deal with customers and fix their own mistakes--of which there were many in my experience.  Go elsewhere.",2013-06-08 15:19:39
Hf5pz0rYFH0TwhpraTCVaw,SZ7BDiIA-FEJMgS8wbIofQ,vXb4OWsjPoiBtmarfexj-g,1.0,0,0,0,"I've been here several times in the last few years (about 5 times). All in all, the food is average for a brunch spot. 

I like their roof garden and green approach to things so I want to support their business.  If having a restaurant was just about the food - I would give this place a 3 star review perhaps.

However, I joined Yelp just so I could add to the comments on here about the subpar service I've experienced the last few times I dined here.

Mostly it has to do with the terrible system they have for communicating wait times and their approach to seating 3-4 groups vs 2 top table. I don't mind a wait because that is part of the factors to consider when brunching. I do mind the way the host gives you a wait time estimate that is off by 60 minutes. 

Even that I could look past in my pre-Yelp life. What really did me in was my last visit a few weeks ago...

I ordered ""eggs your way."" Pretty straight forward. I asked for my eggs ""over easy"" which is not a complicated endeavor.  I am not a good cook by any means but the one thing I can make is diner perfect eggs. Over easy. Which is a standard preparation. I'm not even asking you to poach it. 

I also asked for my bacon to be well done.

The waiter (wish I could remember his name) brought out a plate of very chewy bacon and eggs that had RUNNY white yolks. Some people could say that maybe  the difference between sunny side up and over is not that clear... 

But to me, I simply wanted classic over easy with cooked egg whites and runny yolks. 

I debated eating it but my dining companion said for $9 I should have the breakfast I want. The place was half empty late on a Sunday afternoon long past the brunch rush.

So I asked my waiter about getting new eggs cooked properly.

Here's why Green Eggs earns their one and only star:

My waiter proceeds to catch a serious attitude. Right from the start. As if its unreasonable for a customer to ask for something to be addressed.

Second, he proceeds to literally lecture me about what ""over easy"" eggs are and are not. He insisted that over easy eggs can ONLY be made by having runny egg whites. That there is NO WAY to keep the yoke runny without having the whites runny too.

I wanted to burst out laughing. It's bizarre when someone is confidently telling you what is impossible when I've eaten over easy eggs endlessly in my life. I can make them. It's not that hard.

I just couldn't believe the way he addressed me as a customer, tried to make me feel bad for asking for my original request to be honored, to lecture me on something that just isn't true and to act finally as if you're doing me some grand favor for asking the cooks for my miracle eggs.

I didn't even mention the bacon, because let me guess, bacon can never be crispy. It's impossible! 

I've never before asked for my over easy eggs to be sent back at any no name diner in this city or surrounding counties. It's just simply not that hard.

Green Eggs food is pretty meh in general for the prices and quality and wait... But their service is just so damn lame. 

Next time someone tries to get me to go Green Eggs, I'm definitely going to pass. Cafe Lift has better French toast and they apparently understand the mysterious art of cooking over easy eggs.",2013-07-28 19:54:24

That pair came back and I had the same problem with the same lens. They recommended I go back to my prescriber and make sure the script was written correctly. It was. They then checked the Pupillary Distance and determined that they were not centered properly. Again they needed to ship my glasses out to the lab to get re-cut. I never heard back from them after that and got busy with life waiting for them to let me know when my glasses came in. Well it's now December and I had not heard a single thing from them. Being as how in 2 months I am going to go back to the doctor to get my check up it is highly likely my script will change. I called up the store and asked for a refund since they failed to contact me that my glasses were ready. They refused and then said they would talk to the manager of the store the next day. Trevor the manager did not call me the next morning as was promised so I called him. He was supposedly out or with another person and was unable to take the call but he did call back in the afternoon. He reiterated that they can give me the glasses which will only be good for a few months or give me a credit towards another pair that I don't want (Let's be real their selection sucks and they dont help you find a decent pair when you're looking for a set of frames as it is). I declined and requested for a refund as I have already been jerked around by these people. I really don't want to drive 35-45 minutes not including the extra time for traffic to pick up these glasses that are probably not cut properly in the one lens as recent history dictates.  It's just not feasible and I don't have extra cash lying around for gas and tolls. not to mention dragging my very tired kid who just got off the bus from school for the ride. Trevor said he would contact the regional manager  and get back to me. Several hours later I get a call from Trevor and he restated that he could give me the glasses or give me a credit towards another pair. I declined and asked for a refund again and told him I'd have my lawyer contact them. He practically laughed at me and said ""OK"" as if the loss of my nearly $525 dollars is somehow humorous. I do in fact have a trusted attorney that I will be reaching out to in order to collect my money from them. I don't understand why this company would want to have an angry, upset, and pissed customer. I do not want to do business with a company that failed to make my glasses correctly in the first, second, and third place then blame it on my eye doctor, and then failed to get in contact with me for 9 months regarding their arrival in the shop. They claim I was notified by robocall. I don't pick up calls from numbers I don't recognize and no voicemail was left for me. They never spoke to me regarding the pick up of my glasses and they failed after 3 times to cut both of the lens properly. Do not do business with them they are thieves",2019-12-16 23:42:19
NgpABqlLJRBWvtP9V8QjEQ,g4T4X0IoUjRNFEJpgyWhSA,qhsJbgxVNDb0973r3Gjrow,2.0,1,1,0,"The good: I got the open face fried egg and pimento cheese sandwich.  It was really excellent, once I peeled off the layers of fairly tasteless but moist ham that all but drowned out the pimento cheese. I believe the menu indicated the pimento cheese is made in-house and it was a surprising and very nice compliment to the fried egg.
The so-so: Fries were okay, but nothing special.  The roasted beet salad was fine. But, again, I found that the beets floundered somewhat amongst too many other ingredients and flavors.  For my taste, a lighter hand with the dressing would have been appreciated, but it wasn't terribly overdressed and others might like it just fine.  One other thought I have about the menu is that not everything has to have bacon or some other pork product added to it.  I've noticed this lately with a couple of ""farm-to-table"" type restaurants.  And I find it a real disappointment. Missouri farms offer so much more than just pork.  What is this compunction about adding it to every darned thing?  I might have enjoyed the trout, if it didn't come wrapped up in bacon.  And exactly who is it who needs a giant pork chop accompanied with Italian sausage?
The bad: the dessert was an incredible disappointment. I had the peach and blueberry cobbler. It was advertised as coming with ice cream, and when I get ice cream with a cobbler, I expect to have enough for a bite of ice cream with just about every bite of cobbler. Instead, what I got was a small dollop of ice cream that was barely enough to accompany two bites of cobbler.  And this cobbler would have really benefited from the additional ice cream, because I was wishing for something to cover up the soggy oat topping.  I ended up deciding it wasn't worth the calories, so sent it back almost uneaten.  When I mentioned to the waitress that I wasn't pleased with the amount of ice cream, there was no appearance of a manager, no offer to remove it from my bill, not even an offer of a free cup of coffee.  So much for good service--which I think is best judged when things don't go perfectly. It meant the difference between me leaving there feeling like taking the time to write a fairly negative review, versus me leaving feeling like I'd had a decent--though not great--meal and coming home to do my laundry.
The conclusion: The fried egg was so good that I might go back and order it without the ham. Or maybe I'd save almost the entire cost and make it at home for myself sometime.",2019-07-22 03:42:14
eid2rHgcACwefUKBe_inSA,kO30XR2WeF6bla6dK1ZZLw,AT-b59vVPAHdLhNzZfUw7Q,4.0,15,3,16,"For part of my birthday gift, the GF got us tickets to a cooking demonstration and wine tasting at PA School of Wine. It's a cute setup, with several two-tops up front and a larger community table taking up the main expanse of the room. Chalkboards took the place of the walls, replete with the names of wines as well as the ingredients and directions for the dishes that would be created on this night. 

We had Chef Keith for our culinary class and he was busy prepping when we arrived 15 minutes early so we could grab a seat near the front. We appreciated the mirror above him, which allowed us to see his prep station. 

We started off the meal with some background on the Wine School and the meal we were about to enjoy. Walnut crisps and a pour of white wine kicked things off while Chef got started on the first dish. 

Our starter was a salad focused on carrots. While the carrots were beautiful and fresh, they were definitely too large and hard to cut with the salad knife we were provided. The vinaigrette was also a bit too acerbic, though I appreciated the use of walnut oil, which was a nice touch with the hazelnuts. I did enjoy the tips Chef offered. Salt, pepper, lemon - amazing what a few ingredients will do to amp up your boring salads at home! 

Our next dish was a mushroom farro, which had a great essence from the stock and was paired with another white wine. The salty hits of shaved parm on top were much needed to offer up some salt and richness to each bite. Pro-tip here? If you're cooking hearty grains, don't use just water. You should always have a few boxes or cans of chicken/beef stock on hand! 

Our final dish came in the form of nicely cooked filets with a Bordelaise red-wine sauce. Steaks were prepped in advance via sous vide, with a final sear with a blow torch! Roasted asparagus accompanied the steaks, along with a pour of red wine.  

As we left, there were a tray of chocolates for us to enjoy as a final bite. 

So if you're looking for a fun, culinary date night, I'd recommend checking out Wine School of Philadelphia. Tickets are typically around $75pp, so it's a discount if you're not ready to splurge on the level of an Audrey Claire Cook class.",2016-07-20 14:59:29
Z4zhbeftkeKeao2CVujuFQ,8MkZ6bpdP7x8Vlm_uEWDqw,tlmxMUrk9xRvYzH0xo1Olg,4.0,1,0,0,"To be very honest, my expectations were not high because I had a rough critic with me at a restaurant that was brand new (as far as we knew, anyway). 

That being said, first impression was great. The facade and door really gave me a confident and positive vibe. Unfortunately the parking lot felt small and the entrance to the lot was unkind to my car; making a left turn into the lot from speedway is an unforgiving angle for someone not in a truck/SUV. I was also unsure how to feel about the fact that this place has a drive thru, but hey, options in the time of COVID isn't a bad thing. 

So, on to the food: 
The starters were chicken karate and pork bao buns. Both were tasty in our opinion though I appreciated the chicken more. The buns were very nice BUT two buns for that price seemed overly steep. The drinks come in small mason jars which seems like a strange choice for a place that is otherwise so authentic. 

The mains were the #1 ramen (extra pork & egg) and pork fried rice. 
Ramen: My wife's favorite ramen is no longer in operation so we've been keeping an eye out for something comparable. So far nothing has measured up but this one came so close that it can be the go-to in a pinch. The broth is nice and rich, the noodles were good, the price (with add ons) was super fair and the portion was good. 
Rice: overdone. I tend to base my initial judgments on new places on simple things like noodles and rice. In a place that has fried rice and something separate called ""black fried rice,"" I would not have expected my regular pork fried rice to be so burnt tasting..and in fairness my server agreed with my assessment; I think he even mentioned the charred taste before I did... The portion was fine (could have been bigger) but the proteins are cubed which I prefer compared to larger cuts or slivers you might see at other places. The bowl comes with a small side of pickled radish which is a nice contrast but it would be nicer to have more. 

At the end of it all, I'm happy to come back and try some more stuff. If we only had some #1s and a side, we'd be more than happy but I'm also enticed to explore some more.",2021-04-03 03:26:09

My daughter and I had issues from the time we walked in until the time I gave her my credit card and walked out, thoroughly disgusted and very underwhelmed.

When we walked in we were ""greeted"" by a hostess, let's call her Brittini (yes, with an I, she gave off that impression) and were told that our wait would be about 15 minutes, but we were more than welcome to sit at the bar and wait for our table.  We agreed, and instead of sitting us at the bar, she crammed us into the corner at the end of the bar where they had a tall table with bar stools at it.  Ok, not my most comfortable of perches, but if I wanted to sit rather than swelter out in the afternoon heat, this was my only option.  When we arrived the dining room was practically empty, but those tables were reserved for other people - ALL of them.  Ok, no worries, let's get on with the show.  I tried to get comfortable at this table we were sat at, but it was literally crammed into the corner against the end of the bar and another wall that separated the bar from the main dining area.  Our server was great, I don't remember his name unfortunately, however, he was bartending as well.

He served us warm water from the bottle he was carrying and said he would be right back.  He did come right back and offered us bread, which we accepted and the bread basket was a nice touch, while they serve real butter, be forewarned it is UNSALTED.  The bread itself was nothing to write home about, just normal fare French rolls, but tucked in there were tiny little nuggets of perfection in the form of jalapeno corn bread muffins, those were delicious :).

My daughter and I opted to split an entrée and order an appetizer to share.  We settled on the fried green tomatoes with crab and remolaude sauce.  My daughter described the sauce as more like tartar sauce with a little kick.  I'll defer to her on that one, I thought it was vile.  I was SHOCKED too, when we received three slices of tomatoes and about an ounce of crab meat (I say that because we ordered it on the side and it showed up in the same cup size the sauce was in) and that was $15.00...excuse me?  $15.00 for three slices of tomatoes?!  Brittini came to check on us and all was well at this time.  As another reviewer said, they want your appetizer and entrée order at the same time, but I disagree it is so they can fire both courses at the same time.  We got our appetizer in a pretty short amount of time after being seated, but our entrée, that was an entirely different animal.  

We ordered the baked chicken to split - description - 1/2 a chicken, baked mac and cheese, sautéed spinach...ok, pretty decent.  I am not a fan of spinach and asked if we could sub the grits instead, but it was explained to me they could remove the spinach and charge me for the grits as a side - in other words, no substitutions.  We waited 50 minutes from the time we finished our appetizer until we received our dinner and when we did, the chicken was over cooked and stone cold.  The baked mac and cheese, I had to ask the waiter where the cheese was and he explained it was a ""bleu cheese sauce"", not really cheese and it was topped with an amazing amount of toasted, unseasoned bread crumbs that did NOTHING to enhance the flavor of the over cooked pasta.  I ate one tube of the pasta and I was done.  I hate bleu cheese and who the hell makes mac and cheese with bleu cheese?!  My daughter was hungry and ate that and the spinach, which she described as bitter and devoid of any flavor and since they had topped it with the same offensive bread crumb as the mac and cheese, was pretty terrible.  We both complained to each other about the chicken and sort of picked at it here and there hoping for a redeeming bite, however that proved fruitless, in the end we left it on the plate.  I should say the real star of the food on our table were the grits, they were absolutely OUTSTANDING.

Brittini came over to check on us about 20 minutes after our food arrived and my daughter complained about the chicken.  We were not given the opportunity to have them re-cook it, or she did not ask us if we wanted anything else, she just scooped the plate up and said she would remove it from the bill.  Fine, whatever, at this point I was completely done with this restaurant.  I gave my credit card to my kiddo and weeded through the droves of people who had somehow materialized while we were eating and crowing me even further into the corner and escaped into the balmy evening.  Needless to say, poor service on behalf of the hostess and poor quality of food does not rate a return visit - E V E R !!!",2015-08-29 09:07:28
ie-f4QdVV9JAxvqmElcTeQ,us7Es6_r7dIe3ywboL85FQ,6_OAIFxSk3YjNdRJv59Saw,1.0,1,0,0,"Where to begin...I made a reservation for 18 people for 9:00pm. I was told from the beginning that we would receive two tables which was fine. We were not seated until after 9:40. The manager told us we would receive a round of drinks on them for us being so patient. After being seated the waitress made an announcement to both of our tables about how the dining experience is for everyone to tell her what you want and she will decide how many to order because everything was shareable. She also said some cocktails were coming because we waited so long to be seated. She began taking drink orders. Things were going pretty smooth aside from the very large table behind us constantly getting up and knocking a few of our purses off of our chairs (at least three times). Oh and one of the ladies had on a VERY strong perfume that was giving myself and a friend a headache (not the restaurants fault but just added fuel to the fire by the end of our dining). So after we all order (both tables) they began bringing out food not too long after. We noticed that the other table with our party was getting more food at a time. We waited a little too long for more of the food to come out. Jump ahead the other table finished 45 minutes before us. We were there for a birthday and because they finished they went ahead and left. After we received majority of our food we asked the waitress where two of our pizzas were. She came over and showed her ticket and said she forgot to put them in (literally the only things not scratched off her list) and asked if we still wanted them. It was now 11:00pm. Yes we wanted them. They rushed the order because the pizza was mostly red sauce with like three pieces of mozzarella on it. Disgusting! While waiting for the pizza some people ordered dessert and we told the waitress we were there for a birthday. They brought the cake out and started singing while i was eating the pizza. I was so annoyed. Jump ahead to 11:40, we received our check. I immediately see the first round of cocktails on the bill. I tell the waitress. She says she doesn't remember what we got so they took 15% off. That would've been fine had we not had 10 people with each drink being a minimum of $10 a piece. The totals didn't equal out. We paid and tipped about 15% which is not like me but our service was terrible. I went to the restroom and while waiting I hear our waitress complaining to the manager that it wasn't her fault and that we should've tipped more. To recap the BS...we were seated 40min late with a reservation, we were told TWICE that the first round of drinks was on them, one table was finished before the other, the waitress forgot our food, we were rushed at the end because they close at 12 (hence the nasty pizza and putting chairs up while we were still in there), and now I have to listen to someone complain because of her mess ups. Lastly, the manager and the owner never once came to our table to say anything! They were busy with the table of about 16 behind us who sat right after us, got their food before us, and were finished over an hour before us. Time frame at this restaurant 9:00-11:50. It gets one star but deserves a zero. I am so sad that our experience here was so terrible.",2019-08-23 10:59:42
InwsCbYFxjLaugltfFsiIA,Im7i_GkxrCelWbyiDVLvRw,y-wKtNfvoZgEZB36xto5fA,1.0,5,0,0,"Food was okay but over priced. And I always question a place where the menu is so scattered: you can't specialize in seafood, bbq, tacos, and pizza equally. 

Then the service was awful. We had six people for dinner and another two who joined for drinks. Nobody was given silverware and we had to ask for basics like napkins for us and drinks for our joiners. 

After three points of service (1- drinks, 2- food served/drinks for two people who joined, 3- can we have some napkins please?) we were left alone for an hour. Then we flagged down our server to ask for another round of  drinks. 

By the time the second round of drinks was delivered, we were ready for our check, but our server disappeared after bringing the last round. We finished our drinks for another half an hour and decided to go back into the bar to get our bill. 

Bar staff were none too worried about getting the bill to us. ""She's on her way,"" they said, and we waited another 20 minutes. We looked around for another 15. And finally we said, ""Eff it, I bet if we walk out, we'll finally get the tab."" We were in the car when...lo and behold: our server, another woman, and an extra from the Sopranos appeared! (Thanks for coming, you guys! Wish you'd have been around when we needed silverware!)

The team detained us in the parking lot, making it look like we were hoodlums who tried to walk out on our tab (which admittedly was the point we wanted to make to the staff, because we had asked to pay like an hour before). 

They said that our server had been busy splitting our check, which nobody asked her to do. They gave us the separate bills and STILL charged some of us wrong amounts. My fiancé is currently fuming that he was not only over-charged, but that they put the charge through twice.  As a consolation, we are invited to come in tomorrow morning (Saturday, 9 am) to sort it out. What a FUN way to end a Friday night and start the weekend!

In short, I would adamantly not recommend this place. At first, I just thought it was just a little trashy, but I now consider it at best: disorganized and unconcerned with visitor experience; at worst: pretty shady and generally an awful experience.

This is our always go to place when comes to brunch. Order anything on their menu you will never be disappointed. Everything is good and made to order! 

Today August 30, 2019 my wife and I couldn't be more excited to come here and have the Pork Chops and eggs over rice with spam on the side and Loco Moco! These are always as good as you expect it. Unfortunately, today they're having an issue with their rice cooker. The waiter claims that he couldn't open the lid due to pressure of the steam inside and it's not allowing it to open it until it cools down a bit. So we said that it's fine we have enough time to wait till the rice cooker allows them to open it. After 15 minutes or so I noticed the server had a clear plastic container with water and uncooked rice in it. I noticed that he put the container inside the microwave and cooked the damn rice in the microwave! OMG

First of all, if you have a restaurant or if you're a chef YOU NEVER USE A DAMN MICROWAVE OR HAVE A MICROWAVE in your kitchen! That's a NO NO! Any professional chefs will tell you the same thing not to microwave any food in your kitchen if you're serving fresh food or have a damn microwave! It ruins the quality of food and ruins your restaurant's reputation. 

Second, now that the rice is cooked and served, our rice is now a cancerous and no longer as good as it was cooked in rice cooker. Let me remind you our rice was cooked in the ""plastic"" container. I don't care if it's microwaveable or if it's safe IT IS STILL PLASTIC! 

What bothers me the most is if they knew what the problem with the rice cooker they could have prevented this from happening or they could have told us that the rice rice wouldn't be available until the next hour or so... then we would have gotten something else rather than tell us it'll be ready in a few minutes or rather than cooking it in a plastic container then microwave it. 

Our whole trip was really disappointing and wish we didn't have to witnessed how they cooked the rice from the microwave. 

For those who are first timers, please make sure to ask your server not to serve you microwave food. Thank you for your attention.",2019-08-30 22:21:13

I also get to Dose pretty regularly because it's near my son's daycare and my work. I should be more than satisfied with my coffee shop selection, but none of them have quite hit my sweet spot. Here's my list of coffee shop ideals:

1) Locally roasted coffee (sorry Dose and Barista Parlor)
2) Not Drew's Brews (just don't love it - sorry Sip and Ugly Mugs)
3) Option to get individual cuppings in a French Press, Pourover, Chemex, Aeropress, Clever dripper, or something. (Sorry Bongo Java and Portland Brew)
4) Soothing, homey atmosphere that isn't snotty (sorry Barista Parlor and Portland Brew)
5) Reasonable (not cheap - I know good coffee is expensive) prices
6) Decaf options for my second or third cup (sorry Barista Parlor and Dose - decaf espress just won't do for me)

Things I (personally) don't really care about or know anything about:
1) Coolness (in fact, too much cool is a turnoff)
2) Espresso drinks - I drink black brewed coffee
3) Food choices - I'm there for coffee
4) Really anything but the coffee and the comfort

All this to say, The Well is my favorite coffee shop in Nashville, which is extremely surprising given its Green Hills location. A huge selection of coffee from Just Love means there's plenty of variety in single origin or blends, whatever your roast preference (as a City roast fan, I think I have 10+ coffees to choose from!). They will make it with a pour over cone, a Chemex, an Aeropress, or a French Press - a wealth of options. I've had the pour over and the Aeropress, and both were executed quite well, creating clean and flavorful cups. 

The tables are large, the wood everywhere inside leads to a comfortable feeling, and there are couches and squishy chairs if you want comfort over utility. The wifi is reasonably fast (I'm posting this review on it!) 

And prices are reasonable - $2 for 12 oz cups made to order, with refills coming in at just a dollar! That wouldn't be cheap for coffee brewed in a giant pot, but for single-cup brewing it's an amazing deal.

Yes, the Baristas are a little slow and unprofessional-seeming, but they know how to make good coffee. Yes, the bathrooms are kind of gross. Yes, the building needs work - there are some leaks in the hallway leading to the bathroom on this rainy day. No, they don't have good food choices. But I, personally, don't care. They hit everything on MY list, which makes them my favorite. I will certainly give them patronage whenever I have the opportunity, and will be much more reluctant to go to my local East Nashville shops knowing this exists.",2013-01-30 15:03:53

We took the Northern Lights Tour to Iceland and it was amazing. We flew direct to Iceland from Boston (about 4.5 hours) on Monday night and landed early Tuesday morning. Our guide, Snorri, met us right at the airport holding a sign and wearing a green green hat. After the rest of the tour takers arrived, we were loaded onto our bus where we met our bus driver, Jonas. we rode for about 40 minutes into Reykjavik where we left our luggage at the Centerhotels Arnarhvoll and grabbed some breakfast.

Since we couldn't check-in to the hotel until 1p, Snorri and Jonas took us on a tour of the city of Reykjavik. We saw some interesting city sights and Snorri kept us all entertained with local tips/info. After the tour, we checked in to our room and got some lunch upstairs in the SKY Restaurant & Bar (fantastic view). We had a couple of hours off to rest up before we met for a welcome reception at 5:30p. Then we grabbed a snack and met up with another tour guide and driver for the actual Northern Light Tour (I didn't catch their names but they were awesome, too). We caused around outside of the city from 8p - 2a looking for the Lights and finally found them - they were glorious!!

Not going to lie - with the time change, that first day was tough. 

On the second day (Wednesday), we attended an optional excursion to the Laugarvatn Fontana Geothermal Baths. It was so cool to sit in a steaming hot pool next to a windswept lake while surrounded by snow-covered mountains! We grabbed lunch at the Baths then headed back to the hotel. This trip was about 6 hours long and was definitely worth the cost. We had dinner that night at the Icelander Restaurant - right up the street from the hotel - where  whale and puffin are on the menu in addition to plenty of fish. Then we checked out some local bars and eventually bunked down at The Lebrowski Bar (which was awesome).

On the third day (Thursday), we took the day-long Golden Circle bus tour. This was a great tour that took us to places we didn't even know about and probably wouldn't have found on our own. We went to the Orka náttúrunnar - ON power station, the Kerið crater lake, the Gullfloss (Golden) Waterfall, the geysir, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (where the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates meet). It was a fantastic tour!! That night, we went across the street to The Harpa and had dinner in the Kolabrautin Ristorante. 

On our final day (Friday), we had the morning off to shop around town and then Snorri and Jonas picked us up for the transfer back to the airport. 

This trip was such a good deal - it included airfare (no additional luggage fees), hotel, breakfast for days 2-4, the city tour on the first day, and the transfers to and from the airport. Snorri was an excellent guide - very nice and funny and full of good info/tips - and Jonas was a hell of a driver - those icy roads are no joke!! We really appreciated how well they took care of us and would be happy to travel with them again.

Tip for traveling to Iceland in January: It's cold but it was warmer there than it was in Boston during our visit. Back stuff you can layer and don't forget your hat, scarf and gloves. Also, it was much winder there that we expected - it can take you off of your feet!

Iceland is a beautiful country. If you have the chance to visit with Gate 1 Travel, definitely take it!",2016-01-10 13:33:35

No, my philosophy is the glass is totally full, and it's not that way because someone filled it for me, it's that way because I've learned how to keep it full.  This being said, I just wish that certain members of the younger generation, high school and college aged individuals understood that the only way to even have a glass at the table, regardless of the condition of the contents, is to embrace the overwhelming need to have a true sense of urgency in attaining short term goals.  Politeness will only get you so far.  So in other words, hustle it up.

Outback is just about always a 4 star, sometimes a five, in my book.   The food is always consistent providing an experience that is as predictable as the fact that the sun will most certainly rises in the east every morning.  This location, with my server is a 3.5, however just about every other staff member is a five, for service, which brings the total up just above a four.   We had to ask a bus boy for our first drink after no less than 10 minutes.  (I time such things.  It should be no more than about two minutes, especially on a slow Monday night.) Normally I would be going bonkers, but I was taking my mother out and she is disabled and often drinks rather quickly at restaurants for some reason.  Better to slow her down than to have a difficult time getting her situated in the car.  So the delay was good, but it was not intentional, it was just a slow and inattentive on the part of the server. 
 
The waitress was overly pleasant when she came by, which was at the edge of annoying, the very edge.  So drinks were very slow, food was very slow, and I noticed the manager running around getting surveys from surrounding customers.  My facial expressions may have kept her away, but I really try not to project my emotions, especially of annoyance, on my face when people are touching my food. 

It is what it is.  Most every other server was hustling.  Our server seemed like she was better suited for the career choice of skipping through a field counting the butterflies and singing with the blue birds.  Being nice and pleasant is good; however being efficient and conscious of your guests is often times more important.

Outback could have had another drink out of each of us and maybe desert, which might have added another 20 bucks to the check.  This in turn would have added another 2 dollars to the waitress's tip.  Servers are, for all intents and purposes, commissioned sales people.  It is a nickel and dime business, and no nickels or dimes can be left on the table.

Maybe this server would be best utilized as a hostess.  For all I know she was a hostess the day before.  At any rate, the GM of this location should ensure that the server training is universally administered and a time table as to an acceptable wait time for customer interaction should be reviewed.
Again, if not for the hustle of everyone else in the restaurant, this review would be regrettably much lower.",2014-11-24 14:50:34

in August I took my 2008 335i to this dealership because the car kept shutting down.  Turns out if you have problems with your cooling system (water pump, coolant, thermostat, hoses, etc) the computer will send a shut out signal to the engine so it never over heats. Well, after an hour of the car being there, I sure as hell received a call that my car needed a new water pump and a new hose. That they checked the system and that is why it was turning off. I said okay, how much for the water pump and other items. They said $1300 approximately. I told them go ahead and do it and that the car had full warranty. So a couple hours later I received a call from Jennifer (service advisor) saying all will be covered by the warranty except for one hose ($300 lol) I said okay! Please get the car fixed. 

Here is the catch! My car had the ""service engine light"" come on three days ago so like a normal person I took it back to the MAIN LINE BMW where once again I was directed to a service ""scammer"" advisor this time named Michael.  He said, we will call you  with a diagnosis all with a very poor attitude. 

The call two hours went like this:

Hello sir this is Michael from bmw your car has a couple issues 1. Needs a new water pump and also needs a thermostat. 
2. Will also needs brakes soon

My response, perfect please fix it since its under warranty. You guys just changed the water pump in the last service!!!

Michael- sorry sir I did not look at the records in your car, you are right the water pump is fine. You need a new thermostat. That will a little over $400. 

----what? For a thermostat? $400 shouldn't you guys had changed it when the water pump and hoses where changed you were fixing the cooling systems?

His response, No sir. We only checked the water pump and hoses that time. The code from your computer says it's the thermostat and based on the age of the car it probably has never been changed

---okay go ahead and fix it. I need my car

5 minutes later I get a call from Michael again!!!

Sir, I made a mistake it's not $400 for the thermostat. I didn't include labor and the diagnosis cost. You are looking at $700 total and your car will be ready in the morning

----what for a thermostat? $700? This is absurd 

Michael- Sir that is the price. We will see you tomorrow 

okay!!! So I called other bmw dealerships and mechanics after this call. Turns out when they do an diagnostic on a car and involves the water pump and hoses they will check everything about the cooling system including radiators and stupid thermostat. Obviously BMW MAIN LINE doesn't understand what this means and they will get you for a water pump every time if you don't open your mouth and also for a thermostat ($80 to $180 max depending on year and model of your car)


$700 for something they were supposed to do and check before all with a horrible attitude and pretty much leaving you without options!

This just happened yesterday Nov. 13th, 2014. I am sure they can look at my name and at least offer me an apology for their poor customer service and for the SCAM they have going on. I am selling this car and staying away from BMW because of this  dealership being the only one close to me!!!",2014-11-14 11:09:53

We shared the turtle soup, fried green tomatoes appetizer, New York Strip and Veal Alyssa.  Manfriend thought the turtle soup was good, about on par with Mr. Ed's (his favorite).  The fried green tomatoes were presented beautifully and the delicious batter, remoulade and lump crabmeat made up for what I thought was too thick of a cut on the tomatoes.  Manfriend about flipped over his perfectly cooked steak (between medium rare and medium and still sizzling on the hot plate, of course).  The seasoning and herbed butter on the steak was perfect.  The best dish, in my opinion, was my Veal Alyssa.  When it was served I was honestly groaning inside because the veal was sitting in what looked to be way too large an amount of lemon butter sauce, but oh, was I wrong.  The sauce was light and flavorful and in the perfect amount for the 3 large pieces of paneed veal.  The veal was perfectly crisped, tender and well seasoned.  The linguine with bolognese that is served alongside the veal was delicious as well, but I didn't even eat it in favor of devouring the veal (mmm, leftover linguine).  The side of garlic mashed potatoes we ordered with manfriend's steak was pretty good, but not spectacular--we definitely should have ordered the onion strings or one of the au gratin dishes instead.

We elected not to get dessert because we were so full, but if the rest of the meal was any indicator, I bet it is delicious.  A few people have complained about the price point, but I honestly thought it was fair for such a good restaurant.  We ordered one glass of wine, soup, an appetizer, two entrees and one side and totaled out at about 110 dollars before we used the Living Social deal (130ish with tip).  Two drinks and two entrees at another nice restaurant would run you about 80 dollars (95+ wtih tip),  so that really doesn't seem any more overpriced than every other high dollar restaurant in New Orleans to me.  With the Living Social deal we got a downright steal--where we probably couldn't afford it otherwise--so I certainly can't complain.

Service was courteous, quick and flawless.  We felt a little like spectacles when they asked if it was our first time there (the people next to us actually turned and looked)--maybe that is due to the ""regulars"" other reviews talked about? Well guess what, next time won't be our first time ""regulars,"" so there!

Mr. John's is definitely now on my 100% sure thing list for a great New Orleans dinner.",2012-07-30 06:13:48

""where do you want to go for dinner?"" 
""I don't know...""
We decided we would try Dan Dan. I had recently been introduced to Dan Dan noodles (why has it taken so long for me to stumble across these noodles sent from heaven??) and as spicy food hound I am, I jumped at the chance for a little spice. 

Naturally, by the time we decided on where we were going to eat it was later in the evening. It was a Friday night and we arrived to Dan Dan probably around 8:45? The place was still pretty crowded with lots of people picking up food and moving about. 

This is why it is 4 stars instead of 5. When we arrived the hostess wouldn't make eye contact with us for at least 5 minutes of us waiting there. It was odd. Instead of asking if we could wait a minute she just ignored us as she handled other costumers. She was really friendly once she wrapped up with the other patrons, but it was a weird 5 minutes. Also, the waiting space is tiiiiny. You are basically pushed up against a wall because people still have to get by and there are bar stools in the aisle. I'm docking the star for basically this reason alone. Maybe I'm just awkward and I felt awkward waiting in that space when I was very obviously in the way...?

Other than that the experience was GREAT! We were seated upstairs which was cozy and intimate. Our server was extremely nice and helpful. She even told us tricks about reheating noodles and leftovers (ya right.. like we had leftovers.. HA!). She was very attentive though and refilled our rice and drinks without skipping a beat.

We started with the Dan Dan noodles (of course!) and they were perfect. They mix them up fresh at the table. As they mix you can smell the wafting spice and peanuts. I would say that bowl could probably be split with one or two other people. It is a pretty decent size portion! I also don't think it is too spicy but has just enough kick to taste it. However, I have an impervious pallet for spice so I might be a bad judge? 

For my main meal I tried the Sichuan Farmer's Dry Pot Lamb. HOLY MOLY. Friends-- this is delicious! It is spicy and lamb-y all at once and it is the perfect combination. I think Dan Dan really nailed the flavor combination here. I could not stop eating it even well after I was full. It was a really fantastic dry pot. I would order again.. and again..",2016-04-13 14:17:43

Many thanks to the previous posts. After finding a parking spot, less than a block away, we walked up to Bailey's Range. 

The space was full of unique style and interesting seating arrangements. If you have a large party they have the table arrangements for you. On Friday night at 7:30 PM Bailey's was definitely busy, but we were seated immediately. We had a nice table for two, but we would have loved to have had a table/window seat. This didn't ruin the experience, but instead only left us hoping for a different table during our next visit. Railing through out the balcony even had a festive string of garland and Christmas lights. 

Kate, our server was quick, attentive, and polite. With this being our first time, we were both up for suggestions and she did not disappoint. 

For drinks, I was out hoping to find a Gluten Free Beer. This was not Kate's fault, but my famous quest for a familiar flavor that I miss failed again. I can now scratch S'Peters Sorghum Beer off my list. My wife did enjoy her choice of Limoncello off the drinks menu section entitled ""Boozy Lemonade."" The water was served out of a bottle into our lidless drinking jars to add just enough of a different feel.

For dinner I took Kate's suggestion of the Bison Burger, with my additions bacon and a gluten free bun.  The toppings of lettuce and tomato were crisp and fresh. The sweet spicy pickle spear was perfect flavor add in. My wife relayed her positive review of her Buffalo Chicken sandwich. We both agreed the made in house catsup was amazing. Kate stated it is hit and miss as some do not enjoy the catsup, but we both loved it.

What are burgers without an additional side? We ordered a large order of fries to share and two dipping sauces were provided. I would have had more feedback had the house cheddar sauce been gluten free, but instead I can only rave about the ""rooster"" sauce that I had. A mayo based sauce, and plenty of other flavors. I'll have to remember to ask what was all in it the next time I am there even though Kate told me twice what was in it. The sauces were also made in house. There are still many more to try, but  Kate's recommendation were both enjoyed. 

To finish the experience we both decided to have one scoop of the salted carmel made in house ice cream. My wife decided to add additional carmel sauce.

The overall experience was driven by the service and perfect recommendations. We now have another establishment to recommend when friends and family ask for a ""fun meal.""",2012-12-01 04:45:42
Nn5gZUiamh3MYn0KNDY_Ag,OjxGgvJ2CV_aJqs7WanuFw,dYwki1-fsSRSyGvK4Uxu0Q,2.0,0,0,0,"I have not been to a Boston Pizza in over five years, since they were a regular destination on hockey road-trips. So, when my cousin suggested Boston Pizza as a location for our miniature family reunion, I was cautiously optimistic, hoping that a chain I always remembered as being extremely average had modernized their menu or improved in some way in the half decade since I last visited. Unfortunately, the opposite was true. 

The service was poor and sloppy, from the hostess giving our group the impression that we were intruding on her by entering the restaurant, to the waiter who was inconsistent, to the shattered plate my 81-year old grandmother had to step over on the way out of the restaurant. Sadly, the service was actually the best part of the experience. 

There is no way around it. The food was extremely poor. My spicy penne was served covering an extremely thick bed of shallots, which tasted like they were coated in barbecue sauce, amounting to a disgusting combination of flavors. The sausage was thin, and of poor quality. The sauce and pasta were equally bland and uninteresting. The nachos and yam fries were equally greasy and poor, and we were not even brought condiments such as ketchup with the fries. 

With all this being said, I was still willing to overlook this. After all, this is a Boston Pizza, and you don't go there expecting good food or competent service. You go there expecting a cheap, quick, and edible meal. Even this was not the case.

When I alluded to the fact that Boston Pizza hasn't changed their menu in a decade, I wasn't being entirely truthful. They have updated only one part of their menu: the prices. The average entree, even for a vegetarian pasta dish, ran between $15-19 before tax and top, and items such as fish or steak dishes were in the low to mid $20's. Perhaps most astonishing of all was the $19.99+3.00 (to add guac) plate of nachos, which was actually on the small side, had almost no meat, and was extremely underwhelming in taste and appearance. I have not infrequently ordered nachos for the regular price of a plate of nachos ($11-15) at other places that has been double the size and quality of these. Our bill for 6 diners, without drinks, came to an exorbitant $166.60. This meal wasn't worth half that.

Overall, this was a terrible experience. Boston Pizza as a company is clearly bleeding, on the way out and attempting to milk whatever suckers wander through their doors for every penny, without offering a quality product in return. Avoid this place like the plague, and let this company that is unwilling to adapt or treat its customers fairly go the way of the dinosaur. Do yourself a favor and open a can of Chef Boyardee. You'll be experiencing roughly the same result.

Sparknotes:
-Heavily overpriced (~200%)
-Microwaved Pasta sauce ready in 2 minutes. Tastes like it was manufactured in a lab.
-Horrible service
-Cramped seating atmosphere
-**Avoid this place!

I am not a Lawrence native, but business brings me to that side of town frequently, so of course I am more than enthusiastic for a work break that includes a nice adult beverage (or four).  

Located in a strip mall on the corner of 56th and Post, this place has promise.  It is a large bar with a nice layout, and should be successful -  but we'll get to that later.  I have visited this bar a handful of times over the past year, and been sorely disappointed in the food, in both cost and quality.  The burgers are obviously frozen, yet still will set you back $10- not much money I'll admit, but with all the other superior options around, you can see why this place is struggling.  They nickel and dime you over condiments as well; as in one visit where my server did not ask me what sauces I wanted with an appetizer combo, then when the food was brought out explained to me that  ""its too late, I'll have to charge you for them now"".  Not angry at the server, she was sweet and attentive, and obviously just following policies set forth by owners.  On a positive note, a bar guest next to me ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad, and while more expensive than most comparable bar prices, looked delicious!

The other issue with this place is that they can not keep a consistant staff to save their life (or to save their business would be a comment more on the nose).  They appear to have a new bartender bi-weekly, which was confusing until I sat through an ordeal that greatly illuminated the problem with Peppers "" Brew Garden"".  The owner's son.  

I was sitting at the bar, enjoying a (not current, but I like beer) Sam Adams Seasonal, when this guy bursts in through the back door of the kitchen and proceeds to scream at the bartender, server, and kitchen guy (mid-afternoon, there were only three staff members there, so it was especially obvious and awkward).  A table behind me in their ""family dining"" section hurriedly asked for their check at this awkward display, and I just sat there in awe.  

Screaming at your employees is a bad business move in general (spoken from true experience on both sides of the Executive Suite), but screaming at them in front of your clientele is business suicide.  This clown evidently has no care for basic etiquette let alone good business practices-- (and if an attorney heard the derogatory things that I heard him say to female employees in that one rant, that owners son would have a new gig panhandling on an exit off 465).

However, the bartenders, a new one each week notwithstanding, have been fun, the servers helpful, and, um, they have TVs?  Trying to end on a positive note, and that's all I got folks!",2014-08-24 14:01:41
fBnWTa9XFWMHA4dPwf4Bgg,ceiGKFbZJRv8S0QWzH2Fnw,AFYI0sfZ6WdVELjjEYOIpw,5.0,1,0,1,"We visited Busch Gardens today as a group. I brought my dad, my sister, my husband, and 3 friends. This is going to be a rather long review, but I hope to cover all the areas of our visit. 

I am a huge fan of the passport pass with Busch Gardens. Upon arriving, only I had a pass with admission for the day. My husband purchased a passport pass (for Busch Gardens & Adventure Island), we purchased one for my sister (with her upcoming birthday), and one of our friends purchased one too. My father and other friend purchased a funcard. During this month if you buy a Busch Gardens funcard, you get Adventure Island too. The perks of having a passport over a funcard? You receive parking for free, as well as other perks year round. You receive free $10 giftcards every few months, a ticket for a friend during the month of your birthday (how my third friend came), extra discounts on tours, BOGO deals, all sorts of specials (they change each month). No other park I've held a pass at gives special rewards like these each month. They are nice little surprises that make you feel appreciated.

The tram was busy, so we decided to walk. It was truly a short enjoyable walk for us, not more than 1/4 mile. Once we arrive to the front we got in line to purchase our tickets. There are plenty of kiosks available, if you can do self-service you can use these. You can also purchase dining bands and quick que passes there. We got in line with all the passes we had to buy. We waited about 15 minutes and were ready to go into the park. Security check was simple and fast. It you bring food, skip using tupperware... You can't bring that in, we heard someone else.

We purchased Dine All Day dining bands for 2 of us. We personally felt it was worth it, for the water bottles and snacks. They have changed their dining bands recently, so be ready for changes. Now you can get 1 entree an hour, and they scan. You can get unlimited drinks (including bottled water), salads, fruits, and desserts. They also now need to ring your items up, and scan your band. Annual passholders receive discounts on these, so they are very affordable. If you plan to eat twice, they are worth it. Now with your band you get BOGO on things like dip n dots, churros, popcorn, beer (yes BEER), and other various snack cart items.

You name it we ate it! We ate at Dragons Grill, for lunch. My favorite is the warm cherry/apple tart they make, but I couldn't find it today. We had dinner at the smokehouse, and that was delicious! The lines were a little backed up. But I really think it is people learning the new band system, and spring break crowds.

We took our time, and spilt up since we had so many people. Yet we felt very accomplished with our visit today. We visited several shows (Opening Night Critters, Motor City Groove, Treasures of the Mirage, and Iceploration). All were great, my favorite is the baby elephant in Iceploration. We also rode several rides (Kumba, Cheetah Hunt, Monteu, Falcon's Furry, and the train). I am not a huge fan of their new locker system. They ran out of lockers at Kumba, and it was a long wait for a locker... We ended out having my husband hold the bags so we could ride. Busch Gardens will not let you ride with bags for safety purposes.

My Husband and I did the Elephant's Insider tour upon first arriving. This tour with Noel was a truly awesome experience! It was very organic and real, which we really appreciate. Not a song and dance, and misrepresentation of what daily tasks are. We felt involved and educated on what they were doing right in that moment, as if none of it was ""planned."" Knowing how such beautiful and large creatures are cared for while being able to learn neat things hands on is great. I encourage this tour for all who love elephants. It was an additional cost after admission, I thought it was a very reasonably priced tour ($26 per person w/ annual passholder discount).

We visited the kangaroos, and fed them for $6. I wish we got more lettuce than other things like pellets and hay, because they are only interested in the lettuce. I appreciate this exhibit, it lets you interact and pet them up close.

Overall Busch Gardens is a great experience. They really do deliver a great day at the theme park.",2016-03-25 02:20:18

This is okay as long as we receive such outstanding service as we did for our Christmas Eve dinner. Our waiter handled 2 large parties that were in front of us - along with our wee table for 2 (we were seated at the back of the room) with grace, humor, and  right on the spot service. He might have had more tables under his outstanding care, but all I noticed was the delicious food and excellent service that made for a wonderful, memorable holiday meal. I asked if he was working the following evening, since we had reservations for Christmas dinner. My intent was to request seating in his service area for a repeat performance. Alas, he was off duty on Christmas, rightfully enjoying the holiday off. While the food for our Christmas dinner was delicious, we had a different waiter and a completely opposite experience. Our Christmas Eve dinner was a perfectly timed meal. By contrast, our Christmas dinner went well over 2 hours and service was abysmal at best. Our waiter did not have 2 huge parties to deal with (that I could see). Perhaps he was handling a larger service area - but that's a concern that management should address in order to insure excellent service matches a great meal. Our experience began well enough - bread and water appeared within a reasonable time. So far, so good. Our salads arrived, we ate, our plates and cutlery were cleared, our glasses refilled and then...we waited and waited, and then waited some more. At this point, I had to take a ""bio-break"" after consuming plenty of sparkling water. Mind you, the restrooms are clear across the casino from the restaurant. After returning from my expedition, our entrées were still incognito. We were finally (and kindly) asked by the busboy, if we would like to see the dessert menu!! My mandible hit the proverbial floor (in this case, table top) - I picked up said mandible, reattached it to my maxilla, and informed the busboy that we had not yet received our entrées. His expression of total surprise served to confirm that our wait was indeed, excessive. Our waiter then appeared; apologized for the long wait and made the excuse that, because I went to the restroom, they didn't want our food to get cold. Mind you, we're going on 2 hours now so there is no excuse to be made. Especially one based on my excursion to the much needed restroom (water closet more aptly called in my case.) He brought our entrées and quickly disappeared. With a grumbling stomach (well, not the only piece of my anatomy that was grumbling), I looked down to realize our cutlery had not been replaced... Ah, the crowning glory of it all. Okay, my civility finally flew out the restaurant (there are no windows nearby). I confess that I loudly announced, ""We need forks and knives!! Or, shall we just use our hands?"" Kudos to the busboy who was quick to apologize (without excuse), brought us our cutlery and we were finally eating our Christmas meal. We did receive the requisite complementary desert. Plus, in honor of Christmas, I received a wrapped up chocolate brownie with a coupon for a small discount toward our next visit. Upon returning back home and opening the brownie, said coupon had an expiration date of 12/31/10....ouch.
It is good food, I'd rate CP higher, except the bad experience canceled out the first great one. I'd go back for the food - but not on a holiday and definitely not when it's busy. Dinner at 4:30pm perhaps? Bah humbug!!",2011-01-03 20:44:48

Disclaimer: the manager knew of my previous review and knew I was there when I went again. Because of this, I tried to pay attention to the other food being plated around us to make sure we weren't the exception. 

When I spoke with the manager when we got there, he said that they had been able to train his staff more closely in the kitchen on how to prepare Asian dishes, which has helped considerably in the cook of the dishes. He also mentioned that they had updated their menu to include some new food and cocktail options and plans to have a rotating menu with more items added in the future, which I love the idea of. But, let's get to the food...

This experience was leaps and bounds better than the last time we went. I was extremely pleased with everything that we tried. I went with a group of 5 and we ended up trying most of the menu. I enjoyed everything I got. Both the flavor and the cook was on point; evidence of the kitchen staff's extra training for sure. Here's what we had and what I thought:

Drinks (all not strong but good flavors):
-Cinnabon Scott - nice, fall-ish drink
-Tartbreaker - so tasty! I loved this one with its spiced pear flavor 
-Eye Mizu - hubby ordered this and I tried it and really enjoyed it. The aperol is not strong so it doesn't overpower the other flavors in the drink. I would have ordered this if I had wanted a 3rd

Food:

-Banchan & kimchi - I loved all of them but the kimchi was the best 
-Dumplings - so much better this time around! More flavor and better cook. I love that the cabbage makes the filling purple too
-scallion pancake - guys, this dish was by far the most improved. It wasn't greasy this time and it had its own flavor instead of tasting bland. I enjoyed it this go around 
-glass noddles - amazing! This is definitely the best item on the menu. Fresh with really good flavor.
-fried chicken - good cook, good flavor, solid item
-fried pork katsu - excellent
-beef bulgogi - this was my least favorite as it didn't have as much flavor as all the other items. I've had the pork and really liked it in the past so I would recommend that over the beef.

*did not get to try the bulgogi and kimchi fried rice again, but it will be on my list for next time.

Like I said before, I was paying attention to the other tables and everything else looked like it was cooked just as well. This is a fun little place and I'm so glad our experience this time was better since we live right around the corner. We will be working it into our regular rotations of restaurants.

Way to go Babo for making improvements and adjustments!!",2019-08-30 21:57:36

This is the most popular location in Florida for a very good reason. The staff is absolutely amazing and the food quality is better than other 'fancy' places around Tampa. I've been coming here for years and the quality is consistent, if not improving as of lately.

ATMOSPHERE: This place gets busy (and I stress busy) on weekends during dinnertime. However, the staff handles it very well. While you may wait a bit to get a table, there is a waiting area with seating in which you can eat peanuts and toss the shells on the floor like a boss. I've brought my dad here many times and he love to discard his peanut shells on the floor always telling me ""I love this place because it reminds me of an old fashioned country bar"". This part is free :). The rest of the restaurant is fabulous as well...fits the theme to a T. Texas that is. Wood seats, an open kitchen where you can see your steaks before you order them, a saddle for birthday guests, a great bar area...nothing to say nay to. 

FOOD/DRINKS: Fantastic. Never had a bad meal here. I'll start with the steaks...soooo delicious! Two of my friends have brought me in here (as employees) and told me to order the steak. I absolutely love the sirloin and have found it to be perfectly cooked every single time. I like a medium rare steak and Roadhouse does it so well. The steak fries and mashed potatoes are awesome loaded or not loaded. I must take a moment to point out the Caesar salad. Probably the best Chicken Caesar Salad I've ever had in my life. They make the dressing in house and the ingredients are super fresh. Appetizers are all amazing as well. They have big beers for great prices and the margaritas with tequila shooters ($1 extra). The rolls are addictive with cinnamon butter...I've heard several people ask for an order and then a to-go box just for these rolls! If you like buckets of peanuts to toss on the floor, this is your place to dine as well. 

Overall, I would highly recommend Texas Roadhouse if you want to eat well for a good price, want to gather with friends, want to bring the kiddies out for a great meal, or simply want to indulge in an awesome steak around the Wesley Chapel area. Great management, staff and bartenders. I'll continue to return.",2016-02-29 04:35:44

In addition this is a disclaimer that I have rarely ever given a rating this low. However I am honest in my reviews. 

 We dined in their outdoor area that is on the street now due to covid19 and there was hardly anyone there on a Saturday afternoon. At first, the service was okay and running smoothly. But once the food came out we were not given chopsticks until way after we were finished and the sushi was awful. I am being completely honest when I say this was the worst sushi I've ever had. I've had sushi at this particular spot before too and it was fine. We got the lunch specials and the seafood soup was good and flavorful. You can't beat a lunch special that for 8 bucks. The side salads were not good as the dressing was not too good of a ginger dressing, which typically is such an easy one to make as I make it myself at home. I ordered one of the raw fish rolls on the lunch menu and the person I was with ordered the shrimp tempura and it was so bad that it was inedible. The tempura was gooey and raw, basically was not cooked properly. In addition the rice on the rolls, including mine was mushy, slimy, and squished together. This is not how sushi rice is supposed to be and ruined the roll. There was also way too much mayo on the rolls which personally I wish places didn't even put it on a roll, especially raw rolls. I went ahead and ate this roll but we alerted the server of the awfulness of the tempura rolls as only one piece was eaten because it was that bad. The server then said that they would they could do and didn't return for 10+ minutes and decided to take $1 off by charging a full salad and soup. This made no since so we let the server know whom then said there is no manager so that's what I can do. Then we were brought two separate checks which wasn't polite as if you aren't going to put everything on one you should ask and not make assumptions. 

This was crazy to hear, how was there no manager or assistant manager, or even shift supervisor on duty. So then we asked for a manager number and circled the restaurant phone number on the receipt to call and had an awful attitude during this entire time. All this server needed to do was make this situation right because I've been in customer service in the past and the customer is always right whether you like it or not. Further, the server needed to know that whomever was making sushi was not making sushi properly, this is important so that other people dining didn't get such awful rolls as well. 

This experience was terrible and left such a bitter taste in my mouth that unfortunately I will not be returning to forty five degrees. 

If you are reading this and are wanting to try out this restaurant that is up to your discretion as I used to enjoy this spot but no longer do. One bad experience can make such a difference. I may have returned if the service was good throughout the entire dining experience but it was not. I hope some changes are made so this place thrive and not wilt up.",2020-07-21 12:35:09
B7-Ym8cL_5I-2-gOYRFG6Q,eSJS7-KkvxWRao-6gy8blg,EYoA7Zwg92rDj6pMAQQLTA,3.0,2,0,0,"This was my third time at this resort in the past 18 months and the first two times were so great I was raving to everyone about it.  This time was a real let-down and I sincerely hope it was just a glitch because you couldn't ask for a more beautiful setting for a hotel.  Tucson Mountain Park is across from it and offers nice trails that are easily managed with sneakers.  The resort grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. The employees are pleasant and friendly.  I'm happy to say that the outdoor patio with gas fire pits was every bit as wonderful as the first two times - there is no nicer spot to enjoy the moon and stars and twinkling valley lights that I can think of.     

Now on to the bad news.  When we checked in I asked for a room with a balcony that had an open railing (vs. the masonry closures that block part of the view) - we were told there aren't any of those at the resort (I thought I remembered them from previous visits but she insisted that there weren't any).  After unpacking all our stuff, I went out for a walk around the hotel and saw that there were dozens of rooms with the open type of railing and chairs on the balcony, just as I requested.  When I went back to the desk to ask about it they offered to move us to one of those rooms but I really wasn't up to repacking and moving and unpacking again so we didn't bother.  It was disappointing and irritating, to say the least.  

As it happened, we should have repacked and moved.  Our room had the odor of stale cigarette smoke coming through the HVAC - completely unacceptable, especially for a Marriott property.  We turned off the HVAC and one night even slept with the slider door open to try to alleviate it.  Ridiculous and ultimately useless - we ended up leaving a night earlier than our reservation.

There is a fabulous restaurant on the premises called Primo that we've enjoyed previously and we were eager to eat there again.  The restaurant info was prominently displayed by the elevator to our room.  So we went the first night.  It was closed.  The next day we called the front desk to ask if it would be open and were told it would.  So we went again.  It was closed.  Really unprofessional for a resort of this ilk and well below the Marriott brand (especially JW).  The good news is that the concierge recommended Maynard's Kitchen in downtown Tucson (see my review) which was just outstanding and we were thrilled to discover it.  

As I said, I hope they get their act together.  It's too nice a place to let it fall off.",2012-01-08 21:45:39

That's really excellent, I honestly mean that because he was very apologetic for my negative experience, said he would talk to the appropriate employees involved and really handled a negative situation much better than some other fancy hair salons would have handled the situation, so for that, I upgraded my review to 3 stars.  

I had a great experience here once and the second time wasn't as good because I was rushed in and out, I left with wet toenails because they were closing.  I also have discomfort from a toenail cut too short and from my callouses which were removed.  It was also a bit awkward when the tech asked me to Venmo her a tip because they do not accept tips on cards.  Unfortunately, these were negative experiences and I do hope that I am in less discomfort from the pedicure which I hoped to be relaxing.  I have an appointment at the podiatrist tomorrow about my toes, and I'm frustrated because this is the second nail salon that I've had negative experiences with.  I unfortunately did need to have an ingrown toenail removed at the podiatrist from my pedicure here which was very painful.  To this salons credit, it may have been an ingrown nail from City Nails before coming here but coming here made it worse.  I have also heard from my podiatrist that the cutting off of callouses is illegal!  Both these nail salons do that.  There is a higher risk for infection!  

The pedicure was nice, paraffin wax, although that does burn my skin, but the leg massage, hot towels, free beverage including wine was a nice touch, they have lots of glam mags, not sure if they still offer the free snacks.  I was very relaxed for the most part except for the negative parts which I have described but I'm very pleased to have been refunded my amount of my pedicure in full.  I think refunding and apologizing for a negative experience is excellent customer service, I think that more salons should mirror after this level of customer service, I don't know if I will return again after the negative experience but I do greatly appreciate the refund.  Weird that they saved my card information to process the refund- ugh.  I think next time I will try Lacquer Lounge or go back to some other nail salons that I really enjoyed.  It's too bad because I would really like to keep patronizing this nail salon but I have left with an upsetting experience- again, thanks for the refund though!",2018-04-16 13:22:35

   Walked in on a whim with a friend, seated, no problem.  Two gals next to us were there before us.  Ten minutes later the ONLY waiter in the place comes and gives us menus (no doubt, organically made).  Comes back almost 10 mins later (now at almost 20 mins).  I knew it was a mistake at this point so I figured, how does one screw up a burger ($18.00) and a shake.  Waiter comes over, takes our beverage order, but before he could run away again, woah, we'll order now.  
   Shake come out, it was WARM chocolate milk, GROSS.  If there was any ice cream in it, maybe a table spoon.  Forever later, the burger comes out.  I cut it in half, looked raw, but maybe it was the cut of beef they use.  I took a bite, freakin raw and I mean uncooked.  Waiter goes to the two gals sitting next to us and says, ""sorry, your pizza fell on the floor in the kitchen, we'll have to make you another one"".  They must have been there for 35 mins or more. That's what you tell a customer??  How about, we had some issues in the kitchen, I'm so sorry for the wait, I'd like to comp your beverages and buy you ladies a dessert.
   I'm queezy now and just want to get the freak outta there.  I'm trying to get the waiters attention, just can't, busy running around.  Not his fault, it was ridiculously under staffed.  Finally, he is making some drinks and I get his attention.  Essentially I had to ask him to come to the table for I was trying to be polite; or I could have yelled to him that everything was terrible.  He finally walks over, show him that he doesn't know what a simple shake is and the food wasn't cooked.  Says he was sorry, takes it away and that's it.  I want to pay and leave, fast.  He comes over to the table doesn't charge me for the meal I didn't eat, not apologetic just running around.  Best part he tells me, I talked to the cook and they're going to get a meat thermometer.  You don't have one????  You need one to cook a burger???

For some of yous..this is your first time hearing about it. Now lets skip forward and let me tell you the tale of the ""Gentlemans Club"" with two names. Is this place ""Platnum Dolls"" or is it ""Peppermint Hippo?"" well it forsure is the other mint and a whole different animal if you get my drift..only some will get what I ment about that statement lol. But the entertainment here was indeed on a different level and I have to say that for birthday festivities, on a ""bronze, silver, or gold"" scale this one is definitely ""platnum"" status. Seeing I don't venture to these establishments too often anymore, (Not that we could even if we wanted too in the last year or so) but this time was a celebration and I needed some..""therapy"" yet let's just run with that. Now let me tell you why ""Peppermint"" with always be a cool ""Hippo"" in my book..

""Peppermint Hippo""
Location - Reno, Nv
Price - $25.00 x5
Entertainment - Well, let's just say money was spent :)

Peppermint Hippo Reno:
The ""Peppermint Hippo"" is a fairly newer brand in the nightlife industry. The cartoon ""South Park"" did parody the name in reference to the Deja Vu owned ""Spearmint Rhino"" (my pun from earlier) and this club is new to Reno..kinda. Even the staff here is getting use to the new moniker and the comparisons to the other minty animal club. Reno has it's options for Gentlemans Club/Cabarets in the area, but this one was a no brainer from my initial call to check on accomodations for my homies and I. The hostess on the phone here was a lot more friendly as compared to two other similar establishments I called and they were nice enough to make sure my party had a spot reserved for our visit upon arrivial.

We arrived and received some of the best service I've experienced in a while in this type of establishment and we even were given a cocktail waitress to tend to our table. The main thing about ""Gentlemans Clubs"" is making sure the patron is happy, the drinks are good and the entertainment aspect of the establishment is top notch. I would step out on a limb and say they knocked it out of the park in every area. Like if I lived in Reno, this would be a place I would definately like to work for....not for the reasons that some may be thinking. The DJ wasn't annoying as some could get and the..entertainment for the night was indeed entertaining. The lighting matched the overall theme of the club although outside....it goes back to that little tale of two clubs thing (Signage still says Platnum Dolls). I will say at the end of my visit, I was satisfied and the impression left was pretty good.

Overall:
""Peppermint Hippo"" is a pretty nice establishment. It's got everything you would expect for the type of business it is. The service was supurb, the venue itself was very well kept and classy, and the overall vibe is just what I was looking for being a visitor to a establisment that is similar to ones I've worked for in the past. I would recommend this club to anyone looking to have a good evening out with friends. If you're a creepazoid however....don't go here killing the vibe. I would be visiting this club of two names again in the near future.",2021-05-12 06:09:52

My roommates and I had just finished a night at a comedy show where we had been drinking a little and wanted to get some quick food before we went home (we're grandmas, so this was around 8:45pm). Now I know that Jack in the box isn't like some 5 star high end quality food, but when you go through a fast food drive thru, the ONE thing you want out of the whole experience is to get your food FAST. 

We ordered around 8:45pm, and when we got to the window, we waited about 5 full minutes before the guy came out and took our card to pay. We're still waiting there for our food (our order was pretty standard by the way: 3 orders of curly fries, a burger, chicken strips. Nothing complicated.)
15 minutes later, we still don't have our food. The guy says they're ""swamped"" and only have 3 people working, and asks us if we can pull around to the front of the restaurant and he'll bring our food out to us. That just sounded weird to me but of course we do it because we don't know any better and we really thought that by listening to this employee that we would get our food like, at a decent time. We're waiting outside parked in front of this freaking establishment for about 30 minutes, it's about 9:30pm. My friend walks in and stands in front of the counter to see what's up. There's NOT that many people inside (like maybe 4 people waiting for their food). Also, I understand if you're understaffed and ""swamped."" But doesn't it make sense to give the people food who ordered it first??? Like why would you keep making other people's orders if there's clearly people who have already paid for their food and still haven't gotten it? Like if you're swamped, just stop taking orders at the drive thru for a second and make someone's food.

They tried to give us a free cheesecake slice at around 9:40 when they finally started packing our food together. I ended up asking the employee if it was okay to get a full refund, because this was unreasonable to wait 45 minutes to get food and have to bug the employees over and over to not forget that we were still waiting. The manager came out and thankfully refunded me on my card (I haven't actually gotten it yet but she said it would take a couple days).
I'm glad they agreed to this because otherwise I would probably never give jack in the box my business ever again.",2018-08-04 21:34:48

I fell in love with the merchandise and ended up purchasing a couch and bed, which was to be delivered on a Saturday. Saturday rolled around and I got a call that my furniture would arrive within a three hour time slot. Once the delivery guys got to my building, one called asking me what floor I lived on and if I had an elevator. I do not, I live in a three-story walk up on the third floor. I greeted one delivery guy at the door. He said, ""you ordered a queen size bed, right?"" I told him yes and he told me that there was a king size bed on the truck.  I'm sure he knew they had the wrong size bed prior to arriving to my place. I'm assuming he was too lazy to carry it up the steps. That was the first thing to annoy me. So him and another guy wheeled my couch to the entrance of my apartment building only for him to tell me my couch would not fit. Not once did he lift the couch and make an attempt to bring it inside of my apartment building. He asked me if I had a measuring tape so he could measure the doors. I told him no and one magically appeared from his pocket. He measured the door entrance and told me again that the couch I paid for would not fit. I was livid. He rudely shrugged his shoulders and said there was nothing else he could do. He told me I had to sign some paperwork so he could take the furniture back and call my sales rep, Mike. Mike apologized and told me he would have the furniture delivered Monday evening. It was around 6:30pm and I still had not received a call regarding the delivery. I called the store and let a woman know what was going on. She said she would call me back. About 40 minutes passed and I received no call. I called the store back only for that woman to tell me the delivery guys were stuck in Lafayette, IN and couldn't make it to Indianapolis that night. I hung up and called Mike's cell phone. He did not answer, so I sent him a text about how unprofessional this experience had been. About two hours later he called me back. He wasn't exactly nice about the situation. I told him I need my furniture to be delivered by 8am the next day and not to send the same rude delivery guy from Saturday. Mike told me that wasn't possible to deliver that early.  I let him know that if I did not have my furniture I'd be returning to the store for a full refund. At 7:15am the next morning, I got a call from a different delivery guy saying he'd be at my house in 30 minutes.  In 30 minutes he was there. It was a different guy. He began bringing my bed upstairs, then that same guy from Saturday brought pieces of my bed into my apartment. I was extremely annoyed that they sent one of the same guys from Saturday. They set my bed up and the new delivery guy told me they were going to bring my couch up. FIVE minutes later my couch was in my apartment. I don't know how Saturday it wouldn't fit, but Tuesday it did. Must have been magic. I returned to the store after the delivery guys left and asked to speak with Mike. He was conveniently in a meeting. I demanded some type of refund for the hassle. They returned the delivery and set-up fee. NEVER AGAIN WILL I SHOP THERE!",2015-05-04 19:23:27

I hear it all the time. My answer? Well, I know how to cook and I saved my pennies throughout the year! Put on your best outfit and let's go!!!

I've have two different fondue experiences at The Melting Pot. Both were equally satisfying. Very romantic feel, laid back and good music.

I'm not going to go deep into details about my experiences, but yet, I'm going to take a different approach. Guys, this is a place to take your chick! You want to impress your woman? You want to get some cool points? This is the place to do so! Right here!

Great wine selections. Make sure you order by the bottle instead of by the glass. It's much cheaper that way.

Your fondue experience kicks off with the cheese fondue with all the breads, veggies and apples. Take your fondue fork and get to dipping! The cheese is so good! I think it's called the Beer Cheese Fondue that we tried. After your cheese fondue, you get your salad while your broth is boiling on the table. Then all the excitement begins when the raw chicken, steak, shrimp, duck and pork is brought to your table! Stab your different selections of meats with your fork, put it in the pot and let it sit there for a couple of minutes. Everything you put in and take out of that pot will make you shake your head in shame. How can that broth make everything so good?? I don't get it. It's some of the best food i've ever had. I can't even describe it like most people can, so ill just try my best. It's so good! Then the chocolate fondue. I'm not really big on sweets but i really enjoyed the experience. Strawberries and brownies to dip. It's a great ending to a romantic evening.

Although the Melting Pot is one of the best restaurants i've ever experienced, it's something I can't do every month...more like annually. Special occasions like anniversaries or that first date with a chick you just met and want to impress! Haha! Also, don't let people get you down about the whole ""you gotta cook your own food"" thing. You're missing out if you think that way. You have to experience it. That's the only way I can break it down to you!",2012-12-15 21:51:48

Their staff is always very friendly and very well spoken.  That's about the only good.  We have been a service contract customer for many years and at first everything seemed fine.  Fine not great as we had several repairs done which required us calling them out a second or third time to fix issues that were left uncorrected.  At this point i would say shame on me.  I should have worked harder to find another company but life is busy and finding contractors is hard and time consuming.  that being said after several thousand dollars all of our problems were resolved.  Then last year the annual fall or spring service visit felt a lot like a sales call and not a service call.  The guy was trying really hard to get us to think about replacing the AC unit, which was not new but not crazy old either, especially considering the evap. coil had been replaced with the furnace.  We opted not to pursue that with Cardwell.  We sold that house and moved to a new home in August (where the AC worked fine) and got a service contract again with Cardwell.  They came out for the winter service and once again the technician tried to convince us to replace the AC unit which was 4 years old!  No way!  This spring for the summer AC start up they tell us our unit is completely out of refrigerant and offer us options well above a thousand dollars, $95 / lb for 410 A and the same $95 / pound for Nitrogen to leak test.  Just to leak check the unit not even repair it!  I said no.  I called out another company.  Turns out the valve, front an center on the unit was stuck open and leaking.  Remember the unit worked in the summer and the only person to touch the unit was a Cardwell tech. who wanted to sell me a new system to replace a 4 year old unit.  I'm not sure what conclusions to draw from this but my gut says there's a shady business practice at work.  I gave them 2 stars because they are easy to reach, call you back and have  always been on time.  That said i would never recommend them to anyone as I simply do not trust the company or their business practices.  Not to mention insanely high prices.",2021-05-27 15:13:14

Maybe it's the friendly service, or the beautiful presentations that make me hungry before I taste the food.  Maybe it's the gorgeous woodwork in the restored mansion.  Those are nice, but the food is down right delicious!  Ya, it's the food!

I don't know exactly why it took me so long to dine here, but I am so glad I did.  I took my wife on Wednesday for lunch and we knew immediately that we wanted to sit outside on the patio.  We could have selected the gazebo, but the wrought iron chairs and tables looked comfy enough.
  
We were greeted immediately and quickly had our drinks served.  After a few minutes, we placed our orders.

My wife opted for the Prime Rib Sandwich with Kettle Chips.  The sandwich was served on ciabatta bread with white cheddar and carmelized onions. On the side were three cups:  one was an au jus; one a horseradish dipping sauce (think spicy brown mustard); and the third was a white creamy sauce (maybe a mayo).  The beef was served ""cold"", but was actually warm and juicy.  The cheddar was melted and soft, but not stringy.  The onion was cut into large pieces that added a nice sweetness to go with the sharp taste of the horseradish.  Very tasty!

I opted for the Maryland Crab Cakes.  Each of the four cakes was served on a warm lemon slice.  An ornamental pattern of three colorful sauces highlighted the visuals of the plate.  The sauces were made from peanuts (light brown color), sriracha (red color), and wasabi (light green color).  The flavors worked incredibly well together with the crab.  I didn't consider the sauces too spicy although my wife thought they had some kick to them.  Highly recommended!
 
I also couldn't resist ordering the Asparagus in a Blanket which I thoroughly enjoyed on my previous visit.  The asparagus (thin pieces, not giant tree-sized pieces) was wrapped in Filo dough with prosciutto and Gruyere cheese.  These are baked to crisp the dough which adds a wonderful buttery flavor to the mix.  The blankets are criss-crossed like lincoln logs and have a decorative splash of the same three sauces as the crab cakes.  The flavors worked exceptionally well here as well.  Delicious!  So glad they didn't take it off the menu.

Sure, it is a bit pricey for a lunch, but the menu items are the same size as what I could get at dinner, so I don't put artificial price restrictions when it comes to time of day.  If the food is 5 star, I am willing to pay for 5 star.  

Oh, and they have a large variety of wines  (hence the name).  The wines are available from the store (to go) or can be purchased for dinner.  Note:  Since the same type of wine is available in both the store and the restaurant, there is a separate line item on your bill if you purchase an entire bottle for your meal.  I fully understand that most places just tell you a price without the breakout.....I've always paid more for beverages at a restaurant than at a store.  Don't let the extra fee surprise you and ruin an otherwise fantastic dining experience.

We arrived about 7:00 pm on a Saturday night to a packed parking lot and dining room.  Fully expected to wait but instead we were promptly greeted, handed the large menu and asked to sit in the waiting area while they cleaned some tables.  A few minutes later another lady brought us to our table, our server came by, laid out some set ups and asked for our drink order.  They were keeping things moving.  
Shortly, our server came back to take the order.  We wanted to try the small steamed buns first but she told us they weren't really appetizers and that they could come out later so, OK, and we also ordered the tomato beef stew, cumin lamb and the Yu-xiang eggplant knowing full well that we'd have some leftovers.  
Then wifey went to look at the cold dishes (on display in the front counter) and got some goodies there as well for an appetizer.  You can see in the picture, we had seaweed, cucumbers, tofu and wood ears.  They were excellent.  Not usually a sea weed fan, but these were nice and crunchy even though the taste might be a little hard core if you're not used to it.  But for us, we rather enjoyed them.
Then the small steamed buns came out, surprise, surprise.  It didn't take that long after all and I'm thinking that our server was listening to our request to get them out first.  Unfortunately, they were not that good.  Not that they were bad, just not the Din Tai Fung quality we thought would be getting.  Certainly, there was no juice inside but rather a little dipping sauce on the side.  Not impressed and recommend that you don't bother with them either unless you really need them.  There are some other pot stickers on the menu that might be more worth your time.  
But then things got much better.  First, the server seemed to make sure we had an appropriate amount of time to eat the steamed buns before bringing out the main dishes.  The tomato and beef stew was a hearty bowl of tender beef and tomatoes in a rich, hearty and flavorful gravy.  The cumin lamb was more than I could have hoped for with the cumin perfectly matched to the lamb and, as it turned out, well blended to the slight sweetness of the beef and tomatoes.  Not to be outdone, the eggplant were long strips, lightly battered and fried to perfection with a slight sweet and pepper sauce.  I just want you to know how good it was.  To get all those flavors on your plate and let them mingle just a bit along with a little rice (served in two small rice bowls - at no extra charge) was just perfect.
Our server, by the way, was just so sweet as well.  She checked on us several times and even brought me a drink refill, just the way I like it, at about half way through our meal. She knew what she was doing.  
So, yes, we were pleasantly happy with our dining experience here tonight.  We hope they can maintain this.  Quality food, served at a very reasonable pace by friendly servers.  We look forward to coming back and trying some more of the selections from their vast menu.  Highly recommend you go and check them out.",2019-05-26 04:51:02

Never been there before, and I'm away for college so I figure I buy a groupon and take my mom and my sister out. When we we first walked in, the ambience was great. We had a reservation, and we seated immediately.  After that, things went down hill. We were placed with the MOST condescending, demeaning, and disrespectful waiter I've ever experienced..truly unprofessional. We ordered appetizers and I am allergic to foods with a high garlic content. I don't know why, but I just break out in hives. Anyway, I asked that they not include the garlic aioli, and he gave me another one of his strange looks. I asked if there was a problem, and he said he won't remove the garlic sauce, but he would just put it on the side. I said no, just completely remove it. I don't want it on the side--I don't want it at all. Why he was so insistent the garlic sauce came with my food..I will never know. I was pretty annoyed at this point. He was also very demeaning to my sister, she used all of her forks, and he had to add a side note, ""oh wow, I've never seen anyone use all of their forks before. I'll get you a new one."" I ordered my entree and a side of steak fries. Again, I didn't want the garlic sauce, but he said he will leave it on the side, I said I don't want the sauce at all. What is so difficult to understand, and why are you questioning my requests. Just take it out, I even had to ask myself if I was asking for too much? But come on even at Burger King, you can request no cheese on your burger and they won't put cheese on the burger. Can you imagine if they deny your request, and okay we won't put it on the burger...but we'll put in a small bag for you on the side?! That's a waste of cheese because I'm not going to eat it. Regardless, I asked for ketchup with my fries, and before serving me my ketchup first, he served me one of his condescending looks and said ""uh okay?"" At this point, I was over this restaurant. This restaurant is maybe one notch better than Red Lobster. Don't let the fact that you are sitting on a boat fool you, it doesn't even move!!!! Another huge disappointment. The fact that it doesn't sail is slightly tacky in my eyes, there is no advantage between dining here and dining at the Hyatt down the street. If it doesn't sail, that takes away from the experience. Enough of that tangent! So the bill comes, and I pull up my groupon, and he says ""Oh, I'm sorry you can't use this. There has to be atleast 4 or more people in your party."" It look everything in me to remain calm. The manager walked over to assist us, and he made a bunch of cheap and dry jokes about my fashion. I explained to him, I am a college student and I don't live in the area anymore, I bought this groupon to try this place out and to have a last girls night with my mother and sister. The groupon was $49 for $100 worth in food. Our bill was $124.00. The manager first agreed to only remove the face value of $49. I disagreed, I wasn't going to pay $80.00 for something I only intended to pay $20-30 extra dollars for. Even though $120.00 isn't bad. I spent that at pf changs last week. Regardless, no one is going to pay more than what they expected. He finally agreed to take $100 off, and made another dry joke about how he could tell I was from New York from my amazing fashion. I wasn't sure where he was going with that, but I wasn't finding it funny. Finally, our waiter that earned a pretty nice tip considering he was beyond rude came up to me and said enjoy your trip back to New York. I though how rude! Especially since I told his manager I was living in New York, not him. He wasn't even around when I said that. I felt he was over stepping his boundaries. Anyway, food was mediocre. Service was terrible. Ambiance was great. Two stars. Nothing spectacular. There are better dining experiences in Philly.  Highly disappointed.",2014-03-22 11:42:35

The shepherd's pie, tortiere, mac & cheese, jasmine rice, curry dishes and salads are quite good.  The chef's here seem to put some creativity and skill into their fare and this is novel in Edmonton as gourmet take out is really a sad a-fare.  It is nice to see as well the use of local farms for eggs, vegetables and sausages.  Prices are not bad considering the quality of ingredients that are going into the dishes, particularly compared to the garbage that is sold in grocery store delis such as Safeway, Sobey's, Save-On, etc.

Update:  I have been patronizing the Careit Deli at the Crestwood location for about three years now.  I am now lowering my first review which I rated four stars to now a three star. 

  Reasons:  creativity of the dishes has staled and not changed much over time.  I keep seeing the same butter chicken, veggie chili, shepherd's pie and I have just about purchased all that they offer in the ready made section.  While pretty good, with prices at $16.95 for the large size of butter chicken, lasagna, shepherd's pie, etc. and the large easily feeds two people.  Coconut Rice tray goes for $5.95 and is the smaller size.  

I am really tired of seeing the same old bread pudding with the caramel sauce:  not a bad dessert but bread pudding can be soggy and find the one sold here does tend to get onto the wet side.

The chocolate mousse needs to be reconfigured.  The chocolate mousse has a terrible 'mouth feel', not smooth and creamy; what seems to be a gritty ground coffee texture.  

Pies are really good:  small single serve is $5.95 and larger pie runs about $14.95.

Salads are really good and sell for $10.95 for a chef's salad made out of lettuce leaves, goat cheese, dried cranberries, and candied walnuts (they need to be really careful with the amount of sugar that they put on these walnuts...too overwhelming) but this salad is really divine due to the most fantastic vinigrette dressing made out of the basil, oil, apple juice, maple syrup - this emulsion is divine and sold on it's own it goes for $2.00 for four ounces.

But all in all, I would like to see these chef's offer more on the ready made section, the standbys are good but as mentioned above, I am tired of them and yearn for something different.",2010-04-10 04:06:31

Kidding. I was psyched to try out Tired Hands as it is a much buzzed about new place in my old haunt. I don't currently live that far away yet I rarely find myself in this area anymore. Just driving there was literally a trip down memory lane even though the landscape of Ardmore has changed drastically. 

From riding my bike to Ardmore West to eat from Roy Rogers "" Fixin's Bar"" ( now a McDonalds) and rushing into Kiddie City to covet the latest Star Wars figures and Atari 2600 games ( now a strip mall) to driving a police car through the area as a Lower Merion cop, this area holds a ton of lasting memories for me.

Since there's only street parking in front of TH, I parked only a block away in the big lot behind the Ardmore movie theater ...Er Philly Sports Club, which is free after 6pm. 
Hands is located towards the end of Ardmore ave at Lancaster, which was previously a section pretty much unmemorable to me as a youth, so I didn't feel any resentment towards the new place.

My initial impression of the space  is that it is very charming and rustic. They left the foundation pretty much as is and have focused more on the beer and food. It reminds me a lot of my favorite bars in the city Doobies and even more so, The Institute.

The staff was great and all seemed excited to be a part of something like this. I didn't spend a lot of time at the bar, but our female bartender upstairs was extremely friendly, helpful and knowledgable  about the beer and food options. 

I had come for the UYE thrown by McThrill and we ended up having to push a bunch of tables together due to the amazing turnout. Our server did about as good a job as he could do with such a large and constantly seat shifting group. 

All of what I just described is peripheral filler, because this is a place of food and spirits so its time to dish on the dishes. Previous to coming, the 2 things I heard is that the beer is fantastic ...but eat elsewhere. I found this statement to be a bit skewered. First, the beer. 

There's no doubt that its well made beer, it's just for my taste, I found it too hoppy. I prefer darker beers from Lager to Stout and Tired Hands seems to concentrate on Pale Ales, and IPAs. I am by no means saying they aren't good, for what they were they were wonderful, it's just not my preference. The bartender did mention that they sometimes make a porter so I'd be interested to come back and try that. 

When people say not to rely on the food at Tired Hands, it's not because it isn't good. Quite the opposite. I found their offerings to be fresh and tasty. I think what people mean is that it isn't a full menu of substantial meals. On this visit, our large group ordered just about 1 of everything on their menu and what i sampled really hit the spot for me.The  Bread made there  was awesome and this is coming from a baker. They also make their own pickles and have a candied maple bacon that amps flavor to 11. I thoroughly enjoyed the cheese and cured meats platters served with the above mentioned bread. 

Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone wholeheartedly and feel a combination of pride/big brotherness towards Tired Hands. I hope and expect it to do well. While it wouldn't make my 12year old bike rounds it certainly makes my 42 year old bar crawl rounds in the Ardmore area.",2013-09-15 11:45:53
MKw53EZgdpsfBFsXBURREw,kO30XR2WeF6bla6dK1ZZLw,S8ZFYEgMejpChID8tzKo9A,4.0,4,0,1,"Having been to the majority of Iron Chef Jose Garces' restaurants, Tinto remains our absolute favorite. However, Amada is another favorite, and is Chef Garces' first iconic restaurant. Emblematic of a Spanish bodega, the dishes are mainly tapas style - to be shared and certainly enjoyed.

The interior is intimate, with dark tones and wood tables throughout. The dining area is separated off to a bar area, two main dining areas, and a backroom for larger parties and private dining. My sister was in town so the GF and I took her out to Old City to enjoy a gauntlet of Chef Garces' best dishes at Amada.

Amuse
Albacore tuna salad, capers, aged sherry vinegar, garlic flat bread

The kitchen sent out a nice amuse of rich tuna salad, topped with briny capers and an acidic aged sherry vinegar. Crisp garlic flat breads were a nice vessel that also provided texture to each bite.

Ensalada de Jamon [$12]
Serrano and fig salad, Cabrales, spiced almonds

I'm not prone to ordering salads, but if this is how all salads came out, it would be a must. The greens were tossed in a light vinegar dressing, with the figs providing some sweetness, some spice and texture coming from the almonds, and the Cabrales blue cheese bringing out some funk. Oh, and we can't forget that this was all surrounded by a cone of serrano ham - salty, delicate, and greasy in the best way possible. Do order this dish.

Patatas Bravas [$5]
Spicy potatoes

I defer to Marcie Turney for the city's best patatas bravas. Still, these were very good. Crisp on the outside and creamy within, these potatoes were topped by a lightly spicy sauce, with some chili espelette sprinkled on as well.

Queso de Cabra [$8]
Baked goat cheese, tomato, basil, almonds

I couldn't get a sense of where the almonds were in this dish. But no matter. While it wasn't the most exciting dish, that didn't detract from how delicious it was. Served with toast points, how can you go wrong with tomato, basil, and tangy goat cheese baked right in?

Croquetas de Jamon [$6]
Ham croquettes, romesco

These croquettes were deftly fried, with salty bits of ham within. The romesco underneath had a nice nuttiness that was balanced with some acidity. 

Pulpo a la Gallega [$12]
Spanish octopus

If there's a must order dish, I would highly recommend the pulpo. These cephalopods had great char that lent a savory smokiness to each bite, balanced nicely by the chili and a spritz of lemon. The texture within was soft and luscious. Simply delicious.

Esparragos con Trufas [$11]
Grilled asparagus, truffles, poached egg, Mahon crisp

The truffle essence was very slight, but the classic pairing of al dente asparagus and a creamy poached egg was delicious. The Mahon cheese crisp lent a bit of salty texture to each bite.

Datiles con Almendras [$9.50]
Bacon-wrapped Medjool dates, almonds, Cabrales

A skewer of sweet dates and funky Cabrales blue cheese were wrapped with crisp bacon to create a satisfying bite. I appreciated the marinated grapes that were in between to provide some freshness.

Berenjenas [$8]
Roasted eggplant, whipped goat cheese, raisin escabeche

Meaty japanese eggplant were roasted with some balsamic, which lent some acidity that was balanced by the raisin escabeche. The tangy whipped goat cheese also added a nice element to the dish.

Costillas de Ternera [$14]
Beef short ribs, horseradish, Parmesan, bacon 

A close second to the black truffle flat bread at JG Domestic, Amada features rich and tender short rib, salty bacon, and Parmesan on top of crisp, yet pliant flatbread. The horseradish wasn't overpowering, but provided a nice foil to the richness of each bite. 

Wagyu Beef Brochettes [$15]
Fingerling potatoes, bordelaise

While the fingerling potatoes and bordelaise sauce were savory and rich, unfortunately, the beef was overcooked, rendering it chewy and unsatisfying. On the other hand ...

Filet Mignon [$19]
Cabrales, foie gras, swiss chard, tempranillo jus

The filet mignon was cooked perfectly medium rare and extremely tender. The foie gras topping the beef had a perfect sear, to the point that it tasted like liver candy. The red wine jus was a nice complement, with some more of the Cabrales blue cheese providing a foil to the richness of each bite. Highly recommend this dish.

Bunuelos [$9]
Doughnuts, date jam, date & olive oil ice cream 

To end our meal, we decided to get the bunuelos, which featured crusty and not overly greasy doughnuts. It was accompanied by a sweet date jam that was surprisingly subtly sweet along with a date and olive oil ice cream that had interesting texture.

As expected service was exemplary. While we did order a gauntlet of dishes, I was a bit surprised at some of the inconsistencies in cooking. Regardless, Amada did feature some standouts including the pulpo and the filet. The tapas style menu also allows diners to try a variety of dishes to share and enjoy.",2015-03-15 23:45:09
aloFHhhzlEAHF9UJaXlW4A,JufFyHfqqQYJLYelQykOdw,eVhRtjZeO3C4OBDecIQQtA,1.0,10,0,0,"Scam!  Their response to the original review is dishonest.  They DID NOT steer me to a pet in cabin option.  I WAS NOT DISPLEASED WITH PRICING - I was ANGRY at being charged THOUSANDS over what it should have costs.  TUNISIA only requires a USDA vet to do the health certificate NOT APHIS certification they wanted hundreds for!!!! The ""considerable time"" they spent answering questions was me asking why they were trying to defraud me!!! SCAM SCAM SCAM!!!  I HAVE ALL THE EMAILS TO BACK UP THIS REVIEW AND THE NUMBERS QUOTED BELOW.  I have all the evidence saved so I can write this and hopefully save the readers money.   Grossly overpriced and dishonest.  You still have to find your own USDA certified veterinarian, you still have to take your dog to the appointment, and you still have to have them send information to Air animal. Why? If you have a USDA certified vet,  they just fill out the certificate and you mail it to the USDA an overnight envelope. What's worse is what they charge is a total scam! An international health certificate is only about 150$ but they charge an additional 200$ simply to put it in the mail and have it overnighted to the usda is Tallahassee (so like $350 just to Re do the form your vet just did).  What Air Animal didn't bother to tell me was that the APHIS certification WAS NOT NECESSARY because the country I was sending her to did not require it! So,they wanted $200 to address an envelope and address a second envelope to send back to you, and in my case $200 for an unneeded stamp. Then my quote also included $150 for parasite removal. Huh? First, it's not a thing and second the country my pet was going to doesn't require  it.   At first I really wanted to ship with them, because I want my dog with me. But they wanted to charge me $6000, and when I looked into why the price was so high it was because they wanted to charge me $3500 to import her into Europe for about a 12 hour stay, and then send her onto the final destination. I kept asking why are you doing this, and the response was we had to put a number down somewhere to give you a quote. Meaning they didn't know. So not only is it dishonest trying to charge people hundreds of dollars for simple tasks, they are now trying to charge me for things that are not even necessary or required.  For those reading this, I have shipped my dog around the world several times. At the most it is cost me $1500. And that was to the literal other side of the world. You're being taken advantage of and this company is unethical and dishonest. The hardest part about shipping your dog is getting the health certificate. The hardest part of that is finding a vet that will do it- which can be done with a google search. After you get the health certificate from the vet  it's a simple matter of putting it in the mail  overnight to the USDA  including a return envelope to your home address. And NO it's not complicated to fill out and NO air animal doesn't need to ""quality check"" it.  Look online, it's a very simple form.  That's it, that's what they want to charge $400 for.  It is CHEAPER to buy someone a ticket who then can fly with your pet in cabin or at baggage.  I JUST GOT MY DOG TO ME FOR 400$! That's $5600 LESS than they wanted!!!",2019-10-04 19:04:00

It was a delicious sandwich. I wanted soup but didn't think I could finish both. I decided if I liked the sandwich I would come back to try their soup. Looks like I'll be back because the sandwich was pretty great. They have been open a long time (since 2007) and I have been told by several people to try it but I've just never gone. I am happy I did today.

The menu consists of salads, soups and sandwiches and is just the right size. There are enough options for every diet to choose from and then there are daily soups which are on a rotation. The options listed online for today (Thursday) did not match was being sold in person. My brother had the pozole which is one of his and my favorite dishes. He seemed to enjoy it. I wish I tried it because it looked pretty tasty. 

I decided to try the grilled cheese sandwich. It's a very basic sandwich and anyone can make one, or can they? I want a nice crunchy bite when I am eating a freshly grilled cheesy sando. My sandwich today gave me that satisfaction. The bread was toasted just right and the cheese was gooey. I don't know if they put both cheeses in my sandwich. I could only see and taste the sharp cheddar, visually I could not see the white cheddar. I make sandwiches like this often and can always see the white and yellow cheddar melding together when I pull it apart. I did not see this on my sandwich today. This did not effect my enjoyment in any way. I also added prosciutto for $2.50 upcharge. They put in a good amount of it so it was worth the added cost. The sandwich came with a side salad which had mixed greens and cranberry with a dressing I think is balsamic vinaigrette. That cut the fat of the cheese sandwich nicely. 

The space is small and cozy. There are seats outside but it's fall and cold and I'm a baby so we sat inside. The staff was friendly. They were very busy but we didn't have to wait long and the tables were bussed almost as quickly as people were leaving. I enjoyed my visit with my brother while eating some good comfort food. 

I would recommend Sup for lunch or dinner and I will be back to try their actual soup.",2021-12-02 22:43:22

I had previously stayed at this resort and had no problems. The smell of smoke is less noticiable than at other resorts in Reno.  Unfortunatly, this is the only positive thing I have to say.  Our room was okay, but when I went to use the shower, it did not work.  We had to call guest services to have someone come and fix it.  We wondered how housekeeping could actually clean the bathroom & not notice the shower was not working properly. The bathroom also smelled like mold.  Again I wish this was the worse thing I had to say.  Upon checking out I retrieved my car from the free valet service.  I had accidentally forgotten a bag of merchandise I had purchased the night before.  Thinking it was safe because it was in valet I did not worry too much.  Big mistake! Upon entering my car I noticed the center console was open and my home phone charger & a pack of gum wre missing.  I was irritated, but then I looked in the backseat & noticed my bag of was missing.  I alterted the valet and they forwarded me to security.  While waiting to talk to security (they were busy with other incidents) a lady next to me was reporting a bag was missing from her car as well and the sercurity manager was busy with another group with problems.  I have little faith that they will actually find out what happened to my belongings and filed a report with Reno PD because I feel my bag could easily be hidden in the valet's bulky jacket.  Will not stay there again.
**** Update 12/27   After failing to get back to me as they stated they would, I finally spoke to someone about my case.  I knew from the start they would CYA on this, but they have left me with my integrity being questioned. First they could not prove that my car was parked in valet because they had no record of it being there.  He asked me if I could provide the valet ticket. Of course not since the attendant took it when I retrieved my car.  So of course the surveillance was dark and inconclusive, I'm not even sure how they new it was my car.  How can I expect them to be able to investigate this theft, if they can't even keep track of a car for one night.  Then he asked how I could prove that these items were in my car, like I took a picture of everything that was in my car before it left me.  So unless you have a itemized, notarized list of what is in your car before you leave it with the valet you may not want to use their services.  Also you probably should  photocopy the ticket so you can prove that it was there.  Although he did tell me that now they are aware of the problem they are taking steps to correct the problem.",2016-12-19 01:01:27

Me and my friend had an issue in the past with this same location, and the manager graciously gave us a $30 gift card. So we went for dinner at another Texas Roadhouse to use our gift card. Come to find out- the gift card wasn't ever activated. The manager was nice about it though, and gave us another one to use on this visit. I love Texas Roadhouse usually- the environment, the friendliness, and the food is always amazing!

However this time, we walked into the restaurant, and stood there for a few minutes. No one even acknowledged us. Even one of the managers was standing next to us, and did not say hello, or even nod our way. Now, this is definitely not how my experience usually goes, so I shrugged it off, and hoped the meal would overpower the unfriendliness of the hosts. 

I got a strawberry margarita, which was sweet- but really good! You can upgrade it with an extra shot too for an additional fee. The drink was a bit overpriced, but they have a lot more affordable drink options to choose from. The Long Island iced tea is always $5!

My friend and I sat down, and the bread was amazinggg! The cinnamon butter never disappoints. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, so he definitely brightened our experience. 

I ordered the herb crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and a caesar salad. And I'll admit, I ALWAYS get this when I come here without fail- so I know how it's supposed to taste. I was looking forward to it. The mashed potatoes and the salad were great, but the herb crusted chicken was extremely too salty. To the point where I had to scrape off most of the seasoning to eat it. I was honestly too hungry to send it back though.

My friend ordered a sirloin steak- and he is a regular at Texas Roadhouse too. He ordered it medium well, but the steak came out extremely dry and VERY over cooked. 

The manager came over right away, which was great, and said he would get him a new steak. Our waiter then came over, and said ""Sorry about that! My manager is in the back making the steak for you himself!"" 

20 minutes pass by, and I've already finished my food, while my friend has only fries to pick at. We didn't see either our waiter, or a manager for that time. Then, we see the manager out near the bar, speaking to another customer. My friend and I were confused. How was the manager making our steak, if he's up here speaking with another customer?

Finally, we wave our server down, and let him know we never got the steak. He shot up immediately to tell the kitchen. So, they basically forgot to make our food.

They brought out the new steak finally, and it was cooked perfectly. The entire experience was just stressful and not very good- which we are not very used to going to other locations. It just seemed like they weren't prioritizing customers, and I was really missing the friendliness I usually receiving from the hosts at other Texas Roadhouse. I don't think I'll be going back to this location.",2021-03-12 18:35:58

Granted, I haven't been to all that many, but this place has the sort of fun ambiance and unique experience that you remember and want to return to again and again.

The restaurant is really out of the way, so you wouldn't be likely to drive past or even know it exists unless someone tells you...so I'm telling you now!  It's located on Eagle Creek Reservoir, the closest thing to a body of water in Indianapolis.  I'm told it's man made, but hrmph, details.  The outdoor patio is HUGE and extends over the water, with a big bar and tons of tables with great views of the water and boats, and if you go at dusk, a great view of the sunset.  We were there in time to see the sunset, but it was a bit too chilly and windy to sit outside (in August--shocking!), so we snagged a table inside right by the window, which was almost as great.  There was a live band playing some jazzy background music, and the atmopshere was just fabulous.  Festive, fun, but laid back all at once.

As for the food -- solid.  We had been doing a lot of eating the previous two days, so we chose lighter fare.  I would certainly return to try a seafood entree, they all sounded delish.  We started with cups of the seafood chowder, which was fantastic, but would have been better served sightly hotter.  Flavorful and lots of big hunks of fishy and potato-y goodness.  

For my main meal I had the summer goat cheese salad, which was mixed greens with prosciutto and strawberries (fantastic salty-sweet combo by the way) and two generous sized pistachio encrusted sauteed goat cheese  squares on top.  Dressed in balsamic vinagrette, it was the perfect light meal with hints of richness.  Nick had a wood-fired pizza (individual sized, but still -- large) with sausage and pepperoni.  I had a bite, and it was decent, but nothing to write home about.  Grandma had the cobb salad, which should have been called ""southwestern cobb"" or something because it was spicy!  I don't recall it saying that on the menu.  Good thing she likes spicy.  Nonetheless it was tasty, very fresh ingredients.

The menu is huge, and I'm afraid our selections did not do it justice.  We enjoyed our food very much, and I want to give it five stars, but I think I'd have to return.  Like I said, I'd return for a seafood entree or maybe a steak. It's a wee bit on the pricey side for Indy (more like Chicago prices), but I guess you're paying for the atmosphere.  I would certainly return, and if I were entertaining a guest in Indy, I would certainly bring them here.  Service was attentive but a little...strange.  At one point he called my grandmother ""my love.""  As in, ""yes, I'll get you a box for that salad, my love."" ????

Fantastic, unique dining experience in Indianapolis.  I'll be back to try the seafood.",2008-08-12 14:24:54

Yelp really needs to add zero stars for places like these. All the reviews about billing department are 100%  true. They don't know basic accounting and keep sending you multiple bills and collect payments months in advance. They never return calls or explain any charges as they are so disorganized and avoid any sort of accountability.  Everything turns into a confrontation with them and they do not make any effort to fix the problem.  Instead they to the extra mile to accuse the patients. This happened not only to me but other patients while I'm waiting for consults in their office. They don't care to cross verify anything including medical records. I haven't seen a penny of my money back from this place. The billing manager Jasmin is the rudest person you will encounter. I thought maybe this is just a standalone department issue within RMG but boy I was wrong. The doctors are part of this nightmare as much as the other staff. Your journey will be delayed by months due to this incompetent place.  They all like to make free money from you and not even do the bare minimum. There is no education about the process and you are just a sheep. Medical coordinators are a joke, you will be coordinating everything on your own. It's like pulling teeth to get any information from anyone.  They do not care about your timeliness and delay you by months for simple stuff in an industry where everything is highly time sensitive.  THEY NEVER ANSWER PHONES. The emotional trauma and damage done by this place is extremely heartbreaking and there is no $ value you can assign to it. Our doctor was Goodman and I don't think she honestly cared about providing a good treatment. We had no results with her and wasted more than a year with her. This place is what I call modern day robbery and I'm beyond appalled on how this place is running and robbing not only people's money but also hopes and dreams. I'm at a point where I want to sit outside this place and provide pamphlets to people to read yelp reviews before they enroll at this clinic as a public service.

I wish I read the yelp reviews over Google before I went to this place. People who run this and most of the staff should not be servicing anyone in medical industry based on my experience.",2021-11-10 03:36:15

We went for breakfast - they seated us in the open-air area with the stage and the full bar. AWESOME place to sit, especially on a beautiful morning (which it was). We ordered the Nashville beignets to start, because they instantly caught our eye, and those were pretty tasty (dipping sauce took them to another level). But this is where the problems kind of started. Our waiter was... chatty... too chatty... waaaaaaaay too chatty. When he dropped off the beignets, he stayed and talked our ear off about how he actually works at another restaurant at night that's a more high-dollar place, and how we should totally go check it out. Then he talked about the Predators (our local NHL team) and asked us about if we watched the game the other night - we hadn't - and giving us play-by-play of what happened. 

And he kept doing this. Every time he would come to the table (to fill up our coffee, to take empty plates, to ask how everything was and if we needed anything) he would stay a few minutes extra just to make awkward small talk.

We were very gracious and patient - and the guy was super friendly. But after the 3rd or 4th time, we were both starting to get annoyed. And it's a real shame, because the food wasn't bad at all! I ended up getting the chef's omelet of the day (with cheese, peppers and their brisket) which was fantastic, and my wife got the skillet hash - also terrific!

But the waiter just kind of brought the whole experience down a level. Look, I like friendly waiters and waitresses. I like when my waiter or waitress goes out of their way to talk to me, forge a connection. It can really elevate the experience and make it memorable. I'm an extrovert, so I thrive off of that stuff. But when I'm out with my wife and we're enjoying each other's company (cuz I happen to really, really enjoy talking to my wife and find her super interesting - crazy huh?) I don't appreciate having the waiter hanging out at our table and talking non-stop. That's not what we came for. 

I feel bad to give this place 3 stars - because I realize that he is just one waiter, and that the other waiters and waitresses are probably just fine and spend the normal amount of time at your table. But I can only give a rating based on the experience we've had. 

We would gladly give this place another shot! Just as long as we got a different waiter. Please.",2017-07-14 21:47:30

The restaurant seems to be very accommodating and friendly to large groups and that is a plus as well. 

And now on to the restaurant, which is why this review has only two stars. 
The food on the menu is subpar. The ""locally made"" pretzels are served cold, with cold queso dip. There was nothing delicious about it. With so many local restaurants making great pretzels in house, it doesn't make sense to have pretzels brought in if they don't even taste good, and aren't even sold hot. 
When ordering a burger the preferred temperature was not asked and arrived rather grey. 
I ordered the pot roast and I requested to leave off the peas and carrots. I was told by the waitperson that the peas and carrots came ""cooked in the gravy, mushrooms, and pot roast all together""
So I said that was fine. 
The dish arrived, and it was quite obvious that the vegetables were placed on the plate, THEN the mashed potatoes on top of them, THEN the pot roast and gravy. Additionally, the peas were cold and in water, and the carrots were raw. My fork would not pierce the carrots AT ALL. I did let my waitperson know that the vegetables were indeed separate from the gravy and pot roast, and that they were raw. She told me I was wrong, that the carrots and peas were cooked in the gravy and pot roast. She did ask me if I wanted to order something different, which didn't sound at all appetizing after my experience with the available food I had already tried. (I have also tried the sweet potato fries- high we're very dry and crunchy-in a bad way, and the fish and chips-the fish was dry, with an overcooked and oily batter)

At the end of the night, (after paying and leaving a 27% tip) I spoke with the waitperson again, and I told them that the vegetables were separate. They told me that was ""impossible because the food comes in a giant plastic bag from 'commissary' and it's all mixed up""

So the takeaway for me is that much of the food isn't made at the restaurant-resulting in subpar food, the wait staff isn't really sure how the food is prepared and gets defensive when asked about it, and too many of the menu items are just not good. 

I wanted to like this restaurant and gave it several chances. I'm not happy to leave negative reviews on restaurants. I do however, believe this is an accurate review.",2019-07-26 19:30:11

You have a really rude staff member by the name Andres that constantly makes jokes at members expensive same for that one girl with white clear rimmed glasses that works with him on Saturdays. I don't enjoy coming here due to the staff acting like teenagers and running amuk. Hey management please tell Andres to leave the members alone

UPDATE:
This Andres continued to be rude to where I finally asked who do you talk to in order to make a complaint about a employee. Guess who it is? It's Andres!
Palms up I say hey you've been very rude and disrespectful towards me please leave me alone moving forward.
He then grabs a card, then ask me to talk to him on the side.
I'm asking this person to leave me alone I didn't ask to interact. Just leave me alone you make me uncomfortable. A response of cool I'll leave you alone would be cool. But nope. Instead of handing me that card and telling me a name.
He pulls me to the side then says "" I have gotten calls from other managers about those complaints ( I have spoken with Whitney at the marketplace gym on 3 separate occasions over the months for different events this person has done towards me) I know about them"". I said ""if you know why continue on?"" He then asked me what he was doing. ""If you've received the complaints then your aware of what the complaints are. Just leave me alone, you've been rude you've gotten in my face before, you clap your hands around my head when you walk by, your just a rude person please leave me alone.""

Who puts there hand in another person's face and flicks at them when they're asking this person to leave them alone?

It's all on camera. Right in the black card lobby lounge. 5:47pm isshh today 9/14.

Now the bad. Noisy! Very Noisy. Even on the 21st floor there was traffic noise all night. We could hear our neighbors clearly and loudly. Another guest in the hotel said he had a hard time sleeping also because of the noise. Besides the thin walls and traffic, had to unplug the refrigerator which was inside a metal cabinet creating a noisy sound chamber, it sounded like a machine gun. Flushing toilets and showers from other guests created loud noises emanating from our bathroom.

Called housekeeping to see if they had a robe... they said they'd call back... never did.

I left clothes in a drawer after we checked out. Called the hotel and was told I needed to talk to security, transferred to security who said that he needed to transfer me to housekeeping and when he transferred me the phone disconnected. 15 minutes wasted on the phone.

Call the hotel back, put on hold for 5 minutes and when someone answered they told me they would forward me to security, than said to call back security wasn't available. Tired of the run-around, I told them to take my name, room number, and that I would stop by to pick up my clothes in a few hours.

When I got to the hotel, I was told I had to talk to security. Security wasn't available, I should wait. I waited 10 minutes and asked again, and I was told that Security is helping this gentleman who is in the lobby and So I waited with him for the security guy to show up. 20 minutes later Security shows and delivers boxes to the gentleman and then offers to take the boxes up to the gentleman's room. I ask if a bellman could do that, so security could help me. A bellman offers to bring the boxes up but security decides he's a bellman and says no.

Now I've been here 30 minutes with a car waiting to take me to a train I'm going to miss. I talk to the front desk and the manager tells me I have to wait. I ask her to send the stuff to my home and she tells me I'd have to pay for shipping? Seriously? After all this wasted time? After all this frustration? Than the manager walks off.

After 40 minutes I get my clothes. Why is there only 1 busy person in a hotel who can help a former customer? Marriott, Hilton, Hyatts.... real hotel management companies know how to manage the customer experience. The don't have a single point of failure.

Her service was fantastic, she had a great personality. I would consider giving Prime another chance just because of her. 

We went to Prime 47 for Devour. I always try to choose the more expensive restaurants to try out for the first time during devour. I had very high hopes for Prime. And due to their high prices and high expectations I'm a little more critical with this review. I started my course with clam chowder soup, it was pretty good, very chunky with a lot of clam meat, I enjoyed it, but I've still had way better for way cheaper. Next was the main course - I chose the Orange Marinated Charred Filet Mignon and my friend got the Herb Crusted Airline Chicken Breast. My 6 oz. medium rare filet came out split in half (kinda butterflied). I was not happy with that, I felt like that ruined it to start with. The presentation was horrible, just a glob of this blue cheese & onion mix thrown on top. It  was wayyyy too much (sorry I don't have a picture, it was too dark where we were seated). I immediately scraped it off to try the steak without it. I also tried the steak with it. I wasn't impressed either way. I'm not sure where the orange was supposed to come in... I had zero orange taste. It also didn't help that my steak was cold. It takes a lot for me to add salt and pepper to any dish, I'm a firm believer that you should trust the chef. But I added salt & pepper. I'm not one to typically complain or send back food, but with a $40 steak I decided to speak up when our server asked how it was. She was very kinda about it and got me the salmon instead. The salmon was definitely much better, but I still don't think it lived up to my expectations. I also tried my friend's chicken and again, I was not impressed. It had good enough flavor but was way to chewy, not juicy at all. 

The desserts were the best course of the night. We tried the chocolate cake and the cheesecake. Both were delicious. 

I know my review seems harsh, but if you look through my past reviews you will see a lot of 5 stars, it takes a lot for me to give 3 or less. But I feel like for the price of this restaurant I expect as close to perfection as it gets. Unfortunately, I feel like there are much cheaper and way tastier options close by. The atmosphere inside Prime was very lovely. I loved the live piano player, she did an amazing job.

I've gotten more so into cooking since I've become vegan so I find myself looking for the best vegan restaurants and critiquing them like I'm Gordon Ramsey or something.

I started my meal with the bulletproof, which is espresso blended with coconut oil. Personally, I don't have much experience with coconut oil as I don't purchase it because of it's high price, and because there are alternatives. However, I loved this coffee but I felt compelled to get the macadamia milk and maple syrup for some reason which just ruined it. I ended up spending $6.50 on the drink which I ruined after two sips. Lesson learned!

One thing about me is that I find it extremely difficult to choose what I want to eat when the menu has so many options and a benefit to becoming vegetarian (and later on vegan) was that it made choices much easier when eating at different establishments with few vegetarian/vegan options. A year ago my girlfriend also went vegan and as such we eat out almost only at vegan restaurants. Thankfully she has an eye for what she wants and so I leaned on her for help.

Since our last few visits to the US she discovered real Mexican food and just fell in love, but since then nothing has come close to the taste that she experienced down there. It's become harder to find that taste even among most Mexican vegan food. I figured, however, to give the enchiladas a try so that she can also experience it also while she ordered the tofu scramble. 

Safe to say if it's not Mexican people making it then it's not going to taste very Mexican either. (The jury is still out on whether Mexicans can make good Mexican vegan.) My enchilada went cold super fast, my bread was way too thick and the contents didn't really have much flavour. I could say I was very disappointed but I'm not super picky. I was full with what I had eaten, although I must say I couldn't get enough of the salad. It was super simple with just a seasoning of salt and pepper but it did the trick.

With regards to my partners breakfast (tofu scramble with a side of hollandaise) the hollandaise took a couple of tastes but it grew on us. The bowl itself was just okay; there was really nothing special about it. The rice was a surprise, buried under everything else, so it made the dish seem bipolar. The first part was mainly a tofu dish and the second half was a rice dish. The vegan sausage was sliced and scarce in the dish so you couldn't really get a taste for it. Would she recommend it? No.

To compliment our breakfast we ordered a side of spicy potato hash which, overall, was probably the best dish. The corn was a nice addition to the hash but the skins of the kernels would wedge themselves between our teeth.

The overall experience was as good as any other place we've been to in the city. The cafe is gorgeous, being so open and airy, and I would surely come back for a coffee and dessert to see what the experience is like later in the day. However, I wouldn't necessarily say this place is better or worse than any other vegan spots in Edmonton.

By the end I was full, so was my girlfriend. I hope more vegan spots come to Edmonton as the benefits of veganism continue to become more prominent in the mainstream of Canadian food habits. This will surely push restaurants to focus more on the food which is ultimately what I'm looking at. Stop by Moth on a sunny day; you'll be glad you did.",2019-01-27 23:51:53

I was trying to steer my parents toward ordering through one of the showrooms we had visited because the owner, Max, was shady & surly when we were considering buying the granite there.  Unfortunately, Elegant Tile won out on the cabinets because they were the only ones who guaranteed they would meet our deadline.  I knew I was in trouble when they ordered the cabinets based on my dad's drawing & measurements(?!?!). That's right- they didn't send someone out to measure before placing the order.

Chris is an excellent salesman.  He'll talk your ear off & promise you everything will be handled, and you should trust him because he's been a cabinet maker for years.  But once this company has your money, you're in for a ride.   The day they were supposed to install, I waited around and no one showed up.  Chris kept saying, ""Don't worry! I PROMISE you I'll have someone out by the end of the day.""  Around 1 pm I he called to tell me he would have someone out the following day.  At 9 AM he told me his guy was on the way.  When no one showed up by 11, I called him.  He claimed that he had no idea what had happened but, ""I PROMISE I'll have someone out by the end of the day.""  At that point it dawned on me that if I relied on them, the job wouldn't get done.  I called the granite fabricator in tears (Sanchez Granite- they're awesome!) and she went way above the call of duty to make a few phone calls and found me an excellent cabinet installer.   When I told Chris I had found an installer, he told me it would cost the installer $200 to deliver the cabinets.  Seriously?

When it came time to have the cabinets delivered, they had the nerve to tell the installer that they'd have to charge him $600 (hiked up from $200 the evening before) to rent their truck to deliver the cabinets.  After I demanded they deliver the cabinets themselves to make up for their mess, Paymon (Max's son) finally showed up.  Paymon let me know on arrival that delivering cabinets wasn't his ""job"", then proceeded to tear into me about how they did everything right and how I had no right to be upset or angry.  Let me be clear: to make up for lost time, I had no choice but to do the tear out/demolition on my parents' kitchen MYSELF so it didn't throw off the schedule for the granite fabricators, who I had lined up well in advance.  AND I had to find my own cabinet installer.  But according to them, I had no right to be upset.

The icing on the cake was when we opened up the boxes and found that the cabinets were not the color, style, or even size we had ordered!   The installer kindly offered to custom build the pantry cabinets to compensate for Elegant Tile's colossal error.  When I called Elegant Tile, Chris said he couldn't do anything about any of it.  In lieu of an apology, Chris blamed Max, the installers, and the cabinet manufacturers.  And then told me not to call back.  Customer service & accountability are clearly not a part of their vocabulary.

Take your money to a company who will do the job right, keep their word, will actually deliver what you ordered, and who values your business.

*******
Update: I received an apology via email after posting this review.  It came in the form of (and, I quote):
-""The installers that did not show up were beyond our control""
- that the hideous cabinets we didn't order ""would have been a 30% upgrade cost""
- ""The delivery cost we also are covering, approx. $2200"".
(funny how the number went from $200 to $600 to $2200). At $2200, I guess they were sending the cabinets over in an armored car with hired private guards. Mind you, it's a 15 minute drive between their ""business"" and my parents' home.  They must be high.

The meal was festive because the occasion was happy and the company was sparkling.

However, Yelp does not review the wonderful people I had dinner with 

Nor can it promise you the good times that we had to celebrate.

So how does Vista Peru work for you the Yelp reader,

If you just have to go there for the food with whatever company you got?

* * *

Vista Peruvian tries too hard to go upscale.

They are good on exotic ingredients.

You can get grilled beef heart for an appetizer (thumbs up)

and purple corn pudding for dinner.

(I now know why purple corn never caught on.

Imagine corn starch fell in love with prune jelly.)

The seafood dishes make heavy use of lobster.

It gets the price of the dish up.

It may look dramatic in the plate

But it is a pain in the patooties to eat.

Pull a lobster chunk out of boiling soup with your hands.

Hold the blazing hot shell with your bare fingers while you try to crack it with the nutcracker. 

The stock makes the shell nice and slippery so your nutcracker will not succeed at doing what you want it to do.

However, at some point after several tries, holding the hot shell, you will pull out some shreds of lobster.

That lobster has been in boiling soup forever looking pretty

So the lobster taste has leeched out long ago.

You try to convince yourself, ""Hey I'm eating lobster. This must be an upscale treat.""

You then stick your fingers back into the boiling stock for a another frustrating struggle. After another battle, and more burning fingers, a few more strands of boiled-to-death lobster.

Your hands will not thank you.

* * *

Ceviche is not a thrill either.

Even the mild ceviche is spicy and fights with you. 

The spice kills much of the taste of the shellfish.

This may be authentic but it is not fun.

The other shellfish is more accessible and tastier.

Squid octopus and shrimp are not bad.

They have more exotic potatoes than most American restaurants do.

They are interesting but they do not make an overwhelming case for the superiority of Peru's unique potato heritage.

* * *
I have had way more fun in Peruvian places in Texas and California and paid a third of the price.

But grilled beef heart reminds me that life is still worth living.

And you can always comfort yourself with a pisco sour.

Who have just done something wonderful.

I want the French toast right now!

Other than that, my room was gorgeous. Very very comfortable. The attendants for the room were extremely gracious and nice. Always on time and literally whatever you needed, they were at your service.

Yep, to those who are not in the know, Guadalajara Grill was at another location literally just down the street.  Of course, the need to change venues was due in no large part to the serious overcrowding of the place.  I thought the old place was cozy, especially the bar area and patio.  

As mentioned by every single other review, the tableside salsa is great.  Like your salsa super spicy with extra cilantro, the lady will make it for you.  Like your salsa as mild as Jay Leno's humor, the lady will be happy to comply.  You the get the idea.  

The food was, and still is, on the average to slightly above average range.  My personal favorite in the area of Mexican cuisine is mole, and Guadalajara Grill does a decent job.  One positive thing is that the place does not mess around with the drinks, especially the margaritas.  

 I went to the old location many times since its inception.  I even recall the German restaurant that came before it.  Since it moved into its new digs, however, I have only been there twice.  On my last visit, the place was jam packed; not just with any normal human beings, mind you, but with Greek-loads of sorority girls and fraternity boys.  

I normally have the patience of Job, but on this last trip, the service was appallingly slow.  I would have enjoyed a hazing from the surrounding tables just to pass the time.  In all fairness, however, the place was packed to capacity, and my party had over 10 people.  Still you'd think that a larger operation would mean a larger kitchen and additional staff.  Mmm hmmm....

My first experience at the new location was special.  Well, it was special for purely external reasons: it was my birthday.  The wait time for a party of 12 on a Friday night?  An hour and a half at least.  No skin of my back because I'm not above drinking at the bar.  Yeah, the bar experience sucked.  Sucked the life out me, that is.  It took freakin' forever for the bartenders to even acknowledge our existence.  While the fellows behind the bar were not of the surly sort, they certainly did not seem to understand the concept of tipping.  

After a while the staff approached one my friends and explained to her that there were a couple of tables available within the bar area, and she took it.  Remember that I was still at the bar having a near odyssey experience securing a drink, so I see my entire party beginning to squeeze into the back corner of the area of the bar.   In hindsight, it wasn't all that bad.  It literally brought us together.  Who knew that two booths normally meant for a total of eight people could accommodate 12 adults and one child?

I have now been to this beautiful and elegant restaurant two times and have grown to love it already. I celebrated my 30th birthday here with dinner with a few friends. There are many things I want to point out as to why this is an excellent choice for both a celebratory dinner as well as getting together with a friend to chat over some exquisite cuisine. To begin, the free valet service offered is a wonderful thing (of course tipping is a generous thought to have). You pull up to the front door of the restaurant to be given a friendly greeting before they valet your car for you. Also, the temperature inside is ideal. I wore a dress with no sleeves and I was very comfortable. I brought an extra cardigan and didn't even need it, and I am someone who is always cold. The menu is not small by any means, which is usually the case for higher end restaurants. There are numerous specials every time you go in. I'm talking so many you might have to ask your server to repeat them! The seafood here is as fresh as it gets. They even offer whole fish that can be filleted right at the table. The appetizers are absolutely scrumptious. I highly recommend the Maine lobster and asparagus salad - amazing!!! I ordered the flounder special and it was outstanding. My friends all loved their meals as well. The dessert menu is decent and the prices are actually not bad! However, expect to spend a pretty penny here by the end, but it's worth it for all of the delicious food! You can absolutely come here and order just one meal each to help cut down the bill, but trust me - you'll want to order more! During dinner time on the weekends, a wonderful Italian man walks around playing Italian music on the accordion. It really tops off the night and sets the mood. I have attached a photo from a video of this happening next to me at my dinner. What a nice man he was as well as he finished his solo by telling us he hopes we enjoy our meals and the rest of our night. Also, for birthdays they serve your dessert with a large sparkler (see photos). Exquisite! Additionally, the atmosphere here is absolutely breathtaking. The lighting is romantic and there is also lighted decor. The outdoor section is super cute, but the inside is elegant. There are so many rooms here, they can accommodate many guests! I feel this would help with fitting in those last minute reservations. The servers here are also very polite and take care of you very well during the meal (wipe away crumbs and provide new napkins anytime you get up from your seat to use the restroom). All in all, this is my new go to restaurant for special occasions (or just to meet a friend for dinner). I highly recommend you add this beautiful and elegant restaurant to your list of places to try. You won't regret it!",2021-10-05 15:21:46

What finally pulled me there?  The Taste of the Comstock - a day to 'sample savory bites of Virginia City's finest fare'.  I thought this would be a perfect opportunity for a first-timer like me to get a 'taste' of the city, no pun intended.
Thanks to Yelp, we had access to the VIP lounge where guests could sample a nice variety of whiskies as well as cigars and bar snacks.  After a couple of brave sips, off we went to check out the town and the 17 businesses that participated in this event.
First impression:  I couldn't believe how vibrant the main drag was!  I mean, i lost count of how many businesses were there.  And so many people!  It felt festive, which I liked, as it instantly lifted my mood.  
Most of the participating business were in the main street.  The farthest was the Gold Hill Hotel, which happened to also served the best sample of the day (beef brisket, yum!). Much as we wanted to walk there, we were strongly advised to take the shuttle (free), mainly to save time.    
There was a good variety of food and drink samples offered by the participating businesses.  Among the samples were quesadillas, soup, small dessert plates, gelato, coffee, fudge, bruschetta, sandwiches, popcorn, popcorn, jerky, beers, shooters, cocktails, and even coffee.  The quality of the food was not that great for me, but at least they participated.  Most of the people from the businesses we went to were very friendly.  I did get the sense that everyone knows everyone here.  I also noticed that a lot of people dressed as people did in the Comstock days (I imagine).  There were demos and shows and tours happening everywhere.  It was busy!  And I enjoyed every minute of it.
We were able visit all 17 businesses in 3 hours.  We probably could have done it faster, but we were browsing through the stores.  Hubby is an antique nut, so he was having a great time.  I mostly enjoyed the atmosphere and the character of each store.  Much as VC tries to preserve the past, I also noticed that it has become a tourist trap.  I wondered what it would feel like when the tourists are gone, and only the locals are left.  Would the atmosphere be different?  I would love to find out, but I heard there are ghosts here, so I think I'll pass.
Overall, a very enjoyable experience.  The highlight?  The Tardis parked on the side of the road!  I will be back to check out the other events happening in VC, but mostly to check if the Tardis is still there.",2016-06-14 21:18:05
fKCCwh1FzjuFAVqp1kBeSQ,BBdRlIK_eeFhdl4EL1pLAw,kbAvGWufNK6sgub3EdiKhA,4.0,5,0,0,"When my travel plans take me to Reno, I normally stay at the Tuscany Suites inside the Peppermill Resort & Casino, but not on this trip.

The wife and I went up to spend time with my buddy and his family who live on the south end of Reno (in the S. Meadows area) and since me and my buddy we're going to be celebrating our belated birthdays with some adult beverages, I wanted to stay at a hotel close to their place.

I did some checking and yelping a few days before the drive up and found out this Hampton Inn had recently opened and was only about a mile away from my buddies place.  

We arrived on July 30, 2010 around 5:30 pm.  Check-in was a breeze and we we're handed keys to room #415.  Top floor and next to the elevator, just as I like and requested.

Entering the room, nothing extraordinary jumped out at me, but I did take notice that the rooms include a mid-size refrigerator and a microwave.  I wish I would have known that prior to my arrival.  Long story short, I stopped by my buddies place before the hotel to drop of some food and adult beverages thinking I didn't have a fridge to put the stuff in.

Pros of the hotel are:
1.  Breakfast in the AM.
2.  Indoor pool / jacuzzi
3.  Laundry room.
4.  Coffee available 24/7.
5.  Decent gym.
6.  Free and up close parking.
7.  Quiet and scenic area around the hotel.
8.  Great prices.
9.  Fridge & Microwave inside each room.
10.  And the best of all, It's a SMOKE FREE hotel.

Cons:
1.  No gaming machines inside the place.
2.  Walls are pretty thin (I could hear the maids in the next door bathroom talking plain as day).
3.  Nothing within walking distance to eat.  You need a car if you wanna get around.

If your in the Reno area and want a place to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the downtown area, here's your place.

**  Here's some in & outs for you future visitors.  **

The hotel sits between S. Meadows and Double Diamond Blvd's.  If you drive North on Double R from the hotel and make a right onto S. Meadows Blvd., there's a bunch of places to eat and about 3 banks including Wells Fargo.  There's also a Smith's grocery (http://www.yelp.com/biz/smiths-food-and-drug-centers-reno#hrid:bc8bxWuJ3McdiHrsh6711Q/src:self) store with some really good prices.  Make sure you tell them your from out of town when you purchase anything.  Now, if you make a left turn onto S. Meadows from  Double R when you leave the hotel, you'll run into the Winco and S. Virginia St. just past the 395 freeway.

Leaving out towards the South from the hotel and making a right onto Double R, you'll dead end at  Double Diamond.  If you make a right turn and drive just under the 395, you'll find the Wal-Mart, a Del Taco, a Round Table Pizza and a bunch of other fast food places inside the strip mall.  

If you have an itch that can only be scratched by gambling, you need to make a left turn onto S. Virginia St. from Double Diamond Blvd. and you'll run into the Tamarack Casino (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tamarack-junction-casino-reno).  It's a locals hang out with a decent sports bar and lots of slots.  Sorry, but no table games.",2010-08-04 05:28:44

We decided to venture out a little bit (it's really not that far). When we got to the parking lot it was almost 8am, and I saw only one car parked in the parking lot. Either the place was closed or everyone was at the Bread Co. It was freezing, so instead of getting out of the car only to be met with a locked door, I decided to call. Matt answered and said that they were indeed open! Score!

The place was empty, so we were free to explore the café, reading all of the signs they had on the windows showcasing their baking area. There quite a few selection of sandwiches, bagels, and sweets. I ordered the New Yawker and my wife had the OOH LA LA! My bagel was fresh and very tasty. I especially appreciated the capers that were in the bagel. I've never had capers with a bagel before, but it was a great addition to the smoke salmon and cream cheese. I had a couple bites of my wife's sandwich, and I definitely appreciate how fluffy the eggs were, but I still preferred my sandwich. We ended breakfast with an Almond croissant, which was probably my favorite part of the meal. The croissant was covered in sliced almonds, and the almond filling...yummm.....I'm drooling just thinking about it right now. This was more food than we probably should've ate, but it was worth it.

Fast forward 4 hours later, and we are back! We were talking to our friends about this place, and they wanted to try it out for lunch. I normally don't like going to a place twice in one day, but I really enjoyed my breakfast earlier that day and wanted to hang out with my friends. This time I split a sack lunch with my wife. We had the FA LA LA LA LA sandwich with a side salad and a gooey butter cake bite. I would say I enjoyed the gooey butter cake the most, followed by the sandwich and then the salad. This gooey butter cake was probably one of the best I've had in the St. Louis area. My original favorite gooey butter cake is from Park Ave., but this one gives Park Ave a run for its money. My wife ended ordering another piece of the gooey butter cake, but instead of just getting a gooey butter cake bite, she got a bar. The bar felt like it weighed a pound. So dense, so delicious!

A feel like this is a little hidden gem in the area. Check it out as an alternative to Bread Co.",2017-01-09 17:59:48
WhJA87hsw_Rv7_1b35d6KQ,ZUjtrujFUynsLY7lHc2zow,jmwasbZfgj3honf79qKsnA,3.0,2,0,1,"Ok, but mostly a Chipotle wanna-be.

I have been to this place several times and each time has been disappointing for either myself or my friends, hence the 3-stars.

Food
Since Chipotle popularized this modern genre (fast, fresh, tacos and burritos) I will use it merely as a common benchmark to relate my opinions to.  By that familar comparison, if we award Chipotle an A- then Street Taco gets a C+.  Their meat selections are very similar to Chipotle (with shredded or chopped beef; pork and chicken) and are very similar in terms of (good/fresh-grilled) taste.  There are some significant short-comings however:

The entrees (again, almost identical in terms of menu presentation) contain about 25% less meat than Chipotle, and all come at about a 15-20% price-premium.  This is also true for the overall size of the burritos and the ""fixins"" options (not as much beans, rice, etc are served up).  So the overall burrito is distinctly smaller than at Chiptole... easily 25% smaller.  In addition to tacos and burritos, they have sandwhiches which are made from the same meat options.  Avoid these!  They are a mess to eat, contain even fewer quantities of meat/condiments, and cost about the same.

Another shortcoming is that all of the ingredients are hidden from the customer by ""buffet"" style rolling lids which are flipped up/back and shield the customer's view from menu options.  One result was that a friend (first-timer) had no idea what was available (and the server never indicated what options their were) so his burrito was extra small, Lol.  Even after having gone back several times, I certainly did not have everything memorized and it was annoying to ask what else was behind the lids (even the plexiglass sneeze-guards didn't have labels on them).

Drinks are fountain-style and there are a variety, from sodas to ice-teas, that one can serve themselves from.  Chips and salsas are also readily self-servable.

Seating
There is very limited seating and almost all of it consists of mostly 2-tops, with a handful of 4-tops.  If you are a bigger group, you will be flat out of luck.  The venue is also small/cramped/noisy, so during the lunch crush you should always be prepared to take things to-go in the likely event that no tables are open.

Parking
This is located in the heart of downtown, so it's ideal for local/office-workers but otherwise parking is a nightmare.

Conclusion
When I am downtown and I'm hankering for a Chipotle-like experience, I will still come here, but I will try to avoid 12n-1p AND I have to be resigned to eating a smaller portion for a bit more money too.",2015-05-18 18:09:31
2P9Vejf0zbwRkvh4CYgLJA,1Cay4Q1WBUrNhrp4lb96oA,8pqdJjefYq-a9IBSJJmKwA,5.0,1,1,0,"Damn it Dandelion... Now I have to go back to all my other 5 star reviews, and reduce them to 4 stars, because your restaurant has completely changed my standards when it comes to restaurant quality. 

The Setting: Went to OpenTable to reserve 24 hours in advance, had only a few seating times, secured a 5pm table for two.  Arrived at 5 to find the loveliest, ivy-covered, historic building on the corner of 18th and This Can't Be Philly.  Was immediately seated upstairs in their dog-themed room, which houses one of their multiple full bars.  Ate beneath the watchful eyes of approximately 180 framed paintings of English hunting dogs, and watched the bartender pour drinks by the light of three streetlamp bulbs which together read ""Man's Best Friend"", behind a  metal rod featuring gold bulldog heads.  Intimate dim lighting from several massive, rustic barrel-hoop chandeliers capped off the oddly over-the-top yet classy atmosphere.

The Food: Start with the 'British Cheese Board'.  Trust me.  Particularly enjoy the Stilton blue cheese & honey on some sort of heavenly melt-in-your-mouth sweet cracker.  And the sharp white cheddar with savory grape chutney.  Vegetable/Salad-inclined?  The 'Baby Gem Lettuce Caesar Salad' is a treasure.  3 rather huge lettuce hearts, real anchovies, pickled onions, surprisingly well-paired Dill pickle slices, and tiny pumpernickel crostini on the side with little dollops of their peppery parmesan caesar dressing atop. 'Rabbit Pie' entree was good, 'Scottish Salmon' entree was a bit under-cooked for my liking (I prefer the flesh completely opaque, no translucent pink interior), but the onion puree was good enough to mask all shortcomings. 

The Desserts: 'Sticky Toffee Pudding' with rum butter pecan ice cream is a good bet.  'Eton Mess Macaron' was an adorable sweet treat: 2 macaron cookies each filled with both a chunky honey pear fruit sauce and devon cream, then drizzled in honey. And between the two, a tiny cup of refreshing Riesling White Wine-Pear sorbet.

The Staff: Ask them anything.  ""What is this cheese again. Where is it from?""  They'll fire off the answer in record time.  Tell your server a type of liquor you like, he'll suggest the perfect premium cocktail, including ones not on the menu.  You will especially luck out in this regard if you're seated in the section of a waiter named Connor.  Pace-wise, each course came out rapidly, even on a crowded Saturday night 4 days before Christmas.

The Drinks: 'The Iron Lady' is a twist on the Old Fashioned for whiskey fans, and a rare instance where the new version is even better than the classic.  The 'Pimm's Deluxe' is a gin-lover's dream. Take a big bite out of the cucumber garnish before you order a second.  But first prize goes to the 'Scotch Honeysuckle', which gives only subtle hints of its scotch foundation, smells of soothing spa-like rosewater, and tastes of sweet honey.

tl;dr:  The real shining stars are the cocktails, appetizers, and desserts.  Skip the entrees, spend copious amounts of money on the rest, and enjoy the ambiance.",2013-12-22 02:58:18

They also attacked my honest google review replying with a defensive response instead of apologizing for their downfalls that caused a dissatisfied customer and lost sale.  They were blaming me for changing my initial mind on product, they falsely claimed I ""balked"" on first estimate because I asked for further quotes on different products to figure out what options would work for us.  I thought initial consult and quotes were to see what works for the client, sounds like they don't prefer you changing your mind.  Wish I had better experience like other reviews.  Read my experience below. 

I called for a consult d/t receiving mailer and was not sure what shades I would want, but had interest in roman shades as we have some current cellular shades.  We made appt 9/9/20, I told them I would not be there but my partner/co-owner would be home. Unfortunately, he missed the appt as he had a work meeting and forgot.  We both called them and apologized that day, they seemed happy to reschedule appt consult for 9/11.  My partner was there for consult, I was not as I had to work as expected.  My partner felt Andy was not knowledgeable about shades as he insisted we have Hunter Douglas cellular shades and we do not have them.  HD places there name on their shades and there is not one sign of HD label on any of the current shades we have and we have since confirmed with another dealer that they are not HD blinds.  We went to a Saturday showroom appt 9/19 in order to view other products & fabrics to decide what we wanted.  Salesman, Andy, kept saying he was not sure about how all the shades work and he has no clue how motorized shades work, deterring us on motorized option.  We received estimate on 9/21 for HD shades which are pricey, therefore, I simply wanted to consider the price difference for all Graber cellular shades compared to Hunter Douglas, as Andy told us the difference would only be 5% and it turned out it was 50% difference.  I reached back out to Andy via email to quote all windows for Graber cellular shades.  I did not have swatches for Graber to choose, so I order samples from Graber myself.  I asked Andy a few times in emails to give an estimate for Graber without finalizing my fabric choice, he never responded with that quote.  He only sent pictures of Graber color fabrics.  Last email with Andy, he still had not given me a Graber quote.  I felt like they did not care or want my business as Andy did not stay on top of my interest in quotes in order to compare for what we wanted to solidify a plan, as this is a big up front purchase for homeowner.",2020-10-07 18:52:46
6vgdk4rKVQdaDnpKBHvCjg,1HM81n6n4iPIFU5d2Lokhw,9xdXS7jtWjCVzL4_oPGv9A,3.0,6,3,3,"I've been attempting to eat here for years but every time I've scheduled a meal here something always seemed to get in the way.  Well I was finally able to break my GW Fins curse last night.  This place always seems to be crowded and mostly with tourists and that was the case during my meal.  The interior of this place is very modern and ""hip"" and personally that's not my style so I didn't find that aspect very appealing.  It also gets pretty loud in here due to the crowd so that should also be a consideration when planning to eat here.  The food here is generally not New Orleans style food but they have a few New Orleans dishes splashed about the menu. 

I ate here with one of my friends and we shared the fried lobster tail appetizer which tasted ok and exactly what I thought fried lobster would taste like.  I had the hog snapper for my entree and apple pie for dessert while my friend had the wood grilled grouper and molten chocolate cake.  The hog snapper was highly recommended by our server and it came with a very crispy sear/crust on one side that I didn't really like but the rest of the fish was cooked well other than being VERY bland and it  lacked seasoning so I had to resort to some Tabasco sauce.  Where this dish really fell flat was in the ""sides"" which were lobster and tomato risotto, sugar snap peas, and lobster butter.  The fish was stacked on top of a hint of about a tablespoon of  flavorless risotto and I was served exactly THREE snap peas.  In my book these don't count as sides but garnishes!  Vegetables are cheap and for the prices they charge you should certainly be served more than three peas (I love peas!) and a tablespoon of risotto.  My friend found the grouper dish to be very nice and that fish tasted much better to me while still needing a bit more spice.  I had no chance to sample the molten chocolate cake as my friend gulped it down and my apple pie was satisfactory but I've certainly had better.  

If you're looking for a New Orleans type experience this is definitely not the place for either NOLA ambiance or food.  If you're looking for something very different and in the mood for seafood this is a good option for something much different than you will find anywhere else in the area.  They seem very concerned with artistic plating but that comes at the expense of stacking things on top of each other and I hate my food being stacked like that and it also results in them giving you very small portions of the accompanying sides.  I prefer function over form with my plate and the plating here definitely makes form the main focus with the result that eating requires unstacking the pile that has been served to you.  This is also a very tourist filled spot and very expensive for the portion sizes.  At these prices there are many other restaurants I like a lot more.  Overall this isn't a place I would frequent but it is on my list for an occasional change of pace.  They certainly have a very nice and constantly changing selection of seafood on the menu that you won't find in most other local spots.  If they would kick up the spice, serve decent portions of sides, and STOP the practice of stacking food on plates I would like this place a great deal more.",2012-09-20 13:51:44

To that, I respond in the most american way I possibly could. By taking my German car , which put me in massive debt, and going out to Chester County to terrorize the blue bloods by driving at breakneck speeds in an effort to use as much fossil fuel as humanly possible in the span of a couple hours. And on that front, I will say mission accomplished. We were greeted at one point by Chester County's finest, who stated they received no less than 5 complaints regarding our little excursion into the backroads. Luckily, they were completely cool and let us off with nothing more than a warning and that we may want to move onto Delaware County if we wanted to continue our shenanigans. 

Now, what does this have to do with pizza? Well, if you've ever spent a good amount of time in the cockpit of a high performance car then you know that eventhough it's a fun time, it gets hot and will take a toll on your body. Therefore, as you are draining the fuel from your gastank, you need to refuel your body. Knowing little to nothing about the restauants in the snob filled Main Line we left the restauant picking to a friend who set up our little rally. His choice was Anthony's. 

Luckily since it was a holiday, it was fairly empty so we had no problems getting seating for our group of 7. The menu is pretty small which was nice for a change since so many pizza shops in the area seem to want to offer you everything from Pizza, to 20 different types of pasta dishes, 30 sandwich combinations, appetizers, etc. etc. Never understood that. You are a pizza place, just focus on the pizza and leave the other stuff to other places. Anthony's seems to fit the mold of a place with a small menu and they focus on making the items on the limited menu as well as possible. 

I split a small pizza with the better half and as a tip, if it's just two of you, it is more than enough. The pizza's, as has been stated in just abuot every review, are thin crusted and usually burnt. Now, normally that would be a bad thing. However, I have to say that it actually works. It's burnt, but I didn't find that it took away from the flavor at all. We ordered a pizza with sausage, meatballs, ricotta cheese and peppers on top. I thought everything went well together. The sausage and peppers providing just the right amount of bite and the ricotta and meatballs balancing out the spicyness with a some sweetness. It was just what we needed after our 3 hour journey. I'm not saying this is the greatest pizza ever, and it's certainly not the cheapest, but it was a nice change of pace from the normal shops in the area. I'd definitely stop by again if I'm in the area. 

P.S. No animals were harmed during our trip. Not that it matters....",2011-07-05 12:05:14

We were stranded in a dead part of town and I was starving and in need of a place with gluten free offerings and this place popped up on my handy Yelp app and was only a few blocks away from the convention center. 

I went in expecting salads and GF pizza, the usual GF offerings, but there were SO many more options! Gluten free flatbreads, chicken tenders (breaded with corn), and a host of unique salads and of course, a ton of pizza options. You could create your own pizza or choose from their originals.

We had dinner here twice and lunch once during our 1.5 day stay... and during the time I had a couple of personal pizzas, salads, and dessert. Where to begin: the pizza was SO good. The crust was chewy, yet crispy on the edges and more like a pan-pizza, something that is RARE with GF pizza. SO good.  The pepperoni is nitrate free and tasty and the mozzarella cheese and sauce was perfect. Tons of fresh and unique toppings to choose from and EVERYTHING nutritionally/allergy-wise is clearly spelled out on the menu. Staff is really knowledgeable too.

The Pear & Gorgonzola Salad is really refreshing with Arugula, romaine, pear, gorgonzola and candied walnuts. Best part: all of their salad dressings are gluten free! 

Just when I thought this place couldn't get better, our super sweet server let me know that they had a gluten free brownie for dessert and it was out of this world. 

Don't need to eat a gluten free meal? My husband who has no dietary restrictions loved his pizzas & a wrap he had too.  Have other dietary restrictions? There are also TONS of vegan and vegetarian options too and most of their menu is organic. 

Other miscellaneous awesome: Super clean and modern space, including the bathroom; cute outdoor eating area; great lunch special of personal pizza and small salad for $5.99; and a ton of beer and even sangria available. Even the music was awesome - think of your favorite bands from the late 90's, 2000's, my husband I were transported to our high school/college days.

I can't thank the super-friendly & sweet staff here who sympathized with us being stranded & even gave us some good ideas on what to do in Tampa on a slow Monday night. This place made being stranded in Tampa (with a food allergy nonetheless) not only bearable but super pleasant. Please open up a franchise in Chicago!",2014-04-08 21:33:34

I wanted to speak to the manager or Owner about inviting them down to a local radio show and then speaking to them about purchasing a large order for a dinner I was helping put together. When Kathy answered the telephone, I asked her for the manager or the owner. She then promptly tells me ""We don't do solicitation calls"" and hung up on me before I could even explain to her why I was calling. I called back and informed her that it was extremely rude to hang up on someone. I told her the purpose of my call and she then begins to tell me how she is not interested, She of course did not even allow me to get to the part that I wanted to purchase anything from her. She does not bother to apologize for her callous behavior, I then lost the call while she was speaking. I decided to wait several hours to cool off before calling back to speak to the owner. I had no idea that the owner was the same rude woman I had spoken to earlier. I kept trying to explain to her that it was very rude to be so disrespectful to someone. She then accuses me of hanging up earlier and now harassing her. This infuriated me even more, I kept trying to explain to her what the issue was and why I was upset with there customer service. I told her I lost the call earlier and didn't call back because I was upset, she proceeds to tell me I am a liar and that I hung up on her and now were even. This is not the behavior that I would expect from a so called business professional. I would never call them again or even stop by to give them business. I am shocked that they are still open by having such terrible customer service. After reading through the reviews I can see that several other people have had the same issue. She tried to use the excuse that her husband was in his late 70's and that she had just had knee surgery, I am sorry but that is not an excuse to be rude and hang up on people. I could have brought them several hundred dollars worth of business with what I was doing. I would never recommend this bakery ever!",2013-04-15 03:08:17

I got robbed.  My online reservation for a Chrysler 200 for 7 days was $161.  The friendly guy behind the desk (30, white, short dark hair, supposedly had been there for a decade according to the other person behind the counter, Saturday 9 AM, 12/9/16 (Payless corporate, are you reading this?), sees my AMEX card and hands me a bill for $483 instead of $161.  Real smooth, I am about to sign it when I see the light gray on white printout, and it says $483.  I stopped.  He said the $161 is before airport fees, and the holiday markup.  $322, or triple the original price.  I demanded to be taken back to the airport.  He then said they did NOT have a Chrysler 200, or anything in that range, and the only thing he had was a 9 passenger Chrysler VAN.  That's like 22' long and 10' wide.  I wanted a 2 to 4 door econo car.  Never drove a large truck like vehicle before.  By the time I left, he had swindled me in to renting this beast and gas hog :(18mpg) for $305.  Signing up for prepaid gas refill was also MANDATORY.    

I got hell for it at work, as this was paid for by the company, and they only allotted $161 + 20%.  These guys really suck. I'll NEVER go to a Payless (or Budget, same company) rental, ever again.  I ended up paying the difference out my pocket for violating the original agreement - which I could have bitched about - if I wasn't exhausted from the flight, and completely out of my element. In this day and age of social media, it is shocking to think that  Payless/Budget apparently trains their people to trick you, to take advantage of you.  

The deal was for $161 including taxes and fees ""(""estimated"")"". How the hell it could come up to $483 is beyond me - and he quickly threw it away as soon as I protested it.  I SHOULD HAVE PHOTOGRAPHED THE AGREEMENT AND THAT 30 Y/O WHITE GUY WITH SHORT BROWN HAIR AT 9am ON SATURDAY DECEMBER 12.  He is avidly looking for a career in web site development and tried to pump me for information about that.  That's my job.  He shocked me, changed the vehicle, distracted me, and destroyed the proof.  

Payless/Budget:  YOU SUCK.  I got gypped and I had to pay the difference in price to my employer.  It made ME look bad.  AVOID PAYLESS/BUDGET CAR RENTAL.   I am saving the original agreement and would post it if there was a way for all to see.  Lesson here:  Rent from Avis, Dollar or Enterprise.  They are in the Airport, the people are friendly and not pushy.  I tried to save $50 and it cost me dearly.  I got a massive vehicle that I had to carefully navigate in heavy traffic for a week.  I hated PAYLESS/BUDGET CAR RENTAL every time I sat in the drivers seat.",2016-12-19 14:43:30

I think it's a great venue for concerts. On the main floor there are 3 viewing levels, and there's seating on the highest level. For some concerts (those where people will not be getting down), they bring in chairs for the area in front of the stage. There's a mezzanine level and it has 2 viewing levels as well and additional seating along the railing and in booths. The first floor bar has booze and crappy beer...go upstairs if you want microbrews or any beer that doesn't have the word ""Lite"" in it. In the winter there is a coat check. The bathrooms are pretty big, there's hardly ever a line. Security keeps people in line but they aren't dicks about it. I was all set to write a five-star review based on this great bartender being really cool to a much older lady at the Colin Hay show. He helped her look through her purse with his phone light...she couldn't find her wallet. UNTIL I slipped on a random puddle and nearly busted my ass. It was one of those epic near-falls, where I was thinking ""How did  my legs move in all those directions at once?"" A security guard and cocktail waitress saw it (both their jaws had dropped), and I saw him clean it up. THEN as I was leaving, I skied through another puddle in the SAME place. WTF? I realized it's because their A/C condenser leaks through the vent and onto the floor right there. Put up a sign, leave a trash can there, put a non-skid mat (like the ones in front of your ice machine!) there. Do SOMETHING to prevent the problem from happening again and again. Lawsuits like that are how places get shut down! Protect yourself, Vogue! Where else in this city am I going to see They Might Be Giants? And don't say Old National because I do NOT like that venue despite its cool architecture. 

Yes, you will have to walk a few blocks and park for free OR pay to park in the garage across the street or the lot behind, but we live in a city. That's how parking works in cities...get over it. Unless you have a physical handicap, walking 2 blocks to get to something fun is not something to complain about. Talk about your first world problems.",2013-09-10 22:02:30

August was literally the last meal we had planned before our NOLA group trip was to end. At that point, we were so filled up with butter and seafood that we almost canceled our reservation.

But with some arm-wringing and one look at the menu, we decided to stay the course. And it was definitely the right decision.

We sat in this weird semi-private room that had about 4 other parties in it. It was very white-tablecloth, and we did catch some eye rolls, but by the end of the night everyone else warmed up to us (and even sang ""happy birthday"" to me).

Our waiter Chris was a great guy (2 for 2 with excellent waiters named Chris in NOLA). His recommendations were excellent, and he made sure we had everything we needed.

We started out with an amuse bouche. It was egg at the bottom, pesto in between and potato crisps on top, served in an egg shell. It was delightful in every sense. Salty, creamy, crispy.

For our starters, we did the foie gras three ways (if I had to do it again, I'd probably skip this dish even though it was good). We also had the handmade gnocchi with blue crab and black truffles. I say it a lot, but truffles is like cheating. Put it on anything and it'll automatically be delicious. The handmade gnocchi took that dish over the edge. There's just something about fresh pasta.

Our second group of starters were the potato crisp P&J oysters and the shrimp etouffee. The oysters were deep fried to perfection, and the shrimp etouffee was buttery and rich in all the right ways.

Then came time for the mains. We shared all of this family style:

-Roasted grouper courtboullion with shrimp, blue crab, jasmine rice
-Rebecca Lirette's pork - dirty race and yard egg
-St. Mary Parish softshell crab
-Wagyu hanger steak, with burrata sauce

The grouper courtboullion was perfect. Sure, at $36, it was a small portion, but you were hit with the fresh flavors of the grouper, shrimp, and crab that a small portion was enough.

The pork was great too, though I liked the dirty rice most of all in that dish.

The softshell crab was fried perfectly, and all the veggies and butter sauce took it over the top.

We ordered the wagyu steak for our friend who had an aversion to seafood. It was cooked perfectly rare, with a crisp exterior with a delicious burrata sauce on the side. It wasn't no cheesesteak.

At some point, the air conditioning from the ceiling was leaking on our table. We spoke to the manager, and he wasn't able to move us since they were booked, but it ended up not being a problem after the first couple of drops. When we were done with our meal, they gave us a round of desserts for our troubles (the pralines were wonderful), including a birthday dessert. Totally worth it.",2016-06-08 17:24:32

I have stayed here in the past but this hotel is becoming extremely run down. The few bright spots I had were the bell man who always remember us, along with the extremely nice pool staff.

I am currently still staying here for 4th of July weekend; however, my family can't wait to leave. It all comes down to the cleanliness or lack thereof regarding our room. We booked a 2 room suite with an ocean view at $650/night. Upon arrival the room smelled of stale carpet and had a foul odor. Meanwhile as we were unpacking we realized that the carpet was quite sticky in several places. Since we have a 2 year old we decided to start scrubbing the carpet so our son could run around freely. We also decided to open up the door to our balcony to air out the room and that was a disaster considering the door lock was broken and it is very difficult to open the door once you get past the broken door lock. 

Next we turned on the air in the room and realized the vents were completely dusty and filthy. Then upon turning on the tv we realized the batteries to the remote were dead and the remote was sticky. Upon using the bathroom the toilet seat was chipped and the lid was cracked. The caulking and grout in the shower were filthy and the hard water stains are deplorable.

If it weren't bad enough these things take the cake. The room has plantation shutters. My son climbed up to open the shutters and the stick flew off and hit him in the head. We quickly realized that it was duct taped back on instead of being fixed.

Speaking with the front desk it took 3 rounds to get a maintenance guy to the room. So we leave the room to come back to him changing out our toilet seat. At that point I realized the blinds had not been fixed I asked him to fix the blinds and he says ""I don't do that"" and abruptly leaves. Meanwhile the only thing aside from the other stuff that he did fix was our sliding glass door lock which is now broken again.

Needless to say I hope I survive another 24 hours here but am utterly disappointed this situation nearly ruined my holiday weekend. This is several horrible trips at Hilton properties and my wife and I have decided no more Hilton owned properties for us.

Beware of staying in this horribly outdated and unsanitary hotel.",2015-07-04 06:17:59

Prior to that it lived in NYC and rode the subway.  So I have a slightly different perspective from people who compare it to SEPTA. In my view PATCO should have zero to few issues because it's only 1 line that end to end runs about 13 miles.  How late can you be on average when the longest trip is scheduled for no more than 25 minutes.  Having said that I find that this is a poorly run system.  The cars are old which causes a lot of problems when the weather is bad.  Many of the seats have lost all the cushioning and you sink down into a trough when you sit.  Many cars leak when it rains rendering usually the seats toward either ends of the car unusable.  In the winter in  order to maintain the schedule they will run shorter trains at rush hour creating crowding issues and delays since everyone waiting for the end cars have to walk further up the platform.  Off hours the schedules are unreliable at best especially on the overnight.  More frequently then should be he case trains get cancelled without any notice or announcement.  They very rarely communicate delays when they happen, they might apologize the next day via the barely decipherable public announcement system or a printed note left on the seats.  The cars are not cleaned very frequently if at all while they are in service.  They instituted the automated fare collection system called the Freedom Card.  With that you can add specific denominations but not less than 20 dollars.  They will not accept credit or debit cards to purchase individual ride tickets AND you get all your change in those heavy dollar coins.  Try walking around with 18 dollars worth of dollar coins in your pocket.  To add insult to injury they empty the fare vending machines during rush hour.  You have people trying to get to work forced to use one machine while they service theonly other one in the station.  I have had issues where the machines can't process credit or debit cards then you're stuck talking to someone on the customer service phones some of whom are nice others of which, not so much.

They are OK if all you care about is getting from South Jersey to Philly in less than an hour. But there are far too many minor issues that are not addressed.",2010-09-14 14:32:15
tb3vC90vSrX2JWhSApB5xQ,SpuK67B0EVHX0DuMEgPq3w,6dluZtkjgkZksLeBAs50rQ,3.0,5,2,2,"I was very apprehensive going into Midtown. For two reasons, first everything I had heard about them previously was very mixed, and second it was Friday at 7:30 and the place was less than 1/2 full. But, we pressed on and made a night of it, and I'm happy to report all was well in the kingdom.

My experience here was over all very good, I was very fond of most of out menu selections. I was very fond of the color and lighting. I was not so fond of our server, and I was not so fond of some of the decor and I was not so fond of our table.

First impression, as I mentioned was not good. The restaurant was nearly empty at prime time. The hostess was nice and offered to let us pick our table, which would be nice, but as a server I always prefer to go wherever the need for a table is, I'm not trying to screw up a rotation or deny a server their next table. We were placed at a very awkwardly situated table that was too close to the upper level railing, too close to the door and just out in no mans land. It made for a somewhat uncomfortable experience, especially since my head was more or less in the middle of the conversation happening above and behind me.

I still don't know my servers name. She did not bother to tell me, and if she would rather her tables not know, that's up to her. It's probably for the best though because she was nearly useless. She made no worth while recommendations and one question prompted a response of ""it's a banana thing, but I don't know how to pronounce it."" (more on this later.) She was not so bad as to ruin the experience but was so bad to have not added to it.

For dinner we went all in, the whole shebang. Appetizers were mixed, the bruschetta was good, really good, but the portions were too small and the proportions a little off. Maybe a touch more bread to break the acidity of the topping. The calamari was completely forgettable. If you're going to have a staple item like that on your menu, you need to at least do it well, and if all possible, jazz it up. The calamari was among the worst I've ever had, but, like pizza, even when its bad it's still pretty good. Following the apps I had a Caprese salad that I will not soon forget. The tomato's did not over power the dish, the balsamic was perfectly sweet, the salt just barely a remnant on the finish and the Mozzarella was bold enough with out being skunky. It was an amazing salad, I will attend lunch at Midtown on occasion simply for this salad.

Dinner was relatively good. It was certainly not the star of my meal, but it was not the low point. I ordered the chipolte chicken. Which is a poor moniker for the dish. The chipolte flavor was lacking and I'm not sure how they cooked the chicken, but parts were extremely dry and parts seemed nearly undercooked. Back to the flavor. A better name for the dish might be chipolte blackened chicken. The spice on the meat did not come from chipolte but rather from a blackened application, and as I mentioned had only a hint of chipolte, and I love me some chipolte so, I was a bit disappointed.

Enter the side dishes. Mashed butternut squash hath stolen my heart. The side dishes were a mashed squash, black beans and crisp potato strings. They worked together extremely well, however I could have done without the beans, they were a touch watery and the flavor was on the bland side. But when mixed together the squash and crisp potatoes made a great sweet and salty accoutrement with a texture I enjoyed.

We wrapped it all up with the aforementioned banana thing. I normally would shy away from a dish that my server can't tell me about, but the other choices involved raspberries and white chocolate, two things I can certainly live without. The banana thing was tremendous, among the best deserts I've ever tasted outside of my mothers kitchen. The banana flavor was bold but not so bold that it made your mouth hurt, it mixed with a light chocolate flavor and a hint of white chocolate that I was totally ok with. I would call it a pudding or a custard of sorts. No matter though. It was phenomenal.

The experience had it's ups and downs, but on the whole I enjoyed my food, but not the experience. I look forward to heading back, probably to sit at the bar so I don't have to worry about bad service.  I also hope their business picks up, because now that I've actually been there, I'd hate to see it go.",2009-03-09 16:18:37

This restaurant has a really nice location on the water, which is the primary reason we selected it to take a old friend to dinner, who my boyfriend hadn't seen in 14 years. We walked into the foyer and waited a minute, but we will not greeted by the hostess. We walked up to her and made first contact, and decided to sit on patio, under the roof. Our water came very slow. Our waitress was very friendly, and got us our first round of drinks after about 10 minutes. 

We went with the hummus trio, and I was really impressed! It came with pita chips and plantain chips. I don't recall ever having plantains with hummus. What an excellent touch! As I've mentioned in another review, I try hummus almost everywhere I go, and this was one of the best...maybe THE best! The guys laughed at me when I asked the waitress to box up the little bit that was left. 

Our guest's and my boyfriend's water cups sat dry for about 10 minutes. Our waitress came to get our food orders and didn't notice. I had to ask for another round. 

We had the Autumn spice scallops, and the snapper. The meals were very good. The scallops were cooked to perfection, not overdone and rubbery. 

Once again, our cups ran dry, this time it was the beers the guys were drinking. Now, that my friends is almost unforgivable!  ;-)  We waited for another 15 minutes before our server noticed. 

It started to rain during our meal, and our guest started to get wet. We moved our table twice by ourselves since none of the wait staff seemed to notice the downpour. 


Our waitress brought us the check, which was $181 for 2 glasses of cheap wine (that cost $9 / glass), 4 draft beers, 3 side salads, and 3 entrees. I'm perfectly okay with spending that kind of money on a excellent meal with great service in a wonderful atmosphere, but the service was very poor. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, and I won't be back. Such a pity for such a wonderful location!

Almost forgot to mention that we also had to wait for the waitress to pick up the check. I kept watching the other wait staff to see if I could make eye contact to indicate we needed help, but that didn't work. After about 10-15 minutes went by I flagged someone down to get it.",2013-09-20 10:50:51

Firstly, I love the minimalist look on the inside. We were greeted and seated quickly. I felt a tad concerned that we'd end up with a group on our table as we were sat at the end of a long table, even though there were available tables for two. Luckily that didn't happen.
We both got Kölsch. Having met in Cologne, this is kind of ""our beer"" and we know a great Kölsch when we taste one. What makes the experience here even better is that it's served in the correct glasses: tall and skinny. Perfection.
Now the food. For starters we ordered the hot pretzels with beer cheese, to be followed by vacation Kölsch steamed mussels and frites for hubs, and the three beer cheese spätzle for me. The pretzels were good,  not authentic, but thoroughly enjoyable. The beer cheese they came with, however, had zero cheese taste and tasted like flour. Made me crave the spicy mustard that a different restaurant serves with its pretzels. This also made me wonder if I'd made a mistake on my main course, but hey, surely they wouldn't mess up spätzle if they're touting it so much, right? Wrong. Now, I'm an okay cook, and, I'm sure like a lot of okay cooks, I have one dish that I get compliments for all the time...and that dish is, yes, you guessed it, Kāse Spätzle! So, I could understand if this dish was just okay in my opinion, but neither of us could eat it. The consistency resembled cream of wheat, and the weak, floury dip from the pretzel starter had definitely made a second appearance. We sent it back and they took it off our bill. They offered to make me something else and were very apologetic, but by that time, hubs was already half way through his mussels, which he enjoyed, and I went the Northern British way of my background and made a French fries sandwich (back home known as a chip butty) with his frites and the tasty bread it came with.
I have to say, the burgers looked good and you can swap out the burger for portobello mushroom.
Come here for the service (try to get the right size table), the wonderful beer and try something other than the beer cheese and the spätzle and I'm sure you will have a good time.",2019-02-18 20:48:12

As someone who was a server/bartender/manager in the restaurant business, and  part time critique in the hospitality  industry, I have come across a situation at ""Tony's Place"" that has been a FIRST in my entire experience. 

A dear friend and I met for drinks and appetizers, to catch up. We asked our server how the mixed drinks were here, he said great, we ordered double mojitos (after he let us know they are very good here). When we got them, they were served in large white wine glasses, but we decided to let it go since we did see mint floating in them and decided to give it a go. There was NO flavor except for rum (the mint was not muddled to release the mint flavor and there was no simple syrup). 

We really tried to deal with the drink, even added 3 sugar packets, which did nothing since sugar does not dissolve in ice cold drinks. We let our server know that they were not good, and asked for a white wine and tomato juice/vodka to be safe.

WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WAS SHOCKING AND EMBARRASSING!!!

5 minutes later the server comes back with the mojitos!!??!! He said that we need to try them again, since we ordered doubles they can't replace our drinks, and the bartenders poured half of the mojito out and poured triple sec and sprite - WHAT?? We were just told that our mojito that we no longer was partially replaced with 2 ingredients that DO NOT belong in a mojito. We tried it to be courteous (since we were still in shock) and we still obviously did not want it. The server stated that he needs to get the manager. 

In the mean time, the bartender starts talking to us from across the room, asking us how we like the ""improved"" concoction, which at that time I let him know that the first one was not a mojito, and the second was a complete insult - to which the bartender states ""you don't know a mojito then"". WOW. 

The manager comes over, and at first he basically told us since we first ordered doubles we had to pay for them, to this I replied with letting him know how his bartenders just poured out half of it, replaced it with soda, and sent it back to us. Thankfully his customer service kicked in, he spoke with the bartender, we not only didn't pay for the 'faux-hitos"" but he also bought us the new round of drinks. 

After my friend and I left, we ran into a few people outside that asked us why we were leaving (joking around), to which I stated don't order mixed drinks - to which one of the gentlemen stated ""The bartenders are not that great, especially not the woman bartender, she is rude and tried to ""fluff"" drinks"". 

It's a shame, but we will not be coming back here.",2012-06-29 01:34:51
17mc_fixStKuQjLI4ZahTQ,ONQANgDo244EXaZP_naChQ,iKsW6UXL0xxXOT21vWbrIw,2.0,6,4,0,"First, let me start by saying I am picky about my nails. I live in Willow Grove but travel to Limerick/Royersford to get them done since the place I go to normally does such a wonderful job. My regular guy at my regular place has been back and forth to Vietnam in the past 5mo probably 5 different times and is back again. I figured this was a sign telling me its time to move on and find someplace/someone else. 
   After driving passed Polished and checking it out online, I called to schedule my appointment. I booked for a pedicure and an acrylic refill with gel topcoat. While on the phone, I did ask for someone with experience and informed them I am picky about my nails. The girl who I was speaking to, who was also my technician, assured me I was in the right hands. Boy was she wrong.
   Walking in the place is small but done in great taste. Mostly while but not sterile white. It had a nail bar in the center with a few pedicure stations against the wall. I had my pedi first. She filed and buffed and exfoliated like any other pedicure. I take extremely good care of my feet on a daily basis (even sleeping with exfoliating lotion on as to never have a callous), so these steps are not all that important. For me, I go for the foot and leg massage. There was NONE! she rubbed lotion on and that was it. NO MASSAGE! The polish job looked good but again, I can go anywhere and get a good polish. Next was my fill. I have tiny hands and like to keep my nails at a normal, not to short, not to long length.  I told her i like a square shape with soft corners and that while I wanted them trimmed down, I don't like a ""boxy"" look. She agreed. She then took the drill and cut them all the way down to my skin. Yes, I say skin because I felt my skin under the file. I asked her if there was anything she could do to build them back out and she said no. I know that is not true. I told her that instead of doing a french, I would stick with a french pink color (sheer pale pink) as to not draw attention to my nails. They had 1 color for that! What nail salon only has ! color to go to for a french pink? She appologized saying that most of the pinks were creamy and pigmented. 
    Once finished, I got the same ""massage"" on my hands. I looked at the other clients getting their nails done getting nice massages wondering where mine was. I was given my check, $50. Nothing was taken off or not even a credit for my next visit knowing how unhappy I was. Being in the beauty industry, if a client is ever unhappy, i would do all I could to make them happy, even if that meant giving them a complimentary service in the future. That gives the business a ""second chance"" at making the client happy. Nothing here. They just let me walk out. I was not rude, loud or obnoxious. I was polite and respectful in letting my tech know I was unhappy. I even gave her an opportunity to redeem herself by building my nail back out. She declined. 
   I will not be returning her and will make sure I tell everyone I know not to go here. Maybe instead of putting so much money into the design of place, they should send their techs to some customer service trainings/seminars. They will NOT be seeing my money again",2012-08-09 23:40:32

I mean, I wasn't expecting the most delicious food but it was definitely one of the most disappointed meals I've ever had (or haven't had, because I couldn't eat my food). We were in St. Pete from out of town at a 2-day conference next door. We had a two hour break so we went there for lunch on Monday and we had the most unprofessional service ever. We got there decently early (party of 10) and were seated promptly. Our server, Beth (I believe) didn't greet us until about 10-15 min. She takes our drink orders and comes back for the food order. By that time we'd already been there 30 min and were just placing our food order. I asked Beth what the soup of the day was and she said ""uh some vegetable and bean or something!"" I asked her if it was brothy or creamy and if it was just vegetable and clarified that there was no meat in the soup and she said she thought it was broth based, no meat. Cool, I ordered that and a salad. She should have probably checked with the kitchen about the soup if she wasn't sure. I got my soup a few minutes later (as well as one of my colleagues) and they were different. As I ate mine I realized that it had two random pieces of shrimp and when I compared it to my colleagues' , he had none. Told our server, didn't seem to care. Around 1:30 (an hour after our food order was placed) we still haven't received anything. We tracked down Beth and she said idk a few more min. Came back from the kitchen moments later with our food and it was all very wrong and inconsistent. Many people in our party ordered the same thing and it looked completely different. One of the girls didn't get a set up for their sandwich, one of the guys asked for his gravy on his waffles on the side and when we informed Beth she said ""oh well that's how they made it!"" And set it down in front of him. My salad was disgusting. The strawberries were mushy and smelled rotten, and I never received my dressing so I had to eat a larabar that I had in my purse to hold me over for the last part of my conference. There were many parties in the restaurant from the conference that were walking out because they never received food. we asked to speak to the manager, to inform him of the situation. Mike, the manager, comes out of the kitchen and instead of stopping to talk to us, he walks by us while yelling ""y'all looking for a discount?!"" And keeps on walking to his computer. VERY unprofessional and disgusting service. As a person that has worked as a server, I am appalled that this was the treatment Mike gave us. Instead of apologizing, he said that it wasn't his fault and that he didn't know everyone would be coming... As a restaurant that is next to a conference center, wouldn't you want to know what is going on there and prepare for it? No excuses. My bosses were there the day before (Sunday) and told them there were going to be a lot of people coming tomorrow as the conference is two days long. 

Overall terrible service. Mike needs to learn how to handle his employees and learn how to do real customer service. Crappy crappy crappy.",2018-08-08 23:34:25

My hot tub is 20 years old and built into my deck so not at all easy to service. Bert and Sam have been great to deal with! I will post another review after this next scheduled service if my experiences changes, but I'm hoping it goes well as expected and as previous experience would predict.  I did see the one other review posted here and had to comment. BP is a family business. My husband and I own and operated a family business as well, so I understand things from both the customer and business owner perspective. Although I can understand Abdul's plight as a customer, I think he should have looked around to find another service professional... maybe one with emergency hours or a larger company that has many employees and techs on call. Sure, you may have had to pay more for an emergency call, but that would have still been less than paying for a completely new spa. And you could have found one if you had just looked around.  I'm pretty sure Bert and his wife Sam at BP Spa work very hard to accommodate everyone, but as Sam told you, there are only so many hours in a day and they have to have some time off sometime. She was probably not so much laughing at your plight, but more somewhat irked that you were expecting immediate service late on a Friday.   Working for yourself is much more difficult than working for a large company where you can clock in and clock out, and leave your job behind. When you are self employed, you pay for your own benefits, don't get vacation or sick days, and can't even claim disability if you needed it, even though we have to pay into it. And you have to take business when it comes. That means answering the phones whenever they ring (which is usually AFTER normal business hours) and spreading yourself thin when things are busy to keep up with the work, and then panicking about how to pay the bills when things are really slow.   So, please think before you rate in the future. Most people only give reviews when they are unhappy with something, but never when they get great service. And that's just not fair! Bert and Sam are good people (I only know them from using their services, but I can tell.)",2013-12-27 20:27:45

My cat Elda began acting strange & within 2 days she had completely stopped eating. I took her here and after a 4 hour visit, an x ray, blood diagnostics, a physical exam, and a few hundreds of dollars later, they sent me home with Elda after giving her fluids, saying that she looked fine and that there's a possibility that it could be behavioral and they're not sure why she's not eating. I brought her home, kept her confined to a small area where I could find her if she died (cats hide if they think they are going to die), tried to comfort her, and continued to try to get her to eat, with no success. 3 days later I woke up and Elda was pretty much lethargic. I took her to a vet near my home (The Pet Doctor) and went to work. The vet called me & told me that they spotted the issue immediately. Elda had a Christmas ornament hook lodged in the back of her throat and had two abcess area in her throat. They took a photo of her throat with the object in it, sedated her, removed the hook, gave her fluids, antibiotics, pain meds, and then continued to follow up on her condition for days after bringing her home. My issue is, how did nobody at Webster find the hook? It is EXTREMELY obvious. When I called Webster about the issue, I spoke with their customer service specialist, Frank Thompson, and had The Pet Doctor forward everything from their visit to Webster (photos, diagnoses, etc.). Frank was very nice, apologetic, and followed up with me letting me know I would receive a full refund and that he would be letting me know when the person who can issue checks gets in. Okay, no problem. So we wait a couple of days until we receive a follow up call from him letting me know that the check has been written but needs to be signed by the owners. I told him that's fine. The next day I have a voicemail left by the office staff saying that they needed more info to issue the refund. So I call right back and tell the office that I received a voicemail from ""Christina"" and that it was regarding a refund I would be receiving & the woman on the phone replies ""Okay...?"" followed by a long pause, so I had to say ""So can I speak to Christina then?"", which you would think would be self explanatory, but I guess not. When I got on the phone with Christina she acted clueless about the refund and had to put me on hold to ""ask someone some questions"". When she got back on the phone she confirmed the spelling of the name that would be on the check, I told her my name and she said that the original payment was with a credit card in someone else's name... my husband's name. Just to clarify, we have the same last name. So I told her that they can issue the check to his name since they seemed skeptical of me at this point. I confirmed the spelling of his name and we hung up. Later I received a missed call from them again saying that they need even MORE information. So I called back and asked for Christina again and was put on hold, and then someone else picked up (Dr. Love-Songer, the Associate Director) and told me that I would need to confirm the last four digits of the card that was used, so I said ""Okay let me call my husband and get that from him and I will call you right back."", to which she then changed it to ""In order to receive the refund I will need you to physically bring the card in and show it to us."" Which to me is completely ridiculous considering that just 20 seconds before that I could have just confirmed the last four digits, but now I have to bring the card in. I told her okay, at that point I would just have my husband go in there, show the card, and receive the check. The whole time she's on the phone with me she's being rude and condescending and acting like I was trying to scam her or something. As a side note, when I signed my cat in to their office, I had to list my social security number. I call my husband and tell him he has to go to the office to receive the refund. I called the office back and let them know he would be stopping by, and again, they acted rude and sarcastic. Replying with things like ""Oookay...."", and scoffing, which is completely unprofessional. It's not easy for my husband to get off work so all of this was extremely inconvenient for us. They made the mistake in the first place, and then made us jump through hoops to try to fix it. When he actually went to the office to receive the refund, his name on the check was completely spelled wrong. So far from correct I have no idea what they were thinking. They had his name from us coming there a week prior, and they confirmed the spelling with me beforehand. We ended up just having them refund our card in the end. I have attached pics that The Pet Doctor's office sent me so everyone can see what they missed. Extremely embarrassing. My cat could have literally  starved to death because of their negligence. Even if missing the hook was an honest mistake, they handled it TERRIBLY. Do not go here.",2019-01-21 17:58:08
BpFhOLFhRFDSRy4gyP4zig,JfzZ92BlPyhZoQRFhObNHQ,g7GZGJ4K9WzKpuK7zkzyGQ,2.0,1,0,0,"When I saw that Steel City was opening in my neighborhood, I was really excited to check it out.  So, when I went there recently I was disappointed to see the place pretty empty on a Friday evening.  Once I pulled up to the bar and settled in, I realized why.  While the bar offers a decent selection, the food options were pretty slim and offered a few salads, sandwiches, burgers and starters. A small menu is normally fine in a bar setting, however, the size of the venue implies that this place is equal parts bar and restaurant.  No one was dining when I arrived, but I thought I'd order some food at the bar anyway.  After failing to get the bartender/servers attention for several minutes, I decided to enjoy my beverage and socialize until someone finally checked in.  About 15 minutes later, the bartender asked if we needed more drinks and I asked if I could order some food.  I placed an order for wings, and was surprised when they brought over a bowl of whole dry rub wings with drum and flapper attached.  I guess I should have paid closer attention to previous reviews that disclosed this interesting fact.  It would have been worth the labor and mess associated with tearing these giant things apart if they had any flavor whatsoever, which unfortunately they didn't.  The blue cheese dip was a weird consistency that resembled mayo with a few big chunks of blue cheese.  I gave up 4 half eaten wings deep, which was disappointing considering this lackluster appetizer cost about $12.  The bartender pointed out that the wing size was why they were so pricey, but nothing about the flavor or effort required seemed worth the price.  After a single drink, my friend and I made an exit.  It was pretty sad, especially since it looks like they've made a lot of effort to make the place look nice.  It was a really clean and visually pleasing, but for the size and dining space of the location, they really might want to consider offering a better food selection to keep the place from looking like a ghost town. There were a lot of empty seats that would support this critique. The employees seemed to gather around and socialize amongst themselves more than keep tabs on their customers.  After my experience there, I'm not at all impressed and probably will not return.  If they made some menu changes and hired more enthusiastic staff I may return since I'd really hate to see another failed abandoned restaurant in my neighborhood!",2014-08-02 00:01:25
owq2UN2BPsjGABigS6xSeQ,xx-6o9MW5B92VaWmRJwEMA,vWjME92WddneF98IqzaNfQ,5.0,7,4,3,"As I approached the strip mall where Sugarfire is located, coming from the classy end of Olive, the parking lot appeared to be full of cars. I was hoping they might all be there to get some Starbucks.

At the time, Sugarfire had been open for all of about two minutes. It was just past 11 AM on a Saturday. Many a Saturday, I can hardly bring myself to get out of bed by that time, but I guess that's less of an issue in Olivette. There were already 10 or 15 people in line.

The restaurant is designed so there can be quite a few people in line before someone has to stand outside. Before it was Sugarfire, it was a terrible barbecue restaurant that probably never had such a line. The other place of course went out of business, and I think Sugarfire was able to buy some of their equipment from the bank, as if it were Young Buck's Xbox.

The interior design carries over from the other place, and it's not very good. The drink machine is toward the beginning of the line, and inevitably there's some dumbass who has to go backwards in line to get a drink after he ordered. There's at least three different menus before you get to the counter, to make the ordering system as fool proof as possible, i.e. only partially.

The menu is kinda limited, as it should be in a barbecue restaurant. There's three or four different kinds of meat, which you can get as a sandwich or a dinner with two veg; ribs; burgers and a few sandwiches that sound like they may have been designed by someone who was high on weed, and/or Billy Tuttle.

In addition to the regular menu items, there's usually a few special items listed on paper signs tacked to the menu above the counter. Today there was some Asian concoction, which I didn't bother to investigate further, and something called a Cuban Reuben. Initially, I planned to just get a pulled pork sandwich, because why mess with perfection, but when I saw that they carried a Cuban Reuben I knew the lord brought me there that day for a reason.

I'd never had a Cuban sandwich a day in my life, and I'd been meaning to for a minute, since I saw Bobby Flay make one on the Food Network. Alas, I live in Missouri. At least half of what I know about Cubans comes from watching the Real World. You can get a Reuben anywhere, and of course I fuxwit Reubens heavy. No Pee Wee Herman.

The Cuban Reuben is about the size of a brick and similarly heavy. It costs a good $11, i.e. a couple of dollars more than the pulled pork sandwich I was about to get, but there's a pretty decent amount of meat on it. They're not just charging you extra for something that has an especially interesting description on the menu like they do at Taco Bell.

I'm assuming it's the bread, which is toasted on a panini press, that makes this a Cuban sandwich, but what do I know? It's been a while since I've had cable. Otherwise this is more along the lines of your typical Reuben, but with barbecue on it. It's got (as I recall) pastrami, pulled pork, Swiss cheese, fried pickles, sauerkraut and thousand island dressing.

They don't cut it in half diagonally like they do in Cuba, because these people are savages, so you might want to take off your shirt. I didn't, and I ended up getting sauerkraut on one of my best shirts. I might bring this up with the girl who runs the register the next time I'm there, try to get something for free. Maybe one of those $5 milkshakes. (Isn't that what the milkshakes cost at Jackrabbit Slim's? I wonder what they'd cost now, $40?)

Also, the sandwich was too delicious to eat slowly or carefully. It's a wonder I didn't choke to death. The pastrami is sliced nice and thick, like brisket, with fatty edges that you just want to chew on for an hour and a half, until it's kinda gross. The pulled pork somehow has the consistency of cotton candy--meat cotton candy, for adults. They should figure out a way to serve it on a stick.

The heaps of melted cheese, sauerkraut and salad dressing add both fat and texture. The deep fried pickles, meanwhile, I hardly noticed. That's something else I might bring up with the cashier. I might try to get those served as a separate side dish--gratis, since they come with the sandwich anyway.",2016-03-05 20:25:40

Rocket Fizz is an old-fashioned soda pop and candy emporium that will transport you right back to your childhood memories of sugary sweets and caffeinated bevvies. Trust me, if you've ever caught yourself saying ""I really miss that candy that we used to get as kids"" then this is your shop.

The first Rocket Fizz shop opened in Southern California in 2009, and the concept quickly blossomed into a very successful franchise operation around the US. There are thousands of bottled soda pops and candies from all over America, and the store in Carrollwood is advertising over 300 varieties of bottled sodas on the shelves or in the cooler. As for the candy, they have over 100 different types of salt water taffy which you can buy by the piece to create your own mix & match sampler. and then there are the candy bars, hard candies, fizzy things, varieties of chewing gum, lollipops, suckers, and on and on.

For those of us who still get all squeeeeeeee when we're around crazy nostalgic retro and gag gifts, you're in for a real treat. Rocket Fizz has hundreds of outrageous toys, concert posters and movie posters, and tin signs too. The inventory is always expanding.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in the store, but I grabbed a basket and started wandering the aisle. I confess that my eyes lit up when I found a bottle of Abita Root Beer from New Orleans sitting in the cooler, and by the time that I made it to the end of that aisle I was laughing and reminiscing about all of the sweet treats.

I ended up buying four bottles of soda at about $2.50 each:

* Abita Root Beer of Louisiana
* Diet Cheerwine Soda
* Bundaberg Lemon Lime and Bitters Soda from Australia
* Bundaberg Pink Grapefruit Soda from Australia

I wisely stayed away from the candy since there wasn't enough room in the back of my SUV to take home everything that I wanted. The collection of concert and movie posters was a trip down memory lane, and the outrageous comments on the tin signs, and crazy gag gifts were just hysterical -- in some cases highly inappropriate, but some really good laughs!

You'll find Rocket Fizz along Dale Mabry Highway, less than a mile south of Ehrlich / Bearss. It's in the long strip mall that has Lee Roy Selmon's on the north end, and Grill Smith on the southern end. This shopping center is directly across the road from 4Rivers Smokehouse, Brunchies, and Abby's Nutritionals.

Enjoy your visit, have a good laugh or two, and bring home a little bit of nostalgia.",2014-12-25 00:41:15

If you said Sunrise Eatery, you'd be right!
It's a darn fine place to eat at a very fair price!

If you've read any of my award winning reviews (well, my fab fiancée plus a few others think they are!), you know that I do NOT mince words or fabricate positives where there are none. In this case? This is a really easy review to write. And here we go!..

I was flying solo, without my wing wo-man, Fetching Fiancée. I decided to land in a local field like hitting the 3 wire on a aircraft carrier deck. Uh well, actually, I parked my car..but the lot was busier than an airport's on Thanksgiving holiday... 

Even though it was high noon, I got right in and was seated at a comfy two top. Brenda was to be my Sunrise Eatery expert, bringing menu and no mayhem, all with a huge smile! I felt well cared for.

I ordered The Famous Greek Salad, regular size for just $7.99. This salad is quite big, it was more than enough for a guy like me! I love salads, and I loved this one. At first I wasn't overwhelmed with the Greek dressing. It was a little sweeter than I'm used to, but after a few bites, I was tasting its harmony with the other ingredients and it was plenty good. It's okay to have different varieties on a theme, or dressing in this case.

Now comes a brief dissertation about Manny. Since I'd dined here before, I knew about him. And soon, I saw him. This man walks the floor like a proud papa. Proud of his creations. Proud of his family, his staff. He wants to be 100% sure in his mind that there are no problems, no concerns and no one leaves hungry or unhappy! Period!

I watched him approach table after table with utmost courtesy, touching shoulders, shaking hands, speaking with his guests. It was obvious that plenty of these patrons were regulars and have a high regard for Manny, Mister Sunrise Eatery!

I even overheard his conversation with a nearby table, stating that ""They don't charge a sharing fee"". I know this is not the case at so many other restaurants. I realize that a large volume of Sunrise Eatery diners are senior citizens on a fixed budget. This is a HUGE give-back to the community, among other things. Manny appreciates the business and is not on a 'rake the wallet clean' mission. Kudos for that!

Of course, Manny set his sights on me, too! Just about every time he strolled by, he'd be sure to ask if everything was okay, or did I need anything? And, right before I was ready to leave, he inquired without my asking, if I would like a To-Go Tea? I was just about to ask Beaming Brenda for one, but he beat her to it! 
NOW that is SERVICE!

I will say that I certainly left thirst-quenched and well fed. But what I felt most, was knowing that there are still really genuine, polite, hard-working and amazing people out there. And there's a fair share of them standing side by side, with Manny, at Sunrise Eatery....",2017-09-08 03:46:36
fb8Lkx_6Qa17f4LITSC9nA,clajhAbCk_r2GELMZdDSLQ,uyfOQql0ZGMG4WEIwUeeEQ,5.0,12,3,6,"Let's talk about Nolé.

Typically, some of the best new food spots can slip past your radar if you aren't paying attention, especially in a city full of vibrant and modern cuisine such as New Orleans.

As a lover of St. Charles Avenue eats, (I'm a Loyola kid, sue me) Superior Seafood is my first true love, New Orleans Hamburger & Seafood is my darling nephew, Tacos & Beer is my long-lost cousin that gets me drunk and Copeland's Cheesecake Bistro were my classy in-laws who always made me feel welcome and almost always ensured that I made room for dessert. At least one slice. 

You can imagine my sadness in spring 2018 when they closed their doors. Sort of like a bad divorce where I'd have to travel to see the kids 'cross the river (the Harvey location) But never did I imagine that something new and delish would be housed in my beloved Cheesecake Bistro. And then there was Nolé.

I stopped by Nolé on last Sunday after a friend told me about it. Now, originally I assumed it was a new spot someplace else on St. Charles--I never guessed it would be at Copeland's old home.

After a week of perusing the menu, I did what many picky eaters did and selected what I wanted before stepping foot into 2001 St. Charles Ave. Only to completely change my mind upon arriving!

Maybe it was the inside of the restaurant. I was so fixed on the nice atmosphere. For starters, the bar has great lighting, illuminating all of the alcoholic bottles filled with your soon-to-be bad decisions. Most New Orleans bars scream ""You know you want me! Come here now!"" Nolé's bar, however, simply whispers ""Come by, stay a while."" And so you do.

To the right of the bar is a wall of greenery (Are those succulents? I love succulents!) with a a neon pink sign in front that slaps you in your face reading 'Hola Y'all'. And yes, I said ""Holla!"" in my mind originally. ""Mad ethnic right now.""

After taking a seat at the bar, only one menu item was still on my mind from looking at it: Blue Crab Street Corn. I'm a huge fan of elote and I knew that this possibly could be my new favorite place to get it. See also: Meril. Unfortunately, they were all out and my heart was torn in two. No biggie! Now it was time to get to business and choose quick, I was pretty hungry when I came here.

I winded up ordering the chips and salsa and cracklin's as a starter ($5.95) which came with okra pico de gallo, salsa roja and avocado salsa. Instantly, this became my favorite salsa trio. Many spots simply stick you with watery tomato chunks and unflavored pico, but Nolé, Nolé knows their salsas.

I also tried the duck confit empanadas with charred pineapple salsa which were absolutely delicious. Priced at $9.95 for about three.

As for tacos, I went with the corn fried oyster taco, which included chipotle tartar sauce, pickled okra and slices of fresh avocado on top. ($9) As a fried oyster taco connoisseur, I was extremely impressed. However, beware: Each taco underneath this potion of the menu is in fact only one taco. Which in a way, can be a turn off for many. As a light eater foodie, it was no big deal to me, but many can be saddened by one taco being priced between $5-$9 when their belly craves 2-3 of these bad boys. In a way, you could say that Nolé serves a more gourmet style of tacos worth the price tag. Or you could say they're a bit pricey for small portions. Both would be correct statements in my book. 

Let's get into drinks. I ordered my very first French 75 here and absolutely loved it. Light, refreshing and bubbly. A waitress suggested the Cucumber Jalapeno Margarita to me, which I declined but now that I think about it, may in fact be different in terms of my drink type, but sounds tasty. Maybe next time.  

Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and there is no doubt that I'll be back, especially for happy hour. As a foodie that is typically hesitant to try something new, this is a spot where I know I'll be able to explore options close to my liking while also expanding my palate.",2019-04-09 16:47:11

We were promised that we would have a corner layout, with two King suites and one Double Queen rooms.
We arrived at the Hotel and attempted to check in at 3:45, being told that check in time was 4:00.
After we successfully checked into the Double Queen room, we were told the other two rooms were not ready yet.
We were finally able to check in to all three rooms by 4:45.
Now, this did not fit into our plans. We are the grandparents, and we reserved the three rooms for us and our families.
We wanted to check in and get the rooms all situated prior to their arrival.
That is why we arrived at, or before the posted check in time.
It was very disappointing, and created a little time jam, not being able to check in all at once, especially given the fact that we planned this over two months in advance.
They knew we were coming and needed these rooms.
Our stay after that was pleasant, including all staff and particularly the Executive Lounge staff.
The next morning, all three families went down for breakfast. One family, the family that we put in the middle King Suite, had to get back on the road, so they ate a quick meal then went upstairs and get ready to leave. We said our ""goodbyes"" and they left, but did not stop at the desk or tell anyone other than us.
Apparently, Housekeeping knocked on the door while we were still downstairs, and took it upon themselves to declare this room ""checked out.""
The rest of us went back upstairs, only to have Housekeeping walk into the middle King Suite. I told them we were not leaving yet, and she informed us that this room was checked out so we needed to seal off the connecting rooms and vacate this room. She said the room was booked for this day, and they needed to clean it and get it ready.
Part of our family fun outing was to have three rooms, all interconnected, so the grand kids could have full access to all the families.
With this occurrence, now the middle Suite was cut off, and the fun was over. This was at 10:00.I was told check out was 11:00 and that was what we planned on.

On my most recent visit, I was in need of only one thing: a styrofoam hose bib/faucet cover to protect my outdoor spigot from freezing temps. What should have been a quick in and out turned into a circus. First, I went to the outdoor-supplies area and didn't find what I needed there, so I went outside to the garden center, walked around and again had no luck (I also had no luck finding anyone who worked there). Finally, I found a woman who worked in that section and asked her. She told me they were right next to the outside register and waived her hand toward where I had just come from.  OK, maybe I missed it?  I went back out there, walked around several times and nope, no bibs.  

Frustrated, I walked back into the main store toward customer service. On my way, I passed another employee and asked him.  He said, ""Oh yeah, they were on the end cap over there,"" again, waiving his hand in the general direction of the front of the store.  Great!  I was excited because he was confident about this, and all confident men are always right, right Ladies??  Uh, not so fast.  My confident friend kept walking in the opposite direction while still waiving me off and I wandered on again, looking at EVERY end cap.  No luck.  

I eventually did make my way to the customer service desk after logging about 10,428 steps, and the girl there was SO nice.  She actually made me nearly fall over when she did the UNTHINKABLE--she came OUT FROM BEHIND HER DESK and WALKED WITH ME to where she thought they might be and guess what!??  They were there!  It was a miracle, but a darn shame it took that long and that many people to help a girl out.

But, oh, the stories I could tell about this ill-fated Lowes...mostly having to do with my military status.  I must say I truly TRULY love that Lowes offers a military discount, and I appreciate that in recent times they have made the discount more ""official"" by having military patrons register online in order to verify our service.  However, if you have the military/veteran discount access, then whatever you do, DON'T USE THE SELF-CHECKOUT LANE!!! (And if you ignore my advice, then whatever you do, TELL THE PERSON WORKING THE SELF-CHECKOUT LANE THAT YOU ARE MILITARY!)  Seriously--the discount does NOT work at any self-checkout kiosk.  (Don't get me started on how much I loathe self-checkout and feel everyone should automatically get a discount for scanning their own stuff...) In order to receive a military discount in the self-checkout lane, you must involve the person working there who will close out your transaction on the machine and have you move to her main cash register and complete the transaction there.  It's a pain, and you'd think I'd have learned this after the first attempt, but no...it seems I will never learn because it is so rare that a line with an actual person scanning items will be open and available and not have a mile-long line.

Speaking of real people, once upon a time I was in a real hurry to grab an item and then hit the road to get to the airport to catch an early morning flight.  First, I LOVE that Lowes is open super early in the morning and that I can feel oh-so accomplished at 0630.  However, when the person behind the cash register assumes (wrongly) that because you are receiving a military discount you must have a particular political leaning and then proceeds to bash a prior administration and espouse offensive (dare I say, racist?) opinions because he thinks you might share in the same offensive beliefs, well, it just gets your day started on the wrong foot and has you huffing and puffing even as the plane is taking off.  Now, I will say that thanks to a friend that I vented to, who then vented publicly about this on Twitter, Lowes appropriately reached out to me to apologize for the incident.  So, there's that, and it IS appreciated.  But c'mon Reno--you are one of the MOST diverse counties in the state and one of the counties most watched on election night.  To lump every veteran into a stereotype or to assume the military is not as diverse as the greater population from whence it comes (voluntarily, I might add) is just lazy thinking. 

Have I been back to this Lowes since that incident? Oh yes, many times, and I'm sure I will be back, but each time I begin the walk from my car to the entrance, I am always a little apprehensive about what craziness is about to transpire within those huge walls.",2019-02-06 02:18:55

When we first walked in we were greeted by a hostess, who then directed us to a coat-check/check-in desk area where we confirmed our reservation and were then directed back to someone who seated us - it seemed like a lil overkill to me, but hey, what do I know about restaurant reservation management?

We were seated promptly, got our menus and decided on the Grilled Salmon w/ pickled beets & greens for me, and Fried Chicken w/ collards for him.  I also ordered the apricot mint julep.  Everything was delicious! The salmon was cooked perfectly and I *absolutely loved* the side of spinach - I need to take a moment for the spinach (""for spinach?"", yes, for the spinach) - as a lover of spinach, it was heavenly!

I had a bite of the boyfriend's Fried Chicken, collards and ""kool-aid pickled watermelon"" - all were very tasty, but I didn't think the watermelon had anything too special going on, but then again, I was already won over by my spinach. 

Also, my Apricot Julep arrived and was very tasty - but oddly so - it had a salty/sweet combination that was unexpected, but quite good.  More on that when we visit the bar. 

As we ate, the person we later came to know was Booker, the Beverage Manager, stopped by our table to ask how everything was - which was met by our thumbs up! - and he suggested that I try their ""Wild Bird Dog"" cocktail.  I'm not one to say no to a cocktail suggestion, so that was my next round - delicious!..blackberry whiskey may be my new favorite thing!  He also suggested we stop by the bar after dinner - I like his suggestions!

We walked into the bar space and it was very comfortable, lit well, and a nice separation from the louder dining area.  We tried a few other cocktails on the list as per Booker's suggestion, and they were all hits, no misses.  We were also chatting with the bartender, Adam, who gave me the back-story to my salty/sweet apricot julep - actually a mix-up when he grabbed the salt rather than sugar when mixing - but what a happy accident - a sweet/salty cocktail - certainly something to tinker with.  The boyfriend and I ended our nite unabashedly having sampled one of each of the cocktails on their list.  
Needless to say, we left with big smiles, full bellies, and can't wait to come back!",2012-03-31 22:16:10

He fell to the ground and started flopping around like a fish, going in circles, plus his head was cocked to the left.  When I got to IndyVet they took my little guy straight back.  After an hour the tech came and told me he seems to have a neurological issue.  She said it could be a cyst or tumor on his brain or from an ear infection.  I'm totally freaked out, can't think straight.  She proceeded to tell me in order to determine the exact issue there would be 3 different tests that would need to be ran, which would cost over $3,000.00.  I explained I couldn't afford that so she said they would give him meds and I needed to  follow up with his regular vet in 3-5 days.  I did ask her how his quality of life would be, she said let the meds do their job before you make any decisions   She stated they would discharge him within the hour.  An hour later no dog. 
Checked on him at the front desk.  The front desk apologized and stated the techs were busy with emergencies.  IndyVet is an ER, one would think they'd have techs to deal with those being admitted and techs for discharging.  Finally after 3 hours I told them they needed to go get my dog so I could take him home.  

5 days later I took him to his regular vet, to my surprise, he has a double ear infection.  My first thought was why didn't IndyVet check his ears on the initial visit.  Instead he was put on 5 different meds.  These meds are causing him to drink excessively, he won't eat; he's urinating excessively and has  severe diarrhea.  He has to gradually be taken off the meds because one of them is a steroid.  He's never had an accident in the house not even when I was potty training him.  He's having 1-2 accidents a day now.  His regular vet has put him on something to help his stomach, which should stop the diarrhea.  

For the health of my dog I truly hope this turns out to be just his ears.  If it is I think it's a shame IndyVet didn't check his ears at the ER on the initial visit. Also had to call IndyVet three times to get them to fax the information over to my dogs regular vet.  After 5 days they didn't even have his report written.  

I'm giving them 2 stars because of the quick response when I came through the doors. The Vet I'm totally disappointed by the lack of just checking normal everyday issues.",2021-08-18 09:36:07
YejVzWwKjWyhNm5KtrSD1g,tQgI3IR2CfkKJzojHXQBVg,iEu__i-OtzsbfY2j-mZ2gw,5.0,0,0,0,"I met Andrew through my brother who did his mortgage processing about a year ago at a time when Andrew was with another company. He told me Andrew really helped him out and did a great job with his purchase and I should get in contact with him. From the moment I met him and asked my questions, I knew that I had the right loan officer for me. He was extremely courtesy and forthright with his answers. He broke down the whole process and explained to me how he would be there to answer any questions I may have. After looking at my situation, I decided to proceed with him and move forward on applying for a loan. Mind you this was 8 months before the construction of my home would be done but he was still willing to help in any way he could. Fast forward a few months, I found out that Andrew and his team had left the other mortgage lender and started with Seckel Capital. He could of easily taken me but he said it would be best if I stayed with the previous company and kept my, at the time, lower interest rate. I feel in most cases someone less ethical would have taken my account and tried talking me into the higher rate, but Andrew did not. He told me from the beginning that he would do everything in my best interest and he stuck to that even though he would be losing me as a client. So I decided to stay with the other company and that is where the problems started to begin. Since I didn't have someone like Andrew looking over my account, it fell to someone who seemingly didn't care. I was asked to resend the same documents over and over, with no rhyme or reason. When I asked questions, I would either never get an answer or get an answer that just led to more questions. Not one part of the process was easy or understood especially.. To make matters worse, the rate lock payment I initially put down, could not be found by anyone at the company even though I provided all the information related to it. I kept being told ""The person who has access to that isn't responding"" or ""we can't get to that part of the company"". The process became so convoluted that I didn't even want to buy the house anymore. The excitement and joy I had was gone and really made this whole thing sad. The breaking point came once I again asked for the rate lock status and was told ""We can't get in touch with that area, maybe you'll have better luck, so contact our VP"". What?  Why am I the one having to contact a VP to get a status on a payment I made? So even though it wasn't my responsibility, I contacted this person and received nothing in return. I was told I'd get a call back and a week went by with no response. I called again, left a voicemail and yet again, NOTHING! At that point I was at my wits end. Frustrated, I called my brother asking for advice and he said give Andrew a call. I told him what Andrew told me a few months ago and he said to still try reaching out. Worst case Andrew could least point you in the right direction. So after thinking about it I decided to give him a call and we spoke for a bit about the situation. I then realized once again, why I went with Andrew to begin with. He was prompt, responsive and extremely understanding. At that point I decided that I needed to do everything in my power to switch to Seckel Capital. I wasn't even a client of his and he gave me the respect and attention I needed. So I straight up said that if I can give you in writing, that I want to switch, can we make this happen? His exact response was ""You let me know what you want to do and I'll do everything I can to make this happen for you"". That is literally all I needed to hear. Just an ounce of someone wanting to help me out through this arduous process. We spoke on what I needed to provide and when I would need to get it to him. I got him the documents and the Klimenko team went at it. They followed up with me constantly and responded to my questions within minutes. I asked him if we'll have everything done by scheduled close and he assured me he would. What I'm about to say will probably shock anyone who hasn't worked with Andrew and his team, but this group got me my approval within 3 business days. Just to ensure that you read that correctly, from sending the initial documents to approval, IN 3 BUSINESS DAYS! The other company had my file for over 6 months and couldn't do a thing. Andrew had it done in 3 days! I said this to a few people and their jaws dropped but that's because they obviously haven't worked with Andrew. The care, attention, communication and overall experience I received from him and his team is unmatched. He is the Jordan of Loan Officers and his team is the 96' Bulls. If you don't get that reference, then you need to go look it up because what they do is amazing. If you or anyone you know is even thinking about purchasing property, you would be doing a disservice by not calling Andrew. Other companies may win some games, but Andrew and Seckel, win championships. Why are you still reading this? Call him now!",2017-05-18 13:11:01

Service was great, but the food...not so much.  

Starting with my meal, I ordered the steak and cheese hoagie. I paid .75 more for cooked onions. They were chopped small and on a foot long bun I got about a tablespoon.  My sandwich was cut in 1/2 and it look yummy when our waiter put it down in front of us.  When I opened it to put condiments on it, there was no meat or onions 2"" from both ends. That 4"" of a plain bun, and frankly, very little meat altogether. I ordered a chocolate egg cream, and it was okay. 

Neither my self, or my SIL cared for the fries. they tasted like they were batter coated, or something.  My SIL ordered a dinner size Greek salad. It was fine, but no potato salad.  She ordered a gyro and honestly, there were about four pieces of meat, a couple of teaspoons of tomatoes and chopped onions and very little sauce. The pita was chewy.  It did not look good, and it did not taste good.  

My other friend ordered the French Dip and she was the lucky winner today. It was a foot long and cut it 2 pieces. She sent it back to get some cheese on it and they plopped a couple of slices on it and brought it back unmelted, but hey, eventually it did from the heat of the meat.  She liked the fries, too.  

I'm the only one who ordered dessert. I ordered a piece of banana  walnut cake.  Totally not what I expected.  I expect a banana cake, with walnuts in it, and some kind of frosting.  What I got was a standard yellow cake covered in a banana flavored frosting and walnuts sprinkled on the top and side.  It was moist, but  other than that there were no other redeeming factors to this cake.  

The owner, who is really very nice, asked me about the cake.  He said he has a baker that makes cakes for him, and that he never ""had"" the banana cake, so he appreciated my feedback.  I found this amazing.  If this was your restaurant, wouldn't you make sure you, at the very least, taste everything you sell?  

My teenagers ate there recently and said their egg burger was very good.  I think if I go back I'll order a burger, or maybe the French Dip. 

I'm giving this place a 3 star rating for my friend's French Dip, the pleasant service, and because the place was immaculately clean.",2013-05-27 03:06:23

Cue Distrito. As mentioned above, this spot is bright pink all over; think about an over saturated bubblegum pink. The downstairs was where the cantina (bar) was located at. A keen eye will spot the car table, yes, a table inside of a car. Sadly, the car is hidden in the front of the restaurant and next to the front doors and bathrooms. Who really wants this seating anyways? Moving upstairs, we were greeted with Mexican wrestling masks along the way. I found this to be a really nice aesthetic to the place, creating an extravagant pattern on the wall. The top level was filled with more brightly woven seats, along with the hanging kind. Again, a pretty cool feature, but definitely more for show. 

The menu design was interesting and refreshing at last. Lately, menu designs have not been intriguing to me, but Distrito had a voice. All pink type on white, the menu was unique with its many uses of different typefaces; very fun, circus-like, and met with the restaurant's specific funky style.

As for the food, there was much left to be discovered. We had the Esquites, which was sweet corn, queso fresco, chipotle, and lime. Presented nicely in a tall glass, the dish was pretty good. It was very tasty, but compared to its grilled corn counterpart, it wasn't anything special. Next on the menu were the Carne Kobe Tacos. I had high hopes for these tacos, but they fell a bit short due it its non-tender cut of meat. I had to really wrestle my taco here, and it was not expected from kobe beef. The skinny yukon fries added a wonderful crunch to the well seasoned beef. Lastly, we enjoyed the Los Hongos Hurrache. For those who do not know, this was a mexican flatbread with black truffles, queso mixto, and forest mushrooms. This dish alone, saved the restaurant for me. The distinct and earthy flavors all worked together so well. I fell in love with it, and would definitely get this dish again and again. It was that good!

Bathroom area was interesting, with its co-ed bathroom with respective individual rooms. I am a fan of bathroom design.

Service was really consistent, even when the restaurant was filled. Props to their team.

I really want to try this place again. The first time was with a large group and I don't believe I experienced the intimate connection I would like to have with my restaurants. Next time, Los Hongos for sure along with some bone marrow tacos! See you again Distrito/Garces.",2010-11-04 03:12:13

You can eat here day or night. The food prices are not bad at all. Laid back and a place thats nice to get food a a drink.

Thursday nights are College nights, this place gets packed and there are always guestlists to get on and as a result you get there before 11 you get a free drink (if you're on the list). Before 12 there are 3 for $5 well drinks! You can't beat that price. On Thursday nights this is a place where you see ALL your friends, you can't come here without not knowing someone, it has a very local vibe to it,  but very friendly though if you're not from around here. Girls are always easier to get in and guys can as well, just might take a bit longer. FYI: Thurdays are free, girl or guy! Unless there is a special event going on for the holidays. 

Inside: the inside is small, they have a full bar, they have a small dance floor and stage. It gets VERY crowded! So if you can I would suggest to get there around 10 so you can get drinks while you can, b/c the bar inside can be hard to get to later on.

Outside: They have tables and booths. There are about 2-3 tables though that are usually closed off to reserved bottle service. They have a  smaller bar outside, they have heat lamps and a fire pit. Just be careful theres a step/slope in the middle outside and girls with heals need to be careful not to fall! hahaha seen it before.

Drinks: well drinks 3 for $5 on thursdays before 12, drinks are all around $7, great irish car bombs, long islands, amf's, pineapple vodka, just be careful about the seven and sevens (one guy didnt know how to make one and it was tequila in it instead of seagrums rum, come on now bartender!)

O and guestbartending is really fun as well! Try it! :D

Whew! ok.....Overall, I love this place, it holds a dear place in my heart, I've had some great memories here with all my friends. I think I just might be spoiled because I knew so many ppl here. But whether you do or not you will still have a good time!",2009-02-12 23:48:29
2HktUTqbV8choVDrjRYfQg,v0tcLGknvRRIDVwH4LG1jg,7Vy1FHvdD22nzEB6zfaUFQ,4.0,2,0,1,"SHORT REVIEW: It's the small things in life that make the biggest impact. There are a lot of those here. GO. Eat. Drink. Be merry.

LONG REVIEW: There's a lot to like about Another Broken Egg Café. Let's get into the details. 
- LOCATION/FACILITY: It feels like it belongs where it is, on the far northside of the city, not too far from the ritzy Fashion Mall, not too far from Carmel, but not too far out of reach for anyone to come and enjoy a delicious meal. It is, admittedly, moderately hidden in the plaza, and perhaps deserving of a standalone facility, but that's only a minor nit. The restaurant is very clean and tidy, not leaving room for any distasteful appearances. Oh, and they have an outdoor patio for dining in warmer seasons! 
- FOOD/DRINKS: Now to the heart of the matter: food and drinks, where this place really shines. Their menu is a good size and variety. It's not too overwhelmingly lengthy, not too sparse, and has something for everyone.  Our Sunday Brunch today served up Bananas Foster French toast, lobster and shrimp seafood omelets, shrimp and grits, CINNAMON ROLL FRENCH TOAST...and three letters: W-O-W.  This is superior to a few other brunch offerings around town, trust me.  They have all the usual breakfast items and drinks, coffee, juice, etc., but they also have a bar for the mature patron.  A special ""small thing"" is that you can get Bailey's, Kahlua, or RumChata added to your coffee/mocha/latte drinks. (This, you MUST do.). Oh, and though not amazing, they do have beignets, and that's more than most restaurants can say. ...It's the small things. 
- SERVICE: Sunday Brunch is always a great idea, especially with a delicious meal like this. However, being that it is such a great idea, you're not likely to be the only ones doing it.  ABEC sees lots of people on a Sunday, and the servers were in the move non-stop. Methinks a pair of additional Sunday staff would be appropriate to ease the delays they occur when servicing multiple tables.  While service was not bad at all and the staff and management were great to us, it just felt a wee bit slower than desired. Maybe a more efficient Sunday experience would have lent itself to 5 stars.  Even at 4+, this place has earned my recommendation to you. Your patronage belongs here. 

All in all, go there. Get a coffee with a splash. Order the cinnamon roll French toast. Bring friends. Laugh. Leave happy. ...Give it a shot; you're not likely to be disappointed.",2014-03-23 19:23:25
CNUJR0YoBjZLW_4pG1K5eg,s-aE1r0X82_F6YQ-MNoMgQ,azMFjlYACqGkTm6Vin3rwQ,5.0,0,0,0,"We have been shopping for an all natural, organic mattress for about a month... we looked at every option online we could find. Avocado, Awara, Amerisleep, Brentwood, 8sleep, Happsy, Joybed, Naturpedic, Saatva... my husband actually created a spreadsheet to track all of the features (softness ratings, warranties, prices, delivery promises, etc) of each brand. After all of that, we were so confused. We really just wanted to try some of them for ourselves. We decided to take a trip to Santa Monica to check out the Avocado showroom, (4 hours away), because it looked to us like the only place to try and buy a handmade, multi-layered mattress that didn't have harsh chemicals, solvents, or other harmful materials in it. 

On the trip down from San Luis Obispo, we decided to stop in at Santa Barbara Mattress Company because our doctor had mentioned that they had a number of healthy, high quality, hypo-allergenic and organic options that weren't listed specifically on their website or online. Boy are we glad we did.

Not only were their Churchill and Smith beds ultra-comfortable, but the owner and mattress maker, Spencer, was there to tell us exactly how the beds are made, and what he puts in them... layer by layer! This was music to our ears, and after so much research, we were ready to try out the products. Santa Barbara Mattress Company carries some of the most expensive beds in the world, which were also great for us to be able to try, first-hand. Feeling what exactly the most wealthy clients in the world require in their mattresses was very eye opening. So very comfortable... they are truly like sleeping on a cloud. No pressure points anywhere, but supportive at the same time. But alas, we don't have $100k to spend, so we went around the showroom trying everything else to find the closest match for under $5k.

We were able to contrast and compare their own brand of hand-made organic mattresses, and find a combination of mattress and topper that feels so similar to the expensive mattresses, I could hardly tell the difference! I went back and forth between the best $30k beds and the Churchill & Smith beds. By the time we had finished looking, we had no need to go to try the Avocado showroom... Shopping done much closer to home, and we couldn't be happier!

Can't wait to get our new Churchill & Smith Natural Euro 4000 with 3500 pocket spring Euro coils.  (Churchill and Smith is the brand owned by the people who own Santa Barbara Mattress Company). No harmful toxins, carcinogens, polyurethane foams, or VOC spray adhesives. Made the old fashioned way, using organic wool as the fire protectant, and now instead of using water based adhesives, they are going to use their new tufting machine on our bed so there will be no adhesives in our bed at all!!! (Molds love adhesives).

With the topper we added, it feels like the most expensive bed in the showroom... a total body cradling experience for my arthritic back. There wasn't a lot of online info about this brand, which is why it caught us quite by surprise to find out about it by accident this way... by actually going into their brick and mortar store.

Update: The biggest complaint about online Avocado Mattress Company has been that a customer pays thousands for a mattress, up front, only to wait 8, 10, 12 weeks for their bed to be made, when they were originally promised it would be only 4-5 weeks. Once they have paid, people report that there is no customer service number to call to check on your order to see where it went! Their excuses range from blaming it on covid, to blaming it on too much business, and too many orders to fill. When I found over 160 complaints filed against Avocado Mattress Company with the Better Business Bureau, I started wondering if all organic mattress manufacturers might have this problem. 

My silent fears were allayed when Spencer talked to my husband yesterday. Our custom made organic mattress was ready to ship... only 10 days after we visited the showroom!!! My husband reminded him that he hadn't even taken our money yet! 

Parker, who is the owner's son, and Selvin, their trusty long time delivery man, just delivered our brand new bed!!! These guys drove all the way from Ventura (about 2.5 hours away) to deliver it, and dispose of our old bed, for only $100! At every interaction Santa Barbara Mattress Company gets better and better!

THE BED:
I just tried out our new bed for the first time. Instead of sinking into and getting kind of stuck in the old memory foam we had, it feels more like a supportive pillow. All I can think is ""so this is why the ultra rich people pay $100k for a bed..."" and this guy, Spencer, has figured out how to make one and sell it for a fraction of the cost! It smells like fresh cotton with no other noticable odors. I love our new bed!",2021-09-11 21:21:26
9eSvaZ7zr0-AILMc7J6unA,Xgp8shQ9oseGhvvDchVLwA,tRl5RxE_2XAHRcfvpCwgpQ,1.0,22,1,0,"Honestly, I would not bother looking at a place here. The buildings and grounds are gorgeous - as my friends said, it was like I lived in a Harry Potter book - but the maintenance issues are just  too much to deal with, especially given the crazy rents they're now trying to charge for renovated apartments. In my year living here, I had a heater that broke and took two months to properly fix; the new unit was installed incorrectly so it basically flooded a 12x6 section of my living room; I spent weeks arguing to have this fixed as my apartment smelled increasingly moldy, only to finally have the carpet cleaned - no replacement; months after that I finally got them to remove and replace a section of the damaged/moldy or at the least mildewed carpet padding, though the smell remained (it seriously smelled like garbage - just a rotting smell in my living room); then the heat/ac unit in the apartment above me began to leak, and it took about three weeks for me to get the damage to my ceiling fixed. Also fun, mice live in the exterior walls, so my cat had a field day living here--listening to them scrabble around behind the baseboards. 

Look, it's an old building and a lot of these problems are inevitable. I have a lot of sympathy for the maintenance staff, who are all great people, friendly and helpful, and who simply seem to be overloaded as they try to hold the buildings together. For the amount of rent I was paying, though, I could not deal with the endless water problems, the mold, and the fact that I eventually stopped having people in my place because I was so embarrassed by how the ruined section of carpet would occasionally and unpredictably begin to reek. 

Also probably good for you to know: they tried to raise my rent 12% for a second year--so this is not an apartment that will be good for the long term, unless you enjoy arguing down that annual increase. Also, I had to push endlessly to get my security deposit back; they apparently failed to enter my forwarding address into their system and hadn't even cut a check within 30 days of my turning the keys over. It took multiple emails and phone calls, and finally driving to their office to pick up the check, to get my deposit back - well after the 30-day deadline we have in PA. I've never had this sort of experience before, and can't recommend it.

UPDATE: A few days after writing this, I got an electric bill for my apartment at Alden Park...for a period after my lease ended. Unlike the gas account, which you set up and close on your own, Alden Park manages the electric account and as a tenant I have no way of closing the account. Another strike against them, as my two phone calls and two emails about this have gone unanswered. Seriously, don't bother with this place - and I speak as someone who has lived in all manner of ""interesting"" apartments.",2017-03-01 16:18:19
RjuXhMccvreg_k4RZKNieQ,NH_vIbb6YZVSzid4BwawfQ,DXooUrNgWVMR2A14i98exw,5.0,2,1,1,"The area has been in desperate need of a good sandwich place since there are few choices outside of your typical strip mall all-in-ones (pizza, steak, hoagie, fries, etc.), so this specialty sandwich shop is a welcome addition.

I've been eating here about twice per week since they've opened and I've consistently gotten a great tasting, well-made sandwich.  I've also gone back and forth between cold subs and hot sandwiches (highly recommend the Italian hoagie (get it ""Mike's Way""!) and Chipotle Cheesesteak) and everything has been great.  They seem to bake their own rolls in-house too and they're ALWAYS fresh, which is the first step to a great sandwich.

If you want a great sandwich, give these guys a try.  You won't be disappointed.

One tip for customers...try to dine in if you can if you live more than 5 minutes away.  I've found that the sandwiches don't travel well.  The bread is fresh, so it quickly absorbs the ""Mike's Way"" oil/vinegar mixture that they put on the cold sandwiches (if you elect to have that, which I strongly suggest you do!) and melted cheese from cheesesteaks, etc.  If you're not eating the sandwich in under 10 min of them making it, then the roll will likely be pretty wet by the time you do.  I mentioned this to a friend and they suggested that when ordering ""to go"", that I ask for a ""fisherman's wrap"", which they explained is when they place a piece of wax paper over the roll and then put the ingredients on top of that (to protect/preserve the roll).  Then when you get home, you pull out the wax paper and you have a good sandwich with the roll still freshly intact.  I haven't taken out from JM's since my friend suggested that, but may try the next time I go and hopefully they'll accommodate me that way.

One suggestion for Jersey Mike's...about half the times I've gone to your place for lunch, it's been with a different group of friends from work and we've all enjoyed it, but all seem to agree on this one point...you need another size between a Regular and Giant.  We all feel like when we get to the end of a regular, we still want a bit more...but the Giant is too big!  Sure, we probably COULD polish off a Giant if push came to shove, but it's really too big for one person, and we all agreed we would never order it if dining with anyone because it would be too embarrassing and we'd feel like a pig for ordering that much food.  But seriously Jersey Mike's...think about it.  I'd bet that at least 1/3rd of the guys that come in there would order a larger size than the Regular, but smaller than the Giant IF that option was available.  And if your average Regular is about $8 and your average Giant is $14, you could insert an in-between size for like $9.95 and not only would you be making a lot of customers happy, but you'd be increasing your average sandwich sale by 25% on a third of your business.  And the last time I checked, you're in business to make money, right? :)",2016-11-20 15:48:51
epiLZlvmC1d0vyrjNm_r-g,WUmCci5VYl74fMlWEQA3dw,YqoMDkuSbRPjzc39ty4PgA,5.0,2,0,1,"Mai Thai excels quite well at what it is aiming for: a modern Thai restaurant. This is not the hole in the wall Thai place that many of us often adore. This is a fresh, and interesting take on Thai food and atmosphere that really raises the level of quality on several different levels. 
To begin, their interior is absolutely wonderful. The ambient light waterfall and steam down the middle of the dining room not only is pleasing to the eyes, but also brings that dash of tranquility of flowing water sounds in the background while you eat. The bar is modern, but not too flashy. There are several Thai and South Asian decorations, that do not distract but instead compliment the environment. 
Secondly, the cocktail list is absolutely inspired and delightfully well craft. I tried the Brazil '66 and the 'pretty panda' and both were wonderful mixtures of eastern and western culture brought into a cocktail that made you want to savor every sip and truly enjoy your drink. To make the experience all the better, these signature cocktails are a part of the happy hour special for buy one get one free.

Next, the service.
The waiters here all seem to be quite competent and attentive which is a great sign of sure quality. In addition to waiters that perform well, they also have secondary waiting staff that is always quick to refill your water, clear empty plates or help in any way. This is a very beneficial tactic because the waiter is not spread too thin, and you aren't left unaccounted for even at the busiest of times.

Finally, the food. 
Having tried a few different dishes, I can say that that the green goddess roll is always a great go to for an appetizer that is full of flavor but will save enough room for dinner. It is a vegetarian roll, so although not traditional sushi, it is wonderful and can be enjoyed by all whether they like traditional sushi or not.
Secondly, the entrees have all been wonderfully well prepared and presented. The Pad See Ew was wonderful and had just enough citrus to balance out the dark soy sauce. This dish is great for all people that like Thai food, and is also good for an introduction dish to Thai cuisine because it does not have any fish sauce but still packs a lot of flavor. This dish pairs well with either chicken or fried tofu. 
Their Pad Thai was also quite tasty, and had a balanced flavor overall. Where many Thai locations get carried away with the fish sauce, this was just enough to taste but not too much to overwhelm. This dish makes another great example of something that is approachable for all customers. 
Finally: Their curry is quite surprisingly exceptional as well! Thai curry is slightly different than Indian curry, and diversity is always a good thing. Here they make their curry with just enough spice to give you the warmth, but not too much to overwhelm your taste buds and harming your ability to taste everything else. 
The yellow, red, and panang curry are all good options to try. Traditionally I prefer my curry with chicken, but that is a personal preference.

This place I would recommend to anyone whether it be for their lunch buffet, a nice evening dinner with wonderful entrees, or even drinks on any late night for happy hour. This sets a nice high standard for modern Thai restaurants.

After 2 weeks of living here one morning I went out to the parking lot to find that my car had been towed. After calling the office multiple times I was finally told they had ""forgotten"". to give me a sticker and that they would reimburse me the tow cost on my next months rent. It was frustrating that I had to waste an entire day and miss work to go pay to get my car, get the sticker from the office and come back to the apartments. 
Another issue is maintenance would come during the day while I was gone and when I would return my apartment was left unlocked. 
After a. year of living here I got married and my husband moved in to my apartment it was affordable, nice location etc. I was getting what I paid for. My apartment was soon infested with mice, and bed bugs. I had to throw away a couch, my bed, pillows, blankets and pay an exterminated to come out and spray my apartment. It was a nightmare! 
We placed many traps and living on the 3rd floor you would think mice wouldn't be an issue, but it was!!!! We found there was a hole in the wall behind the fridge where the mice lived. We called maintenance and no one seemed to care about the problem. 
I cannot tell you how many managers we went through in my 2 years of living here. It was constant changes and that wasn't ideal. The final straw was in Oct. 2019 we went on our honeymoon and came back to find our ceiling was cracked and leaking. We called maintenance and were told it wasn't an emergency. 3 -4 days later maintenance showed up took a picture of the ceiling and did nothing to repair it. After multiple attempts to get it fixed and no response my husband and I got out of there as quickly as we could. We found out that the manager was leaving too due to the poor conditions of the building and the toxic work environment. After moving out in FEBRUARY we got a call asking if our leaky ceiling was every fixed. What a joke! I kindly informed them we moved out and it would be nice if they fixed the leak for the next person. 

Other dislikes, people wandering the halls, nasty gym, provide own window a/c unit, hallways were not well kept and often when they were being cleaned there were no wet floor signs. 

We never got a deposit back, but I am okay with just not living in these horrible conditions anymore. So grateful we got out when we did. Do yourself a favor and avoid any and all Reverie Estate Properties!!",2021-09-27 11:39:27

It turns out Argan was mere feet from where we were staying the night for an unplugged, living-large birthday weekend.  I generally am not that crazy about Moroccan food specifically (while I like prunes, raisins, lemon preserves, etc., I don't like them stewed with savory spices or proteins quite so much; I am also partial to bigger toasted couscous balls instead of the smaller-grained, fluffy variety).  That being said, Argan's menu seemed to have a variety of options that I was still okay with, and we wanted to go somewhere cozier and more intimate rather than somewhere bustling and clattery or noisy.  The fondness we felt towards our dinner made us circle the sidewalk like vultures the next morning until the restaurant opened for breakfast (standard brunch fare--omelets, eggs, homemade granola and fruit--but with unique touches, like lamb sausage as a side or Moroccan meatballs in tomato sauce with eggs or Kalamata olives added to a spinach/feta Greek omelet.....plus mint tea, which I'll get to in a moment).  

The complimentary semolina bread and marinated olives brought to our table as a starter was the sort of special touch that I always wish for when eating out.  The fluffy, grainy semolina round was tasty and the olives tangy and juicy, complemented by an added hint of tomato to their brine, but what made this extra-memorable is that my father is OBSESSED with the semolina bread he snacked on as a child, and this bread is what he's always looking for as an adult but never finds.  Once he was at a nifty little gas station convenience store-cum-Middle Eastern-imports depot in their hometown, and they were selling giant bulk bags of semolina flour....which he promptly bought and lugged  home, demanding my mother try to recreate the breads of his youth.  My mom made a variety of valiant attempts, but he was never quite satisfied; I'm pretty sure this personal loaf of light-yellow bread is precisely what he is seeking.  I look forward to treating him one day soon.  

Back to the meal at hand: as an appetizer we had the Platter of Spreads, served with grilled pita triangles.  The hummus was good but could have used a little more salt, but I was okay with it 'cause I tend to be judicious with the salt anyway, so it wasn't a huge turnoff to me personally.  The zaalouk and shakshuka had just the right amount of either tangy sweetness or slow burn spice, respectively.  

As an entree I had the Vegetarian Couscous; I expected this to be a little bland, but instead it was just the right amount of savory, sort of like a comfort food bowl that will leave you full and warm without the sensation of feeling heavy or like you grossly overate.  The cabbage, carrots, and other veggies were tender, and their broth/juices made the mound of couscous (which I generally wouldn't have been that fond of) appealing.  My meal was followed up with Moroccan mint tea, which, after first trying at a Moroccan restaurant in Paris, has haunted my dreams; honeyed-sweet with much mint, a small, jewel-toned glass of the stuff is all I need for dessert.",2011-03-28 01:42:24

He never complied with MY request to stop the incense burning because I would never request such a thing from someone practising deeply traditional customs. I left without comment and ended up in the ER that night due to an anaphylactic reaction to the incense. My point with this review was I wish someone had mentioned the incense on the review message boards and I never would have gone to EC. I mentioned it so others with my same health issue might be forewarned as I was not. Again, I would never ask a ""religious/cultural"" venue to stop practicing their beliefs on my account. I respect their right to do this and will opt simply to never return. But to say he accommodated me the night I was visited EC is an outright LIE and tells me this owner has had AT LEAST one other person with the same issue. It also tells me he is not a man of good character if he wuld use the Owner's Response column to lie about me. Whereas before I simply wanted to warn others about the incense burning at Everest so others with my same health condition might also avoid EVEREST CAFE, now I want to warn people about this owner's immoral character. Shame, shame on you. You don't know who I am and how dare you threaten me. I will be turning this matter over to my attorney. I wasn't going to even mention the hospital bill I incurred because of my visit to EC as I am a firm believer in Caveat Emptor - buyer beware - and assumed it was my mistake for not anticipating the use of ""smelliest"" in an ethnic restaurant. But now that you have threatened me and lied about knowing me and lied about accommodating me by allegedy putting out the incense when I visited EC you will be paying my ER bill from that evening. And sadly, all you would have had to do was respond and say you have since stopped the burning of incense at EC and I would have gladly updated my review to reflect same. I might have even returned to actually try the food there which EVERYONE raves about so consistently and which I did not have the pleasure of enjoying when I visited because of my immediate & intense reaction to the incense and my consequential abrupt departure from EC. But now because you decided to lie about me and threaten me I will tell everyone I know to not patronize EV because you are a disreputable and immoral person. Way to go. You should make a youtube video of how exactly NOT to handle an unfavorable review on Yelp!

And I have to question an ""ethnic"" restaurant who would so casually dispense with an incense burning ritual which I would have assumed was steeped in ancient cultural mysticism and reverent meaning. Makes me wonder how much else is just for show with no real meaning and done solely to give an ""authentic"" vibe to the restaurant. And for the record, you DID have scented candles on the evening I was there. One person at my table of 8 asked the waitress what the scent was in the candles because it was making her eyes burn and the waitress replied that it was a ""aromatic blend of several native fragrances"". I will say that the waitress DID move said candle further away from our table. If you have since changed to ""unscented candles"" I commend you. And I thank you for your ""origins of incense"" information. Again, I was simply intending to warn others who may suffer my same medical ailment to be cautious if going to Everest. I was not saying you should not burn incense in accordance with your customs & traditions - your restaurant, your rules. 
It is a shame you decided to handle this as unprofessionally as you have. Yelpers BEWARE - this community bully will demand you LOVE his establishment OR ELSE. Now I seriously wonder how many of Everest's 4 and 5 star reviews were obtained through threats & intimidation rather than the actual quality of the food there.

4fwg6SfDGTsChV9AYMr3ug,kCBMksMPqNPw2dfWH_deXQ,dV8SCuZ-JMPQx4RKDdPotg,5.0,4,0,1,"I've seen these arcade bars in other cities and have always been jealous, so I am really excited that we finally have one here. It doesn't quite hold a candle to some of the ones I have seen in bigger cities as far as games go, but it's still a blast and there is plenty to stay entertained for a long time. 

The location in great; right off of the cultural trail in Fletcher Place. There is plenty of bike parking around the area, and there are a couple of bike share stations not very far away. I don't know what the car parking situation is like, but I do know the street in front has spots if you can find an open one. Inside, they have a big bar in the middle, and then their arcade games surrounding it. They have a decent number of the popular classics as well as quite a few interesting games that I haven't seen before. Most of their games are free, but the pinball does cost money to play so that they can offset maintenance costs of all of the mechanics inside. The games range from shooters, to sports, to racing, and a wide variety in between.  

This is a 21+ establishment, so don't bring your kids here thinking it will be a cheap day of entertainment for them. Their beer selection consists of a dozen taps of craft beer. They have a nice variety that includes a lot of local stuff as well as some other craft things from elsewhere that you might not see everywhere. It appears that their tap list rotates pretty frequently. Beers are a little more expensive here since it offsets the free arcade games, but they aren't too terribly priced. It's around $7 for a pint of good craft beer. They also have a couple wine options and some cheaper domestic stuff in cans. Each game has a ledge next to it so you can set your beers down when you are actually playing. Oh, and don't be the guy who shows up and plays free games for 2 hours without buying anything. 

It's new, unique, and fun; so they are very busy still. If you come later in the evening on a weekend, you shouldn't be surprised to find that it is at capacity and you have to wait outside until people leave. That being said, they do a decent job of limiting the number of people they let in so it doesn't make it impossible to find a game to play or feel too crowded. If you are playing, make sure you only play for a little while before switching games so everyone has the opportunity to play. Earlier in the evening or during the week, it isn't quite as crowded and is definitely when I would recommend going. 

My one complaint is that they need way more hand sanitizing stations. I feel like other arcade bars have one next to every single game, but I can only recall maybe seeing one here, if I am even remembering that correctly. Seems like an idea setup for spreading nasty things going from a controller that 100 other people have touched before you to grabbing your beer and drinking it.

It doesn't appear they really have any room to expand, but it certainly is popular. It is still fairly new, so hopefully business remains booming after they have been open for a while. It would be great if after a while they can start rotating different games in and out to keep things interesting. 

I'm sure you didn't have to read a Yelp review to know that going to a place with good craft beer and free arcade games is something you should do, but if you did spend the time reading this to make up your mind, just go check it out for yourself, you won't be disappointed.",2016-06-10 13:18:21

Anyhow we couldn't get any mixed drinks because there was no actual bartender trained to make them. Then we got our garlic fries and then literally just looked like they had parsley on them. I tired a few and they tasted like regular fries. A friend I was with said they didn't look anything like the fries she'd had before so I took them back up, which was when the guy I got ahold of apologized and said there were a lot of new people working. So he brought out new fries that looked like the old fries with some garlic sprinkled on them. Whatever. 

The wings were delicious. We got buffalo and they were a decent size, crispy under the sauce with wonderful flavor.  The sauce for the fries was really good too, Sriracha ranch I believe. 

We waited a LONG time for our pizza to be delivered. There was one other table of two in there and only a couple of take out orders that went by while we waited. It took forever but finally our pizza came out and it was definitely not what we ordered. At the same time a couple came in for their pick up order and the girl at the counter went to check for it and came back looking alarmed. I waved her over to our table and informed us that we had received the wrong pizza. (At this point I assumed we received the pizza that the couple at the counter had ordered). She said ""Yeah this is the Nobleman."" And I said no, the nobleman has peppers on it and this doesn't."" So she apologized and said I was right and took the pizza back... Then suddenly the waiting couples pizza arrived. Meanwhile ours took another 15 minutes. 

The pizza was AWESOME though. The crust was thin, the pepperoncini, pepperoni, salami and pecorino were delicious together. The meats were absolutely delicious and the blend of flavors was perfect. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because the service was a mess. I get that there are a bunch of new people, as was continually the excuse, but it was really, really bad. We did each get a free beer since we had already paid at the beginning and were not happy campers. 

I will be giving them another try since the pizza was fantastic. Hopefully the service will have improved.",2016-04-23 01:19:39

I just moved here from California and let me start out by saying this place is like paradise compared to what you get in Orange County. Unless of course you are Kardashian rich.

What I like..

The rent is incredibly reasonable. I believe we (my cats and I) snagged an apartment just in the nick of time though - they are renovating and I hear other residents complaining about increases. 

They have a beautiful indoor pool with a retracting roof, spa, a gym with a decent amount of equipment, a weight room, a space for yoga or whatever you're into, a sauna and locker rooms. They also put in a dog park which is great, unless you get caught talking to some of the more chatty residents. Don't they know I have things to do? The grounds are gorgeous with green grass and the parking is ample. That's pretty huge, considering parking in the city is almost impossible, and you'll probably end up needing a garage rental which will set you back $200+ a month. If you're a cheapskate or on a budget, you can sit on the first floor and use up the free wi-fi they offer. The look of the building is pretty cool if you're into history - it's from the 30's and maintains a lot of the charm from that era. Another pro is the area - yes, it's outside of the city, but it feels safe and there are hiking trails nearby. 

We also had a few issues when we first came in - you can set up a maintenance request online and they come when they are free. I was blown away how quickly they came and how friendly they were. 

What I don't like..

For some reason, they like to play this game called ""set off the fire alarm"" until your ears bleed. pretty frequently. We've been here for a little over a month and have heard it go off 5 times. The first day, we ran down the 6 floors (there are 14 in total - actually, 13, but apparently they are superstitious) out to the grass and waited...and waited... and no one else came out. We won't make THAT mistake again.

Overall, for the price, amenities, location, and general comfort, this place is definitely 4 stars.

It might have actually been longer than a few weeks ago but I find once one hits the age of 25 the passage of time becomes transformed into a giant time warp where the rest of your life flashes in two seconds. 

Anyways enough bitching for a paragraph or two, because my experience at VW was a good one. I met my drinking companion here one Sunday evening in January, and we sat at the bar. This may come as a shocker, but there are quite a few whiskey options on the menu. Dark-colored alcohols scream subsequent nausea to me, so I elected to try one of the many cocktails this place has to offer. I actually asked the bartender to throw something together for me and it was tasty. 

I ordered the beer special, ""fuck dallas"" or something along those lines. It was just meh. I was hoping my drinking companion would want to become a dining companion (was actually my main reason for coming here) but he fucking threw me for a loop and switched shit up and suggested we meet some of his friends at another bar for the playoff game. Um..ok. 

After making some bad choices at the next bar, I decided that it was time to call it a night but I was fucking STARVING. I walked back to village whiskey and placed a take away order. I went with the lentil burger and against my better judgment (alcohol played a significant role) I ordered the duck fat fries with cheese. 

It's disappointing that the only fry option at this place is duck fat fries. I don't know the logistics of making fries but why can't you at least have a vegetarian option? Fries are a pretty standard bar food and I don't like being discriminated against for my dietary choices (which one might argue actually contribute to the well-being of the planet we all live on but I digress). I was super tempted to get the deviled eggs but there are just so many calories I can cram into my body and still fit into my clothes.

After waiting a decent amount of time where I was required to move out of the way a bunch of times bc there's no good standing place while waiting for food, take away food man came out with my bag. I almost dislocated a shoulder aggressively reaching for it. 

After arrival at my residence, I dug in. The burger was good. I did the classic ""I'm going to take the top bun off to save calories but then who the fuck am I kidding that sauce on it was delicious, eh what the hell"". I also completely demolished the duck fat fries.

Call it the jagerbombs or my vegetarian digestive enzymes wondering what the fuck was going on in my GI tract but that night laying in bed was not a pleasant one. A few weeks later, I can look back on my experience as a fond one.

Also, from what I could discern, their fantastic tap selection is always $2.50. And by fantastic, I really mean ""fantastic"". They had Coronado IPA on tap. Who has that?
This seems to be a cursed space though, and I was surprised to read recently in the Weekly that Monkey Burger had decided to swing out of the strip mall and try its luck here. This was previously Burger City, which was actually a pretty good place but was so poorly run that I only ended up in there twice. It was also a cheap pizza place for a while.
They have some very interesting burger combinations, all running $8 - $10.50, which includes choice of fries (not very interesting) and (supposedly) housemade chips. Obviously, the more interesting and stuffed a burger you get, the more expensive it will be. They also offer any burger to be changed out to chicken or turkey for no extra cost, and have a veggie burger option that my companions got. They may have had more than one but, in all honesty, I was a little drunk when I was in here. They're open late, so this is a good after bar spot.
Burger came out pretty quickly but not quick enough to make you think it was prepared ahead of time. Now, in Tucson, I don't think I've ever gotten a burger prepared as I requested it and I don't really expect that. However, this time, they came pretty close. I ordered ""medium"" and it was really ""medium well."" However, my SO ordered hers ""medium rare"" and got it just that, to her satisfaction, at least.
It was a very good burger and there were a lot of toppings. You got your money's worth here, certainly. Things were sliding off constantly and a fork became necessary. They have real forks (i.e. - metal) as well as steak knives for cutting the burger in half, which come in handy. I thought it a little dangerous having steak knives so accessible directly across the street from Ronstadt, but maybe they have this worked out.
I specifically recall the bun being excellent. One of those buns that's a little dark and somewhat shiny (from the butter) on the outside but nice on the inside. There was a lot of bun too. I mean, this is a big, big burger.
So another good, locally-owned restaurant Downtown with good beer. Support these guys and get a burger. If you don't eat beef, get a turkey burger. I'm sure it's just as good.",2011-03-21 16:26:51

Carlas Brown knows his barbecue. It can't be categorized into a particular style, except maybe ""mmmm good"". 
My first meal was the pulled pork sandwich. The pork was tender, shredded instead of chopped. That's true BBQ! Brother Browns sauces all his orders (although I guess you could ask fir it dry---I am not sure so you'd have to verify with them). However, unlike a lot of barbecue, Brother Bown's sauce is an integral part of the 'cue. Concocted by Brother Brown himself, this sauce is unlike any others----it has elements of several different regions but comprises a flavor all its own. Not too sweet and not too vinegary, not too tomatoey, it seems subtle at first taste. Just a little heat shows up. After a minute the heat intensified---not enough to overpower the other spices or seasonings, but enough to tell you that there's magic going on in that sauce. 
That visit, my dining companion got the country rib special which earned high praise. Another trip, my dining companion got the Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich. They raved about it as the best chicken sandwich ever. Meanwhile, I had ordered the Pork Spare Ribs, 3 ribs which were perfectly cooked. Biting into them left a perfectly clean bone. The ribs are dry rubbed, smoked and then doused in the sauce and are quite excellent.
There are other menu items including meatloaf, brisket, polish sausage, pork chops, a tuna melt, grilled salmon dinner and a ribeye steak dinner. A specialty is the Smoked Yardbird Leg Quarters Dinner, fruit juice infused, smoked and then served on sourdough. There are also a host of rotating and daily specials.
Sides are plentiful, with either one or two included with each sandwich or meal. The baked beans are quite good. My dining companion swore that the Mac and cheese was one of the best, full of flavor and very creamy. Overall, though, the collard greens seem the epic side, full of flavor and a traditional side that just moved the meal into the awesome category. Other sides include rosemary garlic potatoes, bacon and onion green berms and a variety of salads. Carlas Brown and his staff are exceedingly friendly and helpful, making the whole dining experience great. The prices are very reasonable and there is even a full bar later in the afternoon. Plenty of booths make for comfortable seating at Brother Brown's Underground. I strongly suggest you try this place----it is truly an amazing find in central Boise and the downtown area.

But in a lot of ways I could also give five stars for Marrakesh being one of the most unique and sightly secretive dining experiences in all of Philly.

I've long heard the legacy of what it had to offer, and was ecstatic the moment that I heard that Sari had it potentially lined up as a UYE Destination. And it didn't hurt and most assuredly confirmed that i'd be going when I heard that my friend Anastasia was to be the belly dancer for the evening.

When I arrived I somehow discovered a new part of a Philly area that I've been familiar with for decades, and almost couldn't even figure out how to get through the front door. Yet when I did and shuffled my way up the stairs, not only did I come across a plentiful room filled to the brim with Yelpers, I came across the West Philadelphia Orchestra getting ready to play a party across the hall. Marrakesh is just one of those places!

For $25 plus tax & tip we all had our hands washed in rose water, were handed sufficient towels per Hitchhikers right; and were served some five plus courses of succulent chicken served as both spicy whole and baked into filo dough, savory lamb, hummus, many salads, delicious injera that served as our forks, and then some. While I've had better in similar packages, it was delivered in a tasty and extravagant fare that made it something to be experienced. And they also made sure that the vegetarians and vegans of tour group were presented with an equal amount of courses.

It could be the fact that we were a party of 25+, but the one slight flaw was that the room layout did feel like things would be cramped even if we weren't that large of a party. But it could have also just been the fact that my friend was delivering a tremendous dancing performance and calling for people to learn, and many people were calling my name to join in, I could hardly move because I was trapped in the lavish corner. If you plan on or expect to dance be prepared to sit toward the end of one of the tables, and get ready to savor what might be the best interactive dining experience that you can get in Philly.",2015-08-29 05:11:27

I'll go ahead and state that the only downside to my visit was that I was an idiot and didn't read the parking meter signs that said you didn't have to pay after 6 p.m. UGH. I put in about $1.50 around 5:45 or so, gah...won't do that again!

But on to the GOOD part! Everyone here was INCREDIBLY nice once again! I was welcomed and filled out the paperwork to say that no, I'm not drunk, and yes, I'm over 18, hah. All that jazz, you know? I even saw Ryan, who did my first tattoo, and he asked me how my tattoo had healed ""young lady"". What manners! XD

This time I had the pleasure of being tattooed by Jon Ragoe (Ruh-GO) and he was super nice! He resized the font for my tattoo a few times, put it on me, and off we went! This tattoo was a bit more painful as it was probably 3x the ink of my first one, but he was very gracious in alternating between going over my spine (OWWW) and tattooing on either side of it. I got some script in the Cloister Gothic font (look it up) and was very impressed with how spot on it looked! Lots of angles and whatnot, and if you mess it up even in the slightest, it'd be obvious. At some point, one of the other artists came over and complimented his work (I was secretly pumped at this!).

Jon would periodically ask how I was doing, if I wanted to take a break, did I want to stretch my arm (as it was going numb, hah), all of those nice questions. I was mostly focused on not moving to avoid griping; at one point he actually asked me if I was still alive, hah!! Once I got up off of the table, I realized that I was FREEZING, as my jaw felt stiff--along with the rest of my body, and I was shivering. I think I may have come off as slightly 'in shock' after getting up...hopefully not, but oh well. 

I'm going to have to go back to get it touched up a bit, but hey, it's FREE!!

Thanks once again Black 13! I'll be back whenever I figure out what tattoo I want next.",2013-08-22 20:05:49

We stayed at this hotel many times and have recommended this establishment even this last weekend two of their rooms were booked based on our recommendations. We booked a jacuzzi suite for our 27th aniversery because the night we married we stayed with this hotel. Mind you a month early and a smoking room like we had in February when we stayed for Valentine's day. 

 When we arrived I explained this to the front office. We went to our room to find another person's clothing in our room, we called the front desk,two hours later and after another call to the front desk someone came and got the clothing. The jacuzzi was very low on water and construction was going on all around us  very loud construction. We went to the front desk to ask when the smoking policy changed and to ask why we had to call for the email confirmation that changed our room type on October 1 when we booked September 1? The front end person turned us over to a very rude and loud manager who told us we could leave.i was upset that they would treat return guests so badly. I guess the new general manager just doesn't care for his guests if he will allow managers to treat guests like they should just put up with bad service, dirty rooms and a jacuzzi that is broken? We left and went back to our room as this was our aniversery and we planned to have family from out of town meet us late on Friday so leaving was not a viable option.  The construction went on over our head and up and down the whole aisle we were surrounded by banging sawing cutting drilling the whole time early morning to late in the evening. Listening to bad language from the workers and smelling strong odors of pot almost like clockwork at 7:30 pm. I guess that type of smoking is allowed.

The housekeeper  never had towels or toilet paper on her cart, and I had to call many times but it did eventually come about two hours later, each time. The last day we had to use tissues because no toilet paper would come. The jucuzzie was so low on water maintenance would come add water and chemicals to the spa,30 minutes later the spa was so cold we could not use it called again they retuned to tell us the accidentally turned the pump off and they wanted it to be perfect but it was NOT  perfect it was unusable.  The manager of maintenance said we would get 2000 bonus points  but have not gotten them. We used the spa on our aniversery  the 6th only to be chemically burned both us to the point we needed medication and we are still trying to heal. We left Sunday to receive a call from someone at the hotel stating she was sorry and she would call me back but now it is Tuesday and still no customer service here? 

I was told more than once they would make some forms of adjustment for this horrible experience but guess what nothing was done, no one called and everytime I was told it was up to the general manager  not a word, but charged our credit card full price for a room we could not use without injury. Like I said this used to be my favorite place to spend with my spouse,  but after this anniversary I am looking for a place where we are welcome and can use toilet paper.",2017-10-11 01:22:33

My child and I went for the late birthday celebration for her over lunch. We liked their food. I made a reservation but had to wait little bit. Our table was located at the busy spot amongst other tables where servers moved around fast. Out waiter was kind of slow to take an order but we were in good mood. We understood that it was busy Saturday lunch time. However, the main incident was that our waiter hit our table which led to a big water spill all over the table and on my goose padding jacket and my pants. The waiter asked me about my phone instead of apologizing sincerely first. Luckily, I put away my phone right before that happened. However, my seat and clothes got wet. I had to move my seat  which was farther away from my child. She got upset. They cleaned up my table but I couldn't stay eat because of wet clothes. I told the waiter my jacket got wet. Too embarrassing to say that my pants got wet. He didn't apologize but immediately said he would tell a manager who came and apologized but stated ""accident happens."" He offer for dry cleaning if stain remains later. However, he didn't answer but told me to call a restaurant when I asked his name and contact info. I started getting frustrated due to their attitude. It was not wine so stain won't be a problem but it was expensive goose down padding. 
Waiter didn't come back to ask me anything else I needed although he checked on the next table. I had to stop him and asked to bring me more napkins. He brought 2-3 more but was not enough. I didn't feel like to bother him again but wanted to leave ASAP. I couldn't eat at all but spent time on trying to absorb water out of my clothes with limited napkins as much as possible until my food was packed as I requested. We had to cancel all following birthday plans in order to come back home to change my clothes. My daughter was very sad and upset as well. 
I think that we may have felt better if they apologized sincerely and came to check up on us before I reached out to a waiter.
 Although I liked their food, I wouldn't go back there any more since I don't know when I may get spilled by a waiter again. What if my iPhone got wet? Also, I think that table was unstable and wabbly. Otherwise water wouldn't spill that severely.
 Very disappointed by their attitude and overpacked environment. They should open up the upstairs which was closed empty while the first floor was over crowded.",2019-03-03 08:07:55

We needed work throughout our house - lots of patchwork from walls we tore down, new flooring installed in the kitchen that needed to match the rest of the room, and every room and the stairs sanded and stained. The work is IMPECCABLE. The new floor matches the old floor perfectly and it's impossible to see where the patchwork was done. I have no idea how he was able to match new flooring to floors that were installed 60 years ago - be he did it seamlessly. 

His dust-less floor sanding process is amazing. We recently had the entire house primed and painted and were worried about ruining the paint but the house was literally dust-free when he was finished. We didn't even have to dust or clean when we got back into the house!

I also really appreciated Joe's constant communication and his daily updates. He always let us know what was going to be done the next day and he even sent picture updates at the end of each work day. We looked forward to getting the text messages with the pictures every night. He kept us in the loop and made us feel like we were involved throughout the entire process. We knew exactly what was happening, which is such a great feeling when you are having work done at your house.

Joe's attention to detail, his precision and his dedication to his craft is visible in every room of our house. He was patient as we made our decisions, he worked with our schedule (he worked nonstop!) and he is probably the nicest guy ever. 

We weren't sure what color to choose - we like dark wood but didn't want to make the rooms feel smaller. He tested so many stains for us and helped us select the perfect color that gave us the dark look that showed all of the wood grain detail while still making the rooms feel big. We went with special walnut - it's beautiful! 
 
He also answered all of our questions within minutes. We felt like he was constantly available to us.  

I was speechless when I saw the floors. I really didn't think they would look this good but it's the first compliment we hear when people come to see our new house. This is a big investment, but you cannot go wrong with Joe from Hudson. He's amazing and his work is perfection.",2014-07-31 02:21:25

The food, simply put, was ""hideous"" as my husband described as we left skid marks leaving the parking lot.  I really wanted to like this establishment.  We have a list of tried and true places to dine and we were hoping to find some new venues.  

The staff was friendly and service was good. The place was virtually empty and because it was an early weekend evening in the Brandon/Valrico area, that is never a good sign.  The decor was actually quite cool looking but the food...was awful and hours later I am still dealing with an upset stomach.  I don't know who thought of the pairings and the very weird sauces but if it is the chef, he/she needs to be fired.  

The tiny side salad was served on a bread plate so it kept flying off the plate and onto the table.  We paid $10 for two of the smallest side salads I have ever seen.  The salad turned out to be the best part of the dinner.  I ordered the scallops.  How can you screw up scallops?  They found a way.  The scallops were drenched in some rich weird sauce and served over shelled edamame that also was drenched in the heavy, rich and weird tasting sauce.  I also paid $18 for 3 scallops.  However, they were so bad that I was happy there were no more.  I guess my face said it all as they asked me about my meal.  I said the scallops were ok (I was being nice)  but the mountain of sauced drenched edamame was too weird.  They brought me another side dish.  It was smashed up root vegetables drenched with a sweet sauce that tasted like Cinnabon icing.  My stomach was churning now.  I didn't want to complain as it wasn't the staff's fault and I could tell this isn't a place doing a bang up business.   My husband  had the Meatloaf Wellington for $25.  My husband stated that it tasted like some weird meat in a pastry covered with Cinnabon icing.  Yes-- they put that sweet stuff under the meatloaf.  They also had cilantro and other spices that just don't bode well with meatloaf.   When asked how his meal was, all he could say was ""interesting""  My husband never complains and doesn't like to make a fuss so we paid the bill and left.  He didn't order dessert as he always does either.  As soon as we got in the car, he told me that the meal was ""hideous"" --- I agree.  It was hideous and very expensive.  It seems that this restaurant is trying very hard to be a cool, high end fusion type restaurant but it truly misses the mark.  I don't think this place will be around much longer unless they bring in a new chef who understands that you can't smother food with weird pairings and heavy,  badly thought out creamy sauces.  I kid you not, I am still nauseated from whatever was in those sauces from hours ago.   We will never be back.  I am really sorry about that too.  I hate posting bad reviews but this was so exceptional that only good can come from it.  Save yourselves a lot of money for a terrible meal or maybe the owners will try all their own dishes.  Good luck.",2018-07-02 04:47:00

I booked my most recent appointment with Dot. My new place is about half of the size of my last place. In addition, I moved all of my living and dining room furniture out on my patio. My bedroom furniture takes up majority of the carpet space, so I expected to pay no more than what I had paid before.

I waited for the technician who showed up over 1 hour late with no explanation! He pulled a dirty, portable carpet cleaning machine out of the back of his pick up. Their machines are not even truck mounted! 

He walked around my front room and handed me an estimate of $300 for the living room, dining room and a small chaise lounge! The technician said it was so expensive because of the stains in the dining room. I insisted that I only wanted a basic carpet cleaning, coupon price $59.99. The dining room carpets obviously needed to be replaced but this is a rental and I just wanted to have them disinfected. (My family had a carpet cleaning company-I understand carpets) He refused to just clean the carpets without charging me for the spots.

He started to clean the living room and I stopped him and asked if he was going to clean the bedrooms first so he didn't drag his dirty equipment over the clean carpets....He dropped his wand and said he didn't even know he was scheduled to clean the whole house and the bedrooms would cost an additional $100! Bringing the total to $400! 

I was of course upset and immediately called Dot (the person I set the appointment with) as well as Greg the owner. While I was making these calls, the technician rudely says,     ""You need to hurry I am going to be late, I have another appointment!""

After talking to Greg, who tried to belittle me multiple times during our conversation, I ended up getting the price down to $200! When the technician called Greg to verify that he agreed to $200, Greg denied the conversation! I paid the $200 and no more. I only paid the $200 because half of my furniture was on my front porch and I had guests coming that next week.

The stains came back within two days as I told the technician they would.....I wasted $200 and spent half my Sunday dealing with these guys..... This experience was Absolutely horrible! Go elsewhere!",2010-09-01 18:10:44

We each had a Deluxe Burger & Fries. After eating while hubby kept our table, I went back & ordered a chocolate custard Concrete Mixer with Cookie Dough and Pecans for me & a 2 dip Turtle sundae with vanilla custard for hubby. This location opened on 12/31/18. Today it was very busy & the incoming steadily continued; required waiting in line to order.  Understandable since it is a new option in our town with little options. The employees handled the crowd well & were friendly. The burgers included all the fixing's. As a basket we each got the burger, fries, & a drink (self-serve drink). The price was $8.39 each basket. After ordering & paying we were given a #stand to put on our table. The food was brought to us in a timely manner considering the crowd. The burger was good although to us not as good as Five Guys & not as cheap as Steak & Shake (we like their Garlic Burgers). The butter on the outside of the top bun makes the burger very messy to eat, but we stuffed ourselves anyway! The meat thickness is about the same as F.G. & S&S. We really went to Culver's for the custard however we were disappointed in those. My concrete mixer was 1 1/2"" from the top of the cup (I measured cup at home) & had a big cave-in in the middle.  Hubby's 2 dip sundae didn't get near the top of his cup & had very little choc & caramel in it. For $5.59 & $4.99 - DQ here we come back! Why ask the customer what size they want if the customer isn't even getting that much? When I ordered my concrete mixer I asked, ""How many add-ins do I get for the same price?"". I was told 2. But after getting home I checked the receipt & I was charged $1 extra for the pecans. That $1 won't break me, but why wasn't it mentioned? I called & asked for a manger. The male person answering said ""Ok, you can talk to me."". I told him all of the above & he said he was sorry & he'd make sure the new employees were informed how to do it correctly. He said the mixer should have been to the line immediately below the cup top. He didn't explain if the sundae serving was normal. So, for us since we try to not indulge too often, when we do go out to eat lots of calories it is important to us - even if it is fast food. We know how great the Blizzard servings are at DQ Clermont (Brownsburg DQ is also stingy with their ice cream treats), so we won't be taking pot luck at Culver's Brownsburg. Plus we really like Five Guys burgers & fries, so why go to Culver's for that. Ending, I need to mention that our only other visit to a Culver's was the one in Plainfield. Our custard treats there were plentiful & we were very pleased. If we want custard again, we'll go to Plainfield.",2019-01-02 18:00:02

This morning, after my dash tells me that my tire pressure is low, I pull over into the empty lot behind this shit hole to take a look. Somehow I had utterly torn the tire and wasn't going to make it home on the flat. 

I popped the trunk and removed my kit. Within minutes, a grey haired man pulled in and slowed down, almost to a stop, but said nothing and kept going. He pulled in the first space nearest the business and went inside. 

After about 15 minutes I realized that my life g nuts were on too tight for my manual tool and I called for help with roadside assistance. They arrived in under 20 minutes and began work immediately. The grey haired man walks across the lot, looks directly at me and says nothing... he walks over to the front of my vehicle and speaks to the repair man saying ""how long are you going to be here? If you're not gone by 11am I'm going to tow you!"" 

Pardon me, but I'm certain that you're aware who the vehicle belongs to since you looked directly at me when you got here so show me some respect and direct your cowardly aggression towards me and not the service provider. 

The repair technician was wonderful. He responded directly at the man saying that he was helping me to change a tire (obviously) and that we would be out of the lot as soon as he could ensure my vehicle was driveable. The grey haired man actually repeated the threat and said the lot was for customers only before turning around like a child and storming off. 

Complete A-hole. 

The tech was not moved. He took time to complete the tire replacement even ensuring the tire had sufficient air. We talked about a good place to purchase a new tire and then parted ways. 

Look, it's 2017. I have no grand ideas about chivalry and have no expectations that a man would lend any help to a female stranger. However, I do expect that a business owner would show some damn compassion to a person making an active effort to NOT be stranded. At no time was my vehicle unattended, my time there was less than 40 minutes (all in) and quite honestly, it's not throwing off the feng shui of your precious parking lot.

When you want a drink, bypass the menu that reads like you're at a IHOP (think of drink names along the lines of Rootie Tootie Fresh N' Fruity) and just tell your server what you like. You want something with Gin, with Vodka? Fruity or dry and let them run with it. You won't be disappointed.  

Then glance at the food menu, take a deep breath because it can be overwhelming, but remember it's small plates so you really can try a little of everything if you want. Or do what I do and always invite friends so you can share and try more! Sneaky, I know! Oh and be sure to check in on Yelp for your free chips and blue cheese sauce. Never thought they would go together so well, but it worked. So first round each person takes a stab at the menu: Goat Cheese Fritter, Vaca Frita with Chimichurri, Christians and Moors with Plantains and Piquillo Poppers with Diablo Verde. The fritter is amazing, but there is only 1 of them so either be prepared to share or dive in quickly. The Vaca Frita was delish, melt in your mouth crispy shredded beef on a smooth potato puree. The Piquillo poppers were great also, not quite your Sonic poppers, but a roasted red pepper with goat cheese and a green sauce that had great rich flavors without being too hot. The Christians and Moors weren't bad, just not my cup of plantains. 
Not quite full and ready to continue exploring the menu we move onto round 2: Cabrales Cigars, bacon wrapped dates, chicken skewers and Quinoa a la Docs Mom and Piquillos. I'm not a smoker, but those cigars will have me coming back for more. The Spanish blue cheese really complemented the dish without being overpowering. The dates weren't as good as the ones at Mojo, which are my favorite. Sorry. They were sweet and had a strange tang to them that I couldn't place. The chicken skewers were exactly what you would expect which fell flat with me. Lastly, Quinoa a la Docs . A large portion of roasted red peppers mixed with quinoa, almonds and raisins and served in a sofrito. Normally this wouldn't attract my attention (another reason to bring company), but it was so good and each aspect stood up for itself so there was so much flavor. YUM!

Attentive service and great food. We had the shakshuka bake, braised pork hash, brioche sourdough French toast and toasted mesquite and granola pancake. I'll start with the shakshuka bake, mostly because the size of it seemed like a starter. My husband even mentioned he would rather pay more for it and get more. The sauce was seasoned perfectly. Great tomato flavor and not overly spicy. The cotija cheese added the perfect amount of salt to the dish. Unfortunately, I was left searching for the pork belly. It came in the form of what seemed like diced up bacon. The confit potatoes that came with it came with an overwhelming raw sage flavor that overpowered any bite with a potato involved. The actual sauce with eggs and toast were great, but could have been a bit more substantial. Next up was the braised pork hash. It was advertised with gochujang but we couldn't really taste it. The potatoes it came with were delicious. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with great seasoning. The chili crunch sour cream was a nice component to dip the potatoes in. The Japanese bbq braised pork tasted reminiscent of birria. Of the two savory dishes, this one was definitely better and more filling.  It also came with some peices of pickled red onion which help to cut through the heaviness of the dish with some acid. The Brioche French toast my husband loved. I was on the fence. The flavors were there but the bread was sliced so thick it wasn't able to soak up the egg mixture that gives French toast that delicious custard texture. Because of that the bread barely soaked up any egg  and had the texture of a doughnut. Like I said my husband enjoyed it but I thought they were just so so. If I had wanted doughnuts, I would have gone for doughnuts. I am also a stickler for menu descriptions matching the food being served. The French toast said it came with a guajillo and date butter that I didn't taste at all. The pancake on the other hand was great. The brûlée's bananas and candied granola were a great compliment to the dense pancake. We plan on eating here again to try the dinner menu. But it wasn't a brunch that was amazing enough for me to want to be back soon.",2021-07-05 00:45:50

Apparently, I went to Riddles when I was a kid, but I don't remember a thing about it. I'm approaching it without the ghosts of restaurants past haunting the review.

Three Kings is a great place to get dinner. There are a few items on the menu that are outstanding, particularly the BBQ Pulled Pork Sliders and and the Sweet Potato Fries. The fries are a wonderful addition to the traditional choices for sides, and, in my opinion, are better than regular fries with a little salt and some ketchup. I've had the burgers here, and they're decent. Not the best burgers ever, but certainly not the worst.

I also love that apart from the regular selections, there always seem to be at least three or four off-menu specials every night, including the soup and slider ""of the moment."" I tend to get very monogamous in my dinner selections; I find a food I like, and I marry it. Having something new every time I go in increases my chancing of...cheating? I guess that's not the best metaphor. But I like having new and enticing options every time I go in!

One of the biggest boxes that Three Kings checks are the servers. The waiters and waitresses are friendly and attentive. You won't have an empty water glass for long, and service is speedy. I'm not a beer drinker, but I have a beer snob for a parent, and he is always very pleased with the knowledge of our servers, who don't just know their stuff, but are passionate and happy to share that passion with you. There was a night where we went in, and we got a five minute review of Bell's Hopslam, which was in high demand and low supply. My dad got his beer, and got to talk beer-nerd for a while.

The only downsides of Three Kings are the music and a little of the selection. Most of the decor is great. There are plenty of TV's, lots of games on the TV's, and, for a historian, AWESOME photos of the Loop as it was in the early 20th century. The music is good, its just too loud to have a decent conversation. You have to shout over the songs. The only other quibble I have is that they have a late night menu that I would love if they offered it all day. And its written there all day. Tempting me. But unavailable.

I guessed that it was woefully understaffed and confirmed my suspicions by finding about 30 jobs posted online for this location. The employees that we encountered were polite and professional and that's the only reason I can give this review even 3 stars. 

While our room was clean upon arrival, there was no housekeeping service during our stay and didn't happen even upon request. However, I ran into a housekeeper in the hallway and she kindly exchanged our towels. Otherwise, the hotel needs a deep cleaning inside and out - and I mean all the way out to the street. We were dodging smashed gummy bears and ""celebratory whatnot"" while walking into the hotel and the one elevator that was temporarily working stank of spilled beer in the corner. I would guess Heineken by the odor. 

Now about that temporarily working elevator. I walked through the lobby on Saturday afternoon and was alerted by the desk clerk to use ""additional elevators"" due to a malfunction of both lobby units, one of which did not work for the duration of our stay. After following the signs through the dining room, then the kitchen, then a back door to where in the heck I had no idea I was going, I was greeted by a security guard at the service elevator doors. The guard kindly explained that once I arrived on our floor, I should go through the wood door after exiting the elevator. He warned me not to use any other doors, else I would find myself so lost and alone that I would end up talking to a ball named Wilson! Fortunately, I used the correct door and was reunited with my family without incident.

We enjoyed a good breakfast in the dining room each morning, but I was sad to see overworked and undermanaged staff doing their best to serve guests. These folks were clearly working hard, but were not adequately trained as table servers and I observed several instances of guests acting rudely toward them as a result. While we will never rid the world of boorish behavior, the problem in general may be solved through better management.

The food is excellent and the main reason I keep coming back. There are a few cons to this restaurant, which I will get into, but on the whole it is my first choice for Italian food in Tucson.


The experience:

You walk into the restaurant through an ornate door and are always greeted promptly by the hosts. I've even been apologized to for a five second wait at the door. We always make reservations for dinner (which I recommend because this place is popular!) but for lunch I've walked in a few times. You get some really delicious and crispy bread with a basil/parmesan dipping sauce. Amazing!

For appetizers, I have had:
the antipasto for two
the fresh burrata cheese
and the grilled asparagus and parma prosciutto. 

The antipasto is by far my favorite, and I've even ordered it as a main a few times. It comes with some amazing garlic toast (the aforementioned bread toasted with garlic) which can be hard on the roof of your mouth but still tastes delicious. The asparagus is the best I have ever had, which might sound weird to some people, but all I can say is that it's grilled to perfection and you have to try it (which is why we've ordered the asparagus app by itself before). The prosciutto is typically very rich and buttery, although there was one time where it tasted rather like plastic, unfortunately.

The fresh burrata cheese was a spontaneous order for us, and while I am a cheese lover I had never had burrata before. It is served cold and has somewhat of a cream cheese/sour cream flavor. I have to say I didn't love it, but I think that was largely personal preference.

For pasta/mains:

the seafood lasagnette
the chicken and asparagus risotto
the fish of the day (sea bass)
and, of course, the seafood soup.

The lasagnette is absolutely fabulous. All of their mains are served in HUGE portions. I saw a few people complaining about, but seriously? Just eat what you want and leave the rest! Anyway, the lasagnette is very clearly handmade (in a good way), and the pasta is very delicate and delicious. It comes with spinach and seafood in a tomato based sauce, all of which is reminiscent of your home lasagna only so much better. You can tell a lot of work goes into their dishes when you order a main course.

The seafood soup is one of our all time favorites, and I think a lot of people feel the same. It is a GENEROUS portion of fish (some of the largest scallops I have seen in my life) in a light but filling tomato/red pepper broth with some fettuccine on the bottom. I have to say I barely ever get to the fettuccine because I am so full from the rest of the soup. In addition to the scallops, you get salmon and shrimp, and it gets topped with parsley flakes which do wonders with the other flavors in the dish. It is a very warm and filling meal which we absolutely love.

Finally, for dessert:

tiramisu
gelato of the day
and the molten lava cake.

The tiramisu, of course, is masterfully done, with an espresso flavor to it as well as a perfect little cake. This has satisfied our tiramisu cravings many times. The lava cake is worth the wait, especially if you are a chocolate fanatic. It is served warm.

Now, for the less-positive notes:

While the view is exceptional, the interior does seem kind of dated to me. The worst part is the chairs. They are extremely uncomfortable and hard with barely any cushion. Honestly, patio chairs are more comfortable.

And to the somewhat more disappointing part. I don't know if it is because of my apparent age or what, but I've had some sad service more than once in coming here, especially if I have dined alone. One thing I want to mention about myself: I worked in a restaurant in college so I know how hard it can be, and I think I always tip pretty well. But there have been a few times where it seems like I am not taken seriously by the servers, whether it's because I'm by myself or that I look too ""young"" to be eating in a ""grown up"" restaurant. Like maybe I can't pay or something. I'm often forgotten or ignored if I come in alone, and the service has been quite brisk a few times. It's worth mentioning that these experiences are mainly during lunch. The manager has always been very pleasant to me, and I think the restaurant management/owners would be sad to know that this goes on during their lunch hours. I know I'm not the first to complain about bad experiences while dining alone. I get the view that one tops are taking up ""real estate"" in your restaurant, but I typically order a lot, am friendly, and honestly single diners are just part of owning a restaurant. Hopefully this behavior ends soon.

One last thing. Please do not bring your children unless they can behave. It ruins the experience for the rest of us. Last time, the teenagers next to us were singing and the parents did nothing. I understand having children is difficult, but this restaurant is an experience where a babysitter is a valuable tool.",2016-03-03 08:25:34

Upon sitting down, my friend and I had already scoped out the menu and yelp reviews on dishes. We settled for 3 plates: Shrimp&Grits, Crab&Brie Crepe, and Spinach-Egg-Bacon Crepe.

We further asked the server is she would recommend us try anything else. She noted that we have already marked down the best in the house.

I ordered a Chai Latte before hand. I have a cats tongue so I did appreciate the latte not being scolding hot. However, I can see that also being a downfall to other customers.

Spinach Crepe - It's one large aesthetic crepe with an egg sitting on top 2 strips of bacon, wrapped in crepe. The spinach was plentiful and super creamy. This dish and it's spinach was a little too much for me. But if you must have your spinach, this plate is for you. (2.5/5)

Shrimp&Grits - If you guys read some of my reviews, you'll know I'm a hard critique on this dish. I'm on the search for the best Shrimp&Grits in the city. Cafe Conti delivered something interesting. The grits were really fluffy and had good texture. However, the sauce is on the watery side and there was hardly any, leaving the grits to be bland. The shrimp was fresh and plump. It was a little too salty, but I take it to season up the grits. What took my away was the garnish. If remember correctly, it bell peppers and onion. I didn't know how to feel about it because I never had Shrimp&Grits with such garnish. I gave it a try and the vegetables were a little over done, but tasty. Ultimately, I don't think it should be on the dish. The dish overall lacked flavor and counted on the ""alien"" garnish for flavor.

Crab&Brie - For $11, this is a lot of friggin' crab. You blue crab lovers out there. This is your go to. This was the best thing to hit the table. Pros: Super crabby. Cons: Super crabby. It's really up to you but you could easily have too much of this. It does come in two crepes.

This may just be me, but I could have found the food on the plates to be a bit more hot.

Will I come back? I'll say thanks for time Cafe Conti. You have nice decor and have a lovely staff, but there's more to explore. Thank you!",2017-02-13 20:04:56

Blink and you'll miss it as there's no signage indicating where you should turn. It had been too long since I had seen M so we decided to meet up on a Friday night for an early dinner. Really early.

Located inside the Mosaic Centre, the building inside is beautiful with a contemporary, airy, spacious feel to it. Love one page menus. Things are split into bar snacks, small sharing plates, large plates and desserts. Entrees are on the pricier side ($22.00 to 34.00).

We sat at the bar as the place was packed. Honestly, we've never seen so many old people dining out (seemed to lack a ""diverse"" clientele according to M). This place is the spot if you want to pick up some grannies. The barman was nice enough but man, he was a non stop chatter box.

If you read the fine print, they say ""be patient - good things come to those who wait"". That definitely was the case during our meal. The patience part I mean. There was a huge break between our appetizers and entrée.

One more thing - so many people ordered the kimchi BBQ pork lettuce wraps. Asian dishes seem to be all the rage these days and Workshop Eatery is cashing in. I couldn't stop staring at their take on bo ssam.

- Chicken liver parfait ($14.00) - nice to see Bon Ton getting some love. Bread was still as good as I remember it; lightly toasted and complimented the smooth chicken liver. If you like pate, this is right up your alley. Only complaint was that there were only 5 pieces of bread!
- Duck carpaccio ($17.00) - M originally didn't like her first few bites but the dish grew on her. Flavours were interesting as it is very Asian-esque; you get bits of sweet and savoury, especially with the pickled shiitakes. We liked it.
- Pomegranate braised lamb shank ($34.00 - we decided to share an entrée as we were heading to Bar Bricco afterwards. The lamb was a bit dry; we had some difficulty cutting the meat off the shank. It was still tasty but don't expect fall off the bone tenderness. The faro wasn't as flavourful as Alberta Hotel's version (which was just divine). The beets were almost inedible; they were rock hard.

Can't say too much as we only tried a sampling of the new menu but based on location and price, I can't see myself coming all the way out here again anytime soon.",2016-05-04 15:35:11

And I would rate it 5 stars every time I went.  The last time I ate here was about 2 weeks ago when my father and sister were in town.  The food and service had been outstanding before, so I knew I had to take them before they returned back to Pi-less Omaha.

The beer here is outstanding.  They serve Schlafly on tap, which is amazing.  My sister had the Octoberfest, and she raved about it the rest of her vacation here.

The food, also outstanding.  We had the hummus plate for an appetizer, split a plate of the dried bing cherry salad between my boyfriend, my dad, my sister, and me.  Then we got one small pan pizza and one large pan pizza.  Our server, Mark, recommended the hummus plate to us.  He was awesomely honest (""I don't like hummus, but I have heard we have some of the best homemade hummus in St. Louis!"")  I liked that although he's not a fan of the food in general, he was able to really ""sell"" it to us.  As for the salad, well I am a picky eater when it comes to salad, and this was delicious!  I can't remember what the small pizza was (one of their named ones, I didn't eat it) but everybody in my party seemed to enjoy it.  We also got pepperoni, roaster red peppers, and fresh tomatoes on the large one, and it was perfect.  The crust is just AMAZING.  I can't say enough good things about the crust.  It's so crispy and cornmealy and perfect.  Some people may not like the fact that there really is not much cheese on it, but these pizzas are perfect without adding more (unless that is your thing; you can always add extra cheese!)  My dad finished his meal with some cinnamon ice cream.  He was hoping it wasn't like his storebought cinnamon ice cream, since he claims it lacks flavor.  Pi's version:  perfect!  Lots of flavor.  My sister and I split the vegan (!) chocolate chip cookie sandwich.  It was so delicious!

We went on a very busy night.  We got there and there were still tables open (indoors and out) but by the time we got our appetizer, the place filled up.  You would think that this would give us a lesser quality of service, but not this night!  Our server Mark was right on point.  Even though he was ""running"" between all his tables, he still managed to look at our table every time to make sure we weren't low on drinks and that we had everything we wanted.  He was super friendly, and didn't make us think twice about leaving a hefty tip.

I'll definitely be back here, and hopefully sooner rather than later.  I have visions of deep dish dancing in my head.",2011-11-01 15:03:49
W54dolEjIiTatbH5Ey_ZuQ,A7CIyRrCic7392kihfO9cw,BIW1SKq5ItkA9gP6-FhSkA,4.0,16,4,8,"After seeing the news reports the past few weeks announcing the opening of this world famous soul food restaurant coming to our town I was extremely excited to try it out but figured I would give them a week to work out the glitches that come with opening a new restaurant.

Finally! The wife and I tried this place out last night and we were not disappointed in the least. We got there around 7:30 and the place had a dozen or so customers in the dining room. The place is nicely decorated, the room is inviting and feels comfy. From the hostess to the wait staff, everyone is attentive and courteous, the menu is simple and well laid out with a nice story on the back cover talking about how Ms. Sylvia got her start.

We were seated right away and promptly greeted by our waiter George who took our drink orders and appetizer order....Fried Green Tomatoes! Yummy! It was not even ten minutes and the appetizer came out and let me tell you, these were on the money! These were not tiny slices of green tomatoes, these were large, perfectly sliced with a light batter that stuck to them, they were delicious and some of the best I have ever eaten....a must try for anyone craving a fried green tomato.

For dinner, I ordered the ribs and fried chicken (dark meat) combo meal with two sides, collard greens and candied yams. My wife ordered the fried catfish with collard greens and baked mac and cheese. Again, our meals came out promptly and presented well on the plate. My ribs were good, fall off the bone good! My fried chicken quarter was perfectly cooked, the skin was crispy and the inside meat was moist. My only grumble was the chicken had not been warmed up enough, the chicken meat was lukewarm. On the other hand, my two sides were awesome! The collard greens are some of the best I ever ate and the candied yams were amazing! They could be considered a dessert and something I know my picky five year old would love to eat.

My wife's fried catfish was also a hit! George our waiter had recommended this dinner and he was right, it is delicious and cooked to perfection. Somehow Sylvia's has the right combo for perfecting the breading on their fried foods, it is light, not greasy and it sticks perfectly when cooked. Like me, she raved about the collard greens and her baked mac and cheese was by far some of the best ever, this place nails it when it comes to good soul food.

Of course our dinner would not be complete without trying the dessert, again we turned to our waiter George for his take on the desserts, he suggested the peach cobbler with ice cream.....again, this guy delivered! I am not a huge dessert person and if we do order dessert we usually share one, this time my wife had a hard time keeping me from eating the whole thing, it was on the money!

And speaking of money. In closing, this place will not break your bank account. The prices are very reasonable and affordable, it is family friendly and you get real value for what you spend here. The two of us walked out of here spending just around fifty dollars for dinner, appetizer, dessert and a glass of wine....now that's a good deal! We will be back!",2013-11-13 13:28:13

Men's Wearhouse, I'm sorry I'm not bald or old-looking.  I'm so sorry that you assumed I don't have money and couldn't be taken seriously.  I'm sorry your entire staff decided to elicit a haunting quiet across the room and stare right at me, while, at the same time, pretending that no one walked through the doors at all.

When I finally got service in the tuxedo area, the fella was so damn reluctant to help me that he didn't offer to assist me in looking at various jackets or anything of that nature.  He seemed perplexed when I asked to look at a black tie instead of a white one.  He had to dig through the sale merchandise and open up a black tie out of its package; he handed it to me with a shrug, as if to say, ""here's that strange object you wanted.""  I just assumed he was a suit salesman who had gotten stuck in the tux section for the day.  

When I decided I'd do better just to shift my attention to suits, he said, ""I don't know; I'm the tuxedo salesman.""  Are you kidding me?! It was like a punch line to a bad joke.  

I thought for sure this would get better once I started looking for suits, but it didn't.  First, the staff acted like they were scolding a little child for being indecisive.  They couldn't believe that I had come to look for a tuxedo AND a suit.  Next, my new salesman tried to come down on me for wearing a Saints shirt on a home-game weekend.  Again, I'm sorry, Men's Wearhouse--I'm so sorry I showed support for the team that represents my own hometown IN that same hometown--and you hired one of these misanthropes who loves showing people, every chance he gets, how he's different; he's from another team or some sad Northern town, or whatever, and he just has to show you.  

Now, I know I have belly.  And I know that presents a fitting problem.  But after you've told me about it a couple of times, you really needn't keep repeating it.  After the tenth time, perhaps you should get your act together, stop showing me that you don't like the Saints--or my belly!--and try to help me find a suit!

What a ridiculous and sad place!  I guarantee you'll find it creepy in there--just plain creepy.  I also guarantee that the staff is incompetent, and some of the suits are overpriced.  I guarantee you'll like anything, even being punched in the face, better than Men's Wearhouse.",2014-11-12 19:00:23

New Orleans is full of history and that is my guilty pleasure. The for story mansion was built in 1830 and owned by Pierre Soule for his new wife. But this now renovated mansion serves up crepes and delightfully fresh cocktails to their guests. We came on Father's Day and it was a gorgeous day out. The front arched windows were opened to watch people walk by as we enjoyed our cuisine. Our waitress Suzanne (pronounced Sue-zahn) was an absolute joy! She also said she goes by ""the old lady"", but that's just NO! She was charming and funny and knew so much history on the city. Best tour guide! No need to pay for a tour, she will tell you all the great spots venture to. 

The menu had so many tantalizing items we couldn't choose one entrée each. Mike and I decided to order 3 entrées to split. Of course, I saw the crepes and ordered Nutella with strawberries, and the spinach and bacon quiche. Mike ordered the Benedict's Egg Soule. They also had a fresh squeezed lemonade with fresh crushed watermelon and I believe it was with gin. A tart and sweet refresher for a hot summers day.  

When our meals came we were taken aback. A plentiful bounty of food! The eggs Benedict Soule were poached eggs atop large plump crab cakes, a slice of fried green tomatoes and an English muffin on bottom, with of course a hollandaise. Seriously, the best thing you'll put in your mouth. I'm sad I had only one bite, but it was one I won't soon forget. The crab cake melted away on my tongue. I had to start my meal with the crepe. I take my dessert before my meals. Heaven on a plate and Nutella all over! Ok, how can you hate Nutella? And fresh strawberries?!? This crepe was massive! I've only had crepes in Greece and they are much thinner and not as jam packed. I fell in love! Eating this sweet crepe put me in a trance! Oh man I want another! Ok ok, the quiche! This thick, large sliced wedge that looked like pie was insane! The crust was soft with a light crisp that would break apart in your mouth. The spinach and bacon were the true star! I've never had such an amazing experience!  We were so lucky to have this experience in a gorgeous historic city. I can't wait to come back here for more amazing food, fresh cocktails and of course to get more hot spots from Suzanne.  

Also, on the second floor is The Paris Room, which is a ballroom that holds many Mardi Gras parties as well as wedding receptions. There is a bar, a street balcony and outside terrace as well.

I sat on this review to have a clear head, but the unprofessional behavior is just a matter of fact, & it really needs to be addressed by corporate.

This week I visited to make a return of online items, & shop around afterward. Just before 8:30pm, I approached the counter with a genuine smile, & an apology (though unnecessary), for the fact of my return of part of an online order. The associate I encountered was a young woman (name is not on receipt). The first thing she did was complain that she wanted her 15min break. I smiled, but couldn't really help her with that, so she didn't have more to say. She took her time with the items I was returning, & somehow managed to make a 60-second transaction last for TWELVE MINUTES.

The issue? I was returning a 3-pack of baby shirts. She ripped the bag open & proceeded to scan each one. As she did it, I explained to her, ""This is a 3-pack, so I don't think you have to scan all three."" She insisted that she did. Of course, they didn't all register. She sat staring at them. Minutes ticked by as she looked at the shirts, scanned them a 2nd, & 3rd time. I kept patient, but gently mentioned I had to hit two more stores before the mall closed at 9pm. She ignored me, looked at the packing slip, looked at her computer. I reiterated that it was a 3-PACK, & that normally only one item scans. I said I could see on the computer that it had scanned, so that was all I needed. She ignored me. I tried explaining the phenomenon of a 3-pack to her in another way. I pointed to the title on my return slip ""THREE PACK"" & reminded her that, before she scanned them, she had had to unseal the package they were all in together, as a set of three. She just stood there with a pissy face, not making eye contact, like I was trying to confuse her, or return the wrong item. I have no idea why this was such a problem.

Finally, she rang everything up yet ANOTHER time & said ""Ohhhh, it's a three pack.""

Are you kidding me?

So she's at the tail end of this RIDICULOUSLY annoying experience, but still, calls her manager up to ""make sure I am doing this right."" What is there to ""do right""??? The item rang up the first of the fifty times you did it. Just hit ""process refund"" & let me get the heck out of here.

The manager came over, & she decided to take a phone call right when he arrived. He asked me why he was there? I had no idea. I said I was waiting for my refund. The girl did not place her caller on hold to finish her job with my transaction, nor did her manager ask her to hold the call so they could take care of the customer standing right in front of them. It was the most willfully unprofessional series of choices I have witnessed at a register in my life. Who does that? ANY of that? Who does that?

So then the manager starts opening up a side register to check the balance of the gift card the woman had been using to refund my purchase (I had paid with Visa & gift card, & they were putting it, annoyingly, on gc). So I sit there while he decides to do this. WHY ARE YOU NOT ASKING YOUR ASSOCIATE, RIGHT HERE, WHAT IS GOING ON?

Meanwhile, the phone conversation was this associate telling the caller all the excuses why she was not going to go on the floor to check & see if they have X item in stock, b/c if the online data says there is one, it really means there are none, & on & on. First of all, that is totally unprofessional. Just go & check. Even if you ""know"" it won't be there, go & check. Second, it is not appropriate to launch into some lengthy who/what/when/where/why of the inaccuracies of the Old Navy inventory system to a customer (which I am sure this woman is not very knowledgeable about anyway, since she can't understand what a 3-pack is). She watched her manager fumble around trying to complete my transaction without having a clue what she had been doing, & she just kept yabbing away, letting me sit there.

I honestly felt like they were choosing to be obnoxious & waste my time. I know that retail is stressful, & you absorb a lot of nastiness from customers, but I behaved politely, & exercised a lot of patience, while also letting them know I needed to get to other stores before close, so why they would behave in ANY of the ways they did, is just wrong. 

The manager then opened yet a third register on the other side of the original. He failed to communicate what on earth he was doing. I asked ""Did she put the refund on there?"" His answer was yes. Then why the HECK didn't he tell me that? Why keep checking? On top of this, the refund was less than I paid, but I neutrally told him I'd rather call online to fix it b/c I didn't have any more time. He gave me no thanks, & no apology. He did give me a snooty look.

So, this is all going on a feedback survey, & hopefully corporate cares. I definitely do NOT want to go back if these folks are on duty.",2019-05-18 10:14:32

We started the evening with dinner at Oak, then headed to L27 for a New Years toast. We were promptly informed that the fee was $150 per person but they would not sell us a ticket because they were unsure of the actual price since we were 10 minutes before midnight. The desk could not reach a manager and made us wait in the hallway. When a manager was finally reached we were told we had to wait anyway because they had 200+ champagne toasts to handout. So my husband and I spent the ball dropping in the hallway. After dropping $400 at Oak, this is how we were treated. I was furious. 

Frustrated and angry, we headed downstairs for a final drink prior to calling for an Uber. Soon after we heard screaming in the lobby. We thought it was maybe drunk people taking things too far. We promptly witnessed an older gentleman with blood pouring from his face and several women screaming at staff to call 911 - which they did not do right away. At the main entrance there was blood and glass everywhere. It was apparent that man was attacked with a glass object and the suspect fled on foot. The victim was checking on a young lady the suspect was screaming at. He did so respectfully after the suspect initially stepped away from her. The suspect returned and attacked the man from behind, fleeing on foot. 

The main entrance was never closed despite it being a slippery bloody mess and glass filled crime scene. People were walking through a crime scene of blood and broken glass. People even brought their dogs down and walked right through it. 

Next, housekeeping showed up and MOPPED up the blood before authorities arrived, tampering with a crime scene and spreading a bloody mess around with a NASTY MOP. Blood must be cleaned up in a certain way. The mop was red when housekeeping finished. When the authorities finally arrived and helped the victim out via ambulance, an attempt was made to clean the blood from the leather bench he sat upon. The leather was porous so the blood had soaked into some places. People soon started to sit upon it - an unsanitized bench where the blood was not properly cleaned. We informed them and they were equally disgusted. 

It was clear to me the hotel did not care about their guests, wellbeing, and patronage. I cannot say that I will ever return to this place. I am disgusted with my NYE experience.",2020-01-01 20:02:30

I like this place and I'd say I am a fan...but only if I was already nearby and couldn't decide on somewhere else to go.

I've never felt very welcome at Hawthorne's even though their business is perfectly aligned with my personal interests. I feel like if anyone from the business reads this, they're just going to laugh it off..but I'll share anyway.

I stopped in last weekend with a friend I hadn't seen in nearly two years. It was her pick for brunch. I arrived first and put my name on the list for a table. A second later my phone lit up and said to check in. They don't seat until all parties are present, but fortunately she walked in a few minutes later.

For drinks, I ordered two for us to share -- a cider and a sour. It turned out the sour had kicked, so my friend chose a beer that their ""sour guy"" recommended to her. It was one I'd had before, so we didn't share after all. I was a bit miffed that she was treated like the only sour fan from that point on. The guy even gave her a full size sample of some pour by The Bruery. I would've liked to try it too, and I kind of wish he had considered that two people were seated at the table.

For my meal, I ordered the 11th Street Omelet without peppers. When it came out, there were two peppers placed atop the omelet. I explained that I asked for it without peppers and the lady kind of blankly stared back. I said peppers make me very ill, and she said there weren't any inside of it. It was a garnish.

I pointed out that the pepper juice was on the omelette itself and she made no move to fix it or apologize, so I scooped them off myself and hoped for the best. Fortunately I didn't get sick, but they should really be more sensitive to diner's diets. The omelet itself was very good.

Near the end of the meal, our main server who had been a hoot up until that point, asked if I needed a neck rub because I looked so tense. I wasn't tense. I have diagnosed back issues so I guess I don't always look normal. That just made me feel really self conscious and out of place. So really, don't go unless you're in perfect shape with no health issues, I guess..?

Their beer selection is fairly stellar. In the past they've hosted some incredible beer events. I even had Sip of Sunshine on my birthday in 2016.

Naturally, I found myself digging around Trivago looking for the nicest hotel I could find for the most reasonable rate possible. Surprisingly, I found this hotel (Sheraton) for a very reasonable $99.00 a night plus tax. All I needed was a standard king room. My first impression was not great, but as you can see, it's a five star review; you'll see an explanation later on in the review.

I made the reservation on the Sheraton website and immediately got in the car and drove over from Oro Valley. I arrived at about 6:30. At the desk, there were two female guest service agents: one who was checking-in a couple, and one who diddled around on the keyboard with a scowl on her face for what seemed to be five minutes. Eventually, she asked if I was with the couple. That question struck me as odd, as they were clearly not old enough to be my parents, and I was standing far enough behind them. Anyway, she took my form of payment and my ID, and took about another 5 minutes looking at the computer. Then, she tells me that she doesn't know why it said on the reservation that I reserved a standard king, but that it was really a handicap accessible king room, and that it was mostly the same, just with a slightly different configuration. When I asked her if the hotel was full, and that was all that they could give me, she repeated in a curt fashion what she had said before, that it was just slightly different, but mostly the same- completely disregarding my question. Okay, whatever; how bad could the room be? It's a Sheraton. Well...

After that off-putting check-in experience, I pulled my car around the back and parked. When I got out, and walked into the building, and found out that it was the very first room on the left when entering the building, I thought it was convenient. Upon entering the room, It was clear it had been renovated within the last few years; seemingly, it was in very good condition. It had a cartoonish kind of feel which is all too common now.  What really put me off was the bathroom; it looked like a bathroom that you'd see in a hospital room. There was absolutely no vanity, so nowhere to put toiletries, and the free toiletries that they provide was on a tray sitting on the toilet cistern. That isn't what I'd expect from a Sheraton. I've seen more luxurious bathrooms in a Days Inn or Lazy 8. The toilet cistern also wobbled when you flushed it, as if it wasn't properly bolted to the bowl upon installation. When I got in bed to watch tv, I could hear an awful lot of noise coming from the entry of the building. Cars coming in and parking, bell carts, elevator motor, talking, entry doors slamming, you name it. I was starting to see how I got the great deal; I was shafted for not paying enough. There was no way I was going to sleep in this room.

After I was in the room an hour, I decided to leave and grab a bite to eat. While I was out, I decided I'd complain when I got back. When I returned at about 10:30, I phoned the front desk. Cici, the night auditor answered the phone, and I let her know what was going on. Despite the complaining, she was very amiable and apologetic; she wanted to know who it was who did this to me, and if I wanted to move rooms. I wanted to move. All I was expecting was what I had reserved: a standard king room. Instead, she upgraded me to a king suite for the same rate, no questions asked. This hotel has Cici to thank for salvaging my impression of this hotel. I went from either wanting to never stay here again, and ask for a refund if they failed to give me what I wanted, to having a very favorable opinion of it. Thank you, Cici! You are truly a class-act.

The new room is so much better. Not only is it in a quiet location, but the bathroom is what I'd expect from a hotel of this caliber. The toilet and shower are seperate from the vanity, which is right outside the bathroom. The trendy rainfall showerhead with a glass partition for the shower was an interesting touch, but not practical; the floor would get soaking wet. I'd also imagine it would be costly to change when that design falls out-of-style. The toilet was one of those sleek Japanese units that worked very well despite using a minimal amount of water. The living room was great. It featured a TV, desk, and sofa. The living room TV, however, was much smaller and older than the larger, and more modern version in the bedroom. What I didn't like was the hospitality grade DirecTV service that they have on the TV; despite having pause/play and rw/ff controls on the remote, you could not use any of those functionalities.

Never in my almost 20 years of staying in hotels, have I seen a hotel start out problematic, and turn things around so easily, and without having to beg to get what I payed for. In fact, I got more! Because of this, I would absolutely recommend this hotel to friend, and would consider staying here again.",2019-10-19 07:10:26

I found it a little chaotic, but definitely see the appeal of the fast-paced upbeat atmosphere. The person who took our orders made a rather big blunder and included a 4th meal with our order. (I thought my total bill was too high, but due to how busy the order counter was, and how long we all were waiting, I had simply paid the total. ) When the wait staff brought 4 meals to our table of 3 we discovered the error. Our wait person was bewildered, had no idea how to fix it, so we said we would just take it home and she bagged it up for us. 
I ordered a Leatherface burger with avocado. First I'll say the meat itself was cooked perfectly, but they were way too generous with the condiments so I ended up trying to scrape some off. Though the menu offers ""avocado,"" it's not slices of avocado but rather an avocado spread that doesn't have much flavor, so I tried to scrape that off as well after paying extra for it. 
Dinner companions had a Boston Strangler cheesesteak and a Taking Lives panini. They said each were very good and left no crumbs behind! The cheesesteak had tender cubes of  beef rib eye, grilled onions, and blue cheese. The Taking Lives panini was spicy (as desired) and grilled perfectly. The table shared both onion rings and fries which were both very good. 
Value was average. Portions were adequate. We aren't beer drinkers, but they have an extensive beverage list that most diners appeared to enjoy. 
We may be back, but may do takeout instead of dine-in. The beef is flavorful and tender.  I recommend asking them to go light on condiments and skip the ""avocado.""
This rating was a little difficult because the quality of the food itself was good, but the overuse of condiments obscured this. I would rate the food quality 4 to 4.5. Service, however, was closer to a 2. There should be more than 1 person taking orders in a restaurant this size, and that person shouldn't be doing beer tastings. They have a separate register for beer orders (and no one in line when we were there). There should be a read-back of orders to ensure accuracy (at which point I would have caught there were more than 3 meals), and servers should know what to do when they discover errors have occurred.",2019-05-20 17:56:45

I want to feel like I have had a better than average experience. I just don't ever get that here. I certainly do pop in a few times a month but it's not a stop I look forward to making. I venture in expecting to leave frustrated. 

Pros~ Chicken is on sale on Tuesday. Little Big Meals. Chopped Smoked Salmon is a great deal. Beautiful floral selection. They have a great selection of meats and seafood, which I do not utilize that often. 

Cons~ Their level of customer service leaves a lot to be desired in my book . Getting service at the prepared food section and meat/seafood dept. is tough. The employees are always preoccupied. They work on island time and that's not how I roll. There are lots of employees working,  just not servicing the customer. My latest experience involved a lady filling in the seafood case. She kept coming and going. Never once looked at me much less spoke. Once complete she asked to help me. I called later that evening to speak to the manager on duty. I was on hold 13.25 minutes before he came to the phone. 

The prepared food section is filled with mostly processed high fat unhealthy choices. It even has that processed taste, in my opinion. I steer clear. 

I was surprised to see the olive bar open to customers during this time of Florida being the epicenter of Covid . There were no gloves, wipes, etc. available. I did not observe anyone using the self serve bar. I asked , Al or Alan (I have forgotten his name) about the concern I had regarding the spread of germs. His response was that they wipe the utensils down about every 30- 60 minutes . Lol ! Are you kidding me ? I would have that expectation during normal times. Now I question their level of cleanliness in general. 

In a nutshell shell , it goes back to how I feel after each experience. They just don't do it. Will I go back ? Yes, on occasion, for the smoked salmon and an occasional meal deal.  If I can purchase what they offer anywhere else it will be cheaper and it will be served with a smile . They don't deliver that. That's what the customer wants in the end.  I'm surprised they are still in business.",2020-07-20 22:10:32
Yl6NHQX1pHNy9nJOVBJkUg,NuM3yHO4x3hMbcluYHlfsw,qISf5ojuYbD9h71NumGUQA,2.0,4,1,0,"I have to say that my first experience with Han Dynasty was with the owner/manager who picked up the phone on a Tuesday night.  To say that the owner/manager was extremely rude, is the nicest way of putting it.

My sister and I were walking there and thought of calling head to see how busy they were to see if they could accommodate us - if not, we planned just to go somewhere else.  I called and asked if there was a need to make reservations for dining that night.  He replied by asking what time, and when I mentioned that I was asking because we were walking that way (arrival within 20 mins) and was wondering if there would be possiblity of seating. He responded (again, rudely), ""Well, I guess it doesn't matter about reservations.  Luck for you we are dead and you can have a seat.""  

We walked into the restaurant (better decorated that most Chinese restaurants) and waited for our server, the owner/manager who had answered the phone came by with our server and started speaking to us as though we were complete morons and stared at my nephew as though he was a piece of trash when he (age 2) was playing with the chopsticks.  Speaking over our server, he made suggestions rather rudely and short with a level of curtness that I was not ready for.  Being a 2nd generation Asian American, I tried to trust that maybe he had not fully acclimated to the American culture.  

We ended up ordering 
Fried Taiwanese Sausage (for the nephew - he loved it)
semi-sweet and well, tastes like a sausage.

Fish Dry Pot
 It was pretty good with a nice spice, but not a total Szechuan Gastronomic experience that othershave described it as.  It was pretty good compared to the bad and mediocre Szechuan restaurants 
that are out there, but nothing to write home about.  This dish was the start the slew of entrees that were unbalanced.  The Chinese 5 Spice overpowered almost everything. That is all I could taste - but then again, I am not a huge fan of it - too much anise/cloves?

Chicken Hot Sauce Style
 The flavor, I could tell, was good, but the sauce was so over-starched, it might pretty much was a gelatinous goop of good flavor mixed with the tinge of too much corn starch - mistake only poorer cooks would make.  I was pretty disappointed.  There was a pile of minced garlic sitting on the top that seemed a bit much of a punch of flavor to this already flavorful dish.  I understand the need to garnish a dish to make it look  fancier than your local Chinatown dish, but it just was not balance with this edible garnish/whatever it was.

Salt and Pepper Style Shrimp
 How can you really go wrong with fried food?!?! This salt and pepper shrimp was pretty good, but  all I could taste here was the five spice powder, too.

The server that came was pretty good at his job - friendly, warm and understood English, but I felt bad that the owner/manager kept on showing up and ruining our experience by staring at us (wanting us to relinquish the table faster no doubt) and making his own suggestions.


Overall:

Atmosphere:  bare, but better than most Chinese restaurants (at least more westernized?)
Service:  Fine as long as the Owner/Manager doesn't get involved
Food:  Better than most Szechuan cuisine I've had, but slightly above average.",2010-09-27 18:47:57

People from bigger cities lament the fact that oh, we don't really have a Ktown here or even a respectable Chinatown...or that we have a handful of Mexican eateries instead of 9 blocks, blah, blah, blah. But the truth is...if you really wanted to find some edible standout in some culture, you probably could make it with some help from Global.

Their produce section is very reasonably priced; the Asian vegetables and the herbs much more so. Sometimes, the ""regular"" produce is not as fresh as it is at Schnucks or Dierbergs, but there is plenty of thai mint or gai lan or yu choy. 

I love how there is a little bit of everything, and how it is all labeled by cuisines. Except for the cookies and candies: that has its own location right before you hit the produce --the manager is someone after my own heart.

Labne? Turkish cotton candy? Mango chutney? Sauerbraten mix? Kimchi? Puri? Rabbit sausage?? IT'S ALL HERE! And it's so fun to go up and down the aisles and just dump in your cart random things to try and cook. 

This Indian guy who was stocking the Indian snacks saw me poring over the puri and the ready-to-eat samosas. He indicated to me with a raised eyebrow, ""The samosas are hot."" I chuckled, was like, okay, but how are they? Should I get them or should I get the freezer kind? (BTW, thanks for not telling me to make my own, lol, especially because you saw I had paneer in my cart.). He was like, They're ok. Pause. Then he goes, But you should try the kachori; they are better. LIke how many times have you stood in front of the shelves and wondered, which mandu do those Asian people buy? Or which brand lumpia is the best? Or which samosas would an Indian auntie hope to pass off as her own? What is that orange stuff in the Russian aisle? Those are the questions I always have...and those are the questions that the staff here will answer...or try to find someone who knows. 

Having spent most of the past year in rural areas, it nearly made me cry to see beef tongue. And cut gyro meat. And pelmeni. And headcheese. A whole entire two shelves just devoted to feta. And for what they have, prices are reasonable. 

I just wish they offered threading. I should ask them next time.",2015-02-19 21:21:54
a0y_UyK57gQMMwdMTGdoqg,QLaldnZE_Rf4hQQkrODZBQ,3ZpLxaLK1dM5t3-pyUhh7w,1.0,3,0,0,"When a man from Horizon named Ricardo came to my house to investigate why I had no heat I was totally taken aback by his rudeness, his apathy and his complete lack of customer service skills. The temperature in my house was 47 degrees even with the space heater on. He briefly touched the radiators and said they were warm so my system must be ok. I couldn't believe that he didn't see anything wrong with the way that it felt in there. I had a coat on and was dressed in layers. My hands and face were ice cold. When I called my landlord he didn't answer so I had to leave a voicemail. I asked Ricardo if he would talk to my landlord and he angrily snapped, ""NO! I don't want to do that!!!"" After I left a voicemail telling my landlord that Horizon was there Ricardo said he didn't want to wait around to hear from my landlord. He said my house felt ok even though the space heater's digital thermometer said it was 47 degrees in there. As he started to walk out the door he told me that my landlord better call in a few minutes or he would leave because HE had to get PAID. He already had my landlord's credit card number. 

I was very upset and panicky from the heat not working and from Ricardo's rude, snippy and unhelpful attitude. When he came back inside he briefly went down to my basement. When he came back up he proclaimed that the WHOLE system needed to be replaced and it would cost $10,000-$15,000! That seemed way off to me but I told him that my landlord wanted me to ask if he could check out the vacant upstairs' unit while he was there. Ricardo sneered as he said, ""NO! That's a whole new unit entirely! I'm not doing that!"" He charged my landlord $85 for the ""consultation"" and then left after my landlord called me back and the 2 of them discussed Ricardo's ""findings"". 

Not long after that my landlord called me back and said that he was able to find an independent contractor named Wally who was on his way over. When he checked it out he told me all that my heating system needed was a new transformer and a new thermostat. As he was working on that he said, ""It's companies like Horizon that give legitimate plumbers/hvac people a bad name."" He said that HE likes to do the best he can for people and likes to be able to sleep at night with a clear conscience. He told me what probably happens with companies like Horizon. He suspects that their technicians see people for maybe 10 or 15 minutes for a ""consultation"" and then they bill the customers for a whole hour. Over the course of one day's work by doing that they could then charge for 15 hours but actually only work 8 hours and then they also get a commission by selling all of these extras with inflated costs to their victims who are desperate and don't know any better, particularly the most vulnerable --the poor and the elderly. 

To say that I am very disappointed in my experience with Horizon is an understatement. I have to remind myself that it was just one person who ruined my perception of them but after reading the other reviews it doesn't seem like this is an isolated instance. It is clear that Ricardo was nothing like how they claim to be in their commercials but at least my landlord didn't have to pay a fortune to have something replaced that didn't need to be replaced. I still feel angry about the way that I was treated and the fact that he tried to rip off my landlord. I also feel bad for all of the people who were scared and scammed into spending thousands of dollars on something that they didn't even need. I hope this review can result in a change in the way that Horizon trains their employees but if it doesn't then I hope it can at least prevent others from being ripped off.",2018-01-10 17:46:45
