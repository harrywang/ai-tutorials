Headless Wordpress + Next.js + ElasticSearch



tutorial


website



This past May 27th marks the 20th Anniversary of Wordpress. I have been using Wordpress for more than 15 years, e.g., I adopted Wordpress for CSWIM in 2012 as a conference co-chair and Wordpress has been powering many websites I built.
Recently, we needed to integrate a CMS with our main site at Takin.AI and chose to use a Headless Wordpress after looking into many other options, such as Strapi, Sanity, etc. The main reason to choose Wordpress is because I know Wordpress very well and we have a Wordpress hosting plan on SiteGround for years.
Basic Setup
We are quite happy with the integration shown at Takin.AI Learning Center and the key steps for this implementation is as follows:

Get a vanilla Wordpress working on SiteGround
Install WP GraphQL plugin to serve the contents via API
Install WP Githuber MD plugin to author contents using Markdown
Develop the frontend using Next.js and host it on Vercel
Redirect the WP frontend using a custom theme I developed and keep /wp-admin only for content authoring
Optimize the performance by installing WP GraphQL Smart Cache and other methods

ElasticSearch via ElasticPress Plugin
Follow the steps below to add search using ElasticPress Plugin and ElasticSearch (ES)

Change the default ES username and password:



add the username/pwd by adding one line define( 'ES_SHIELD', '<username>:<password>' ); to the wp-config.php file using SiteGround UI:



Check the connection - the warnings can be ignored:



Sync the posts information to the ES server:



Check the index created in ES:



Check the contents in ES:
