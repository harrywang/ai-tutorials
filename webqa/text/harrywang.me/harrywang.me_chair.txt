The Nakashima Lounge Chair



design


woodworking


hobby


I built the Lounge Chair designed by George Nakashima at the “Wang Yan” woodworking workshop (忘言手作) in Shenzhen, China (April - May, 2017). I learned lots of woodworking skills from my instructors and gave the chair to my father.







I visited the George Nakashima Studio in Hope, PA (September 2019) - highly recommend the studio tour: beautiful furniture and architecture. I was lucky enough to meet with George Nakashima’s daughter Mira Nakashima and got her autograph for her father’s book “The Soul of a Tree”.
