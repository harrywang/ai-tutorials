Tailpages (Tailwind + Github Pages)



tutorial


open-source





My team started to use Tailwind CSS a few months ago and I want to learn a little bit more about it so that I don’t feel like a complete idiot in some technical discussions :). So, I started a small project to design a Jekyll template using TailwindCSS.
Tailpages (Tailwind + Github Pages) is a Jekyll website template based on TailwindCSS, which can be hosted by Github for free. You can visit the demo site at https://harrywang.me/tailpages/.

Key features are:

Minimalist design inspired by the indigo template
Elegant typography via TailwindCSS Typography plugin and Inter font
Markdown support for content authoring (static pages and blogs)
Code highlighting and styling via highlight.js (see code example)
Latex support via MathJax (see an example)
Table of Contents support via jekyll-toc (see an example)
