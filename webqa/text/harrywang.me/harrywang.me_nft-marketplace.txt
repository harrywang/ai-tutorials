CloseSea - the Smallest NFT Marketplace



tutorial


open-source



I developed and deployed CloseSea: the smallest NFT marketplace :) based on the great tutorial by Nader Dabit.
I added a few things on top of Nader’s tutorial:

how to add NFT traits in metadata and how they will be displayed on OpenSea
how to manage the contract as a owner, e.g., change the listing fee and withdraw the money from the contract address
how to verify the contract, estimate gas, and deploy the app to Vercel

You can play with the demo at https://closesea-one.vercel.app/, which uses the contract deployed on Rinkeby - you need to connect your wallet, switch to Rinkeby network, and use test Rinkeby eth to list and trade.
The listed/minted NFTs can be seen at https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/closesea-collection.
The code and docs can be accessed at Repo.
The followings are used in this project:

Solidity
Hardhat
Alchemy
Rinkeby/Mumbai/Polygon
OpenZeppelin
Ethers.js
Next.js
TailwindCSS
