Setup Websites using SiteGround



tutorial


website



This post is mainly for myself - I write down the operations I often need to setup websites here to save time: I setup only a few websites a year and often forget what I did when trying to setup a new one.
Setup Domain Name and Email


Register domain on GoDaddy


Create a website in SiteGround:




Create empty site and finish:



Change the name servers in GoDaddy to use SiteGround for DNS:

ns1.siteground.net

ns2.siteground.net


Go to site tools of SiteGround to setup emails:


Setup a new Wordpress Website

Create a new Wordpress installation
Install a professional theme, such as https://themeforest.net/item/salient-responsive-multipurpose-theme/4363266
Find a demo site and load the content
Customize the content

Clone/Migrate a Wordpress Website
The current Wordpress website is at 2022.yourwebsite.com, which you want to clone to 2023.yourwebsite.com.

Go to SiteGround and create the subdomain name 2023.yourwebsite.com:



Go to 2022 Wordpress Admin site and install SG Migrator plugin:



Go to 2023 SiteGround site and generate a migration token (Site Tools -> WordPress > Migrator):



Go back to 2022 Wordpress Admin site > open SG Migrator > paste the Token and start a clone/migration:



(Optional) Go to 2023 SiteGround site and flush the new 2023 Dynamic Cache: Site Tools > Speed > Caching > Dynamic Cache
