My Budget PC Build



tutorial



I replaced my old 2080ti GPU with a 4090 in my remote server and built a PC so that I can still use the 2080ti locally. I followed this great YouTube video and the process was quite easy.
I bought all parts from Amazon and the total is $583:

Motherboard: MSI B550-A PRO ProSeries Motherboard - $140
CPU: AMD Ryzen™ 5 5600 with Cooler - $129
RAM (16G): T-Force Vulcan Z DDR4 16GB Kit - $34
SSD (2T): Kingston NV2 2TB M.2 2280 NVMe Internal SSD - $85
Power Supply Unit (PSU): 750W Fully Modular RGB Power Supply - $80
Case: NZXT H5 Flow Compact ATX Mid-Tower PC Gaming Case - White - $95
USB Wifi: TP-Link AC1300 USB WiFi Adapter - $20

I then made a bootable USB from ISO image using Rufus and installed Windows 11. The PC is very quiet and nice-looking :).
