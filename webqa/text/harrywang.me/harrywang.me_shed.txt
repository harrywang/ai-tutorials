A Shed

hobby


As a summer project during the COVID-19 pandemic, I designed and built a minimalist modern shed, which is 8’ x 10’ with a slanted roof (8’ tall wall and 7’ short wall).
Video and Photos
I recorded the project using time lapse. The 5-minute video can be viewed at: Youtube and Meipai.
