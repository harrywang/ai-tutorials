Publish NPM and PyPI Packages



tutorial



This post is also for myself - I often want to register packages to https://www.npmjs.com/ and/or https://pypi.org/ and keep on looking for instructions that I forget. Please refer to the two great tutorials in the references section for details. I only list the key steps and notes that I often need to refer to below.
Setup Github Repo for the Package
The easiest way to start is to find an example repo and revise the package information:

https://github.com/harrywang/greeter-node (NPM): package info in package.json
https://github.com/harrywang/greeter-python (PyPI): package info is in setup.py. You also need to change package folder name to be consistent.

Package and Publish
You need to register accounts on https://www.npmjs.com/ and https://pypi.org/.
For NPM:
npm install
npm login
npm publish

Then, you should see your published package, e.g., https://www.npmjs.com/package/harry-greeter
For PyPI:
Find classifier (such as supported licenses) from https://pypi.org/classifiers/ for setup.py, then:
python setup.py sdist
twine upload dist/*

Then, you should see your published package, e.g., https://pypi.org/project/harrywang-greeter/
